EVERYDAYS A GOOD DAY WHEN YOU PAINT__***
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Is that from the wiki page?
Kugallyblitz:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kugallyblitz:	tl:dr Ross is love. Ross is life.
Master9000:	Career as a painter
While staying in Alaska, Ross was working as a part-time bartender when he discovered a TV show called The Magic of Oil Painting, hosted by German painter Bill Alexander.[5]:17‚Äì18 Ross studied with Alexander and afterwards discovered that he was able to earn more from selling his artwork than his position in the Air Force. Ross retired from the Air Force in 1981 after 20 years of service, having the rank of Master Sergeant,[6] and became famous worldwide for creating and hosting the TV program The Joy of Painting.[8]

Before the show launched, Ross had little success promoting his painting technique. His trademark permed hairstyle came about as a cost-cutting measure, when regular haircuts became too expensive. Ross was never comfortable with the style, but kept it throughout his career.[5]:19

The show had its first run from January 11, 1983, to May 17, 1994, but reruns still continue to appear in many broadcast areas and countries, including the PBS-oriented network Create. During each half-hour segment, Ross would instruct viewers in oil painting using a quick-study technique from the imagination that used a limited palette of paints and broke down the process into simple steps. Art critic Mira Schor compared him to Fred Rogers, host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, noting that Ross's soft voice and the slow pace of his speech were similar.[9]

Ross built a $15 million business selling his line of art supplies and how-to books, and marketing painting classes taught by instructors trained in the "Bob Ross method".[10] All of his income, he said, was derived from those sources; all of his paintings, including those created during his shows, were donated to PBS stations.[7][11]

Ross also filmed wildlife, squirrels in particular, usually in his garden, and he would often take in injured or abandoned squirrels and other animals. Small animals often appeared on his Joy of Painting canvasses.[7]

Nekomata_Kohaku:	Oh! I also found something in the tall grass at a bike path today XD
Nekomata_Kohaku:	I'm like 'well I don't like the thought of hitting kids then it makes me the bad guy owo'
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Like my little brother was like ' I'm surprised you didn't smack that kids hand away XD '
FLUBS:	haahhaha that is really cute
Nekomata_Kohaku:	I felt special around the little kids and they were amazed by all the Pok√©mon I got XD and one little girl...my dear god I'm like wearing a team valor shirt and she just out of the blue pokes at my chest saying." What's the name of that one?" o////o I knew she didn't know better but it was odd...
Master9000:	and properly made the servers able to host hundreds of millions of people
FLUBS:	also if they didnt remove the fun part
Master9000:	now if they did that starting this year can u imagine how much mroe hype the game couldve had
FLUBS:	it's really cute
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Yes x3
FLUBS:	i like the little pun in the bird names
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Then it changed to moltres
Nekomata_Kohaku:	The legendaries are out in raid battles today is the last day for articuno I think it ends tomorrow at 5pm
FLUBS:	i  beliee they made it not suck again

Kireina:	I'd be jealous of your 8 articuno's too
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Yes

Neon Strike Kitty:	Good night
superheronerd:	It's how they help their stomachs when they don't feel well
FLUBS:	benny once tried to even eat a nail
Dragonite:	thats another story
Dragonite:	licking the carpet though
Neon Strike Kitty:	My cats have sometimes eaten grass.
FLUBS:	my dogs eat anything not nailed down
Dragonite:	because ive never seen my dog eat grass
superheronerd:	They do
FLUBS:	poor little doggos. now theyre all sleepy
Dragonite:	do dogs actually eat grass
superheronerd:	Grass'll do it for them
FLUBS:	ill see how they are in the morning then decide about the vet
FLUBS:	hmm
FLUBS:	they may have eaten grass or something at the park
FLUBS:	that dog has made me lose lots of blood
FLUBS:	*benny noms finger*
Neon Strike Kitty:	All dogs act like that
FLUBS:	especially benny
Dragonite:	_pokes dog_
FLUBS:	and my dogs definitely act like theyre from hell.
FLUBS:	and that would work. apparently cerberus does sometimes have two heads
Neon Strike Kitty:	iirc Cerberus had a brother called Orthrus
FLUBS:	what cerberus? what you want something cute guarding the gates of hell?
Master9000:	**mildly**
Dragonite:	do they lick the carpet or something
Dragonite:	i remember my dog licking the carpet => dog throwing up
superheronerd:	That's mildly terrifying
FLUBS:	only two heads. i could be the third?
Master9000:	~~unless a body works as a head~~
Master9000:	he only has two dogs i think, the math doesnt work out
FLUBS:	bennny likes the souls
Neon Strike Kitty:	Cerberus?
FLUBS:	dog food. and human souls
superheronerd:	D:
Dragonite:	what did you feed them ffs
FLUBS:	oh she doesnt look too good. im gonna take them to the vet tomorrow

Deci:	cuz legit, it's getting old
Deci:	I'd really rahter not something be started up again, can we please refrain from insulting people, even when they're not here
Neon Strike Kitty:	Let's not.
FLUBS:	it has.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm kind of worried that bullying Gummy has become the "cool" thing to do.
FLUBS:	huh
Dragonite:	theoretically razors should just pass through the gelatin though
FLUBS:	to cause him pain
FLUBS:	He's *gummy*
Deci:	So, exactly *why* are you slashing gummy with a razor?
FLUBS:	i have 60 hours in a game you can beat in like 4
FLUBS:	yeah. except slashing gummy. that is real.
Dragonite:	i assume you are talking about Papers Please and not real life
FLUBS:	the moral problems are cool too. theres the right thing for your country, which is debatable, and the right thing for your family
Kireina:	Welcome, Welcome
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hello
Seto:	hey

Kireina:	lol
FLUBS:	and one about being a guard at a border
Dragonite:	I mean there was a game about being a freaking guard at a pizza place
Dragonite:	I think that has some potential
Dragonite:	a PC being a literal potato?
FLUBS:	i might look into that
FLUBS:	oh thats a cool concept for a game
superheronerd:	Though my pc is a literal potato
superheronerd:	Homefront. My friend gifted me it because he's a cool bean
FLUBS:	what game?
superheronerd:	Sorry I was redeeming a game. I'm pst, as panda said

SquidofBaconator:	I think I'll go to bed soon. Got class tomorrow morning and I need sleep. Good night.
Kireina:	uhh.. one sec lemme check the shelf
FLUBS:	what book?
Kireina:	Speaking of which I need to finish this book eventually...
superheronerd:	I recently tried wading in the ocean waves
Neon Strike Kitty:	Mostly I'm just uncomfortable with the dress code.
Kireina:	I'll just sit there reading
Neon Strike Kitty:	Same
Kireina:	I don't like the pool either :/
FLUBS:	beaches are nice, but not for canes or wheelchairs
Kireina:	I'm fine with going to the beach, but you won't catch me in the water >_>
FLUBS:	these days when i go in the pool i just float
Kireina:	Other than the fact that I don't know how to swim, I can't stand being in the water or near it
superheronerd:	I like to swim
FLUBS:	ive never understood competitive swimming. its so calming yet competing ruins that
SquidofBaconator:	I don't even like going in water, too
FLUBS:	not anymore
FLUBS:	that and run
FLUBS:	i used to swim a lot
Dragonite:	am i the only one who doesnt like water
FLUBS:	im bad too
SquidofBaconator:	I'm bad at swimming. I just sink
FLUBS:	dang, it really isnt that hard if you arent like competing. its mostly arm in front of arm while kicking
Kireina:	though...I don't know how to swim >_>
Kireina:	same
FLUBS:	no swimming for this flubs üòê
FLUBS:	course my vacations consist of sitting in a chair looking at the water and reading
FLUBS:	its a good vacation show. watching on planes and in hotels
SquidofBaconator:	If any of you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It's hilarious
FLUBS:	oh that show is funny
SquidofBaconator:	It's my favorite show of all time
SquidofBaconator:	Pretty much, I mostly just watch Impractical Jokers, since barely anything else looks good
Kireina:	Cya Kugal
Kugallyblitz:	bai
SquidofBaconator:	Also, bye Kugal
Kugallyblitz:	I'll see ya later tonight üòõ
FLUBS:	bye kugal!
SquidofBaconator:	The same can be said for regular tv in general
Kugallyblitz:	I gotta go frands
SquidofBaconator:	I haven't found any that look interesting to me
Kireina:	;;
Kugallyblitz:	but either than that i dont watch any
Kugallyblitz:	though chewy and i might watch some together
FLUBS:	me neither, ill watch it if its a good show, but will not go out of my way to search for it like some
superheronerd:	It's not my thing, either
SquidofBaconator:	I haven't watched any in a few months
Kugallyblitz:	none lol
Kugallyblitz:	infact
Kugallyblitz:	I dont watch very much anime ;3;
SquidofBaconator:	Ok I just checked the pinned messages and the last 10 are all from Gummy... üòê
FLUBS:	^
SquidofBaconator:	Like how parents are always dead in anime
FLUBS:	i mean i could go over what happened to me in like less than 2 minutes
superheronerd:	Like unnecessary character deaths
Kugallyblitz:	eh
Kugallyblitz:	maybe getting shot is easier to tell
SquidofBaconator:	People must like the conflict of getting shot
Kugallyblitz:	very true
FLUBS:	hell even just breaking your back is more interesting
superheronerd:	It's shock value, sadly
FLUBS:	having a stroke
FLUBS:	there are so many other options
FLUBS:	like just even mentioning other ways, by birth, genetic condition, a health change
SquidofBaconator:	Cliches
FLUBS:	its just so basic and unexciting
FLUBS:	gunshots are such a boring way to say someone got disabled in movies
SquidofBaconator:	What do you mean Stuck?
Kugallyblitz:	and <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823> baconator
FLUBS:	oh yeah. where we were from before master came in...
Kugallyblitz:	oh wow
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hasn't even read my message.
Neon Strike Kitty:	She's been offline for about an hour.
SquidofBaconator:	Being bored
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm waiting on a response from someone.
Kugallyblitz:	so what are you guys up to
SquidofBaconator:	Can we have a nice discussion over something instead of resorting to violence?
Dragonite:	Let's.
FLUBS:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Alright, since he can't respond anymore, maybe drop the topic?
Neon Strike Kitty:	That escalated quickly
Neon Strike Kitty:	Welp
FLUBS:	you mean the correct one?
SuperGummying:	Stop taking this side
SuperGummying:	Shut up master started
FLUBS:	starvation *rimshot*
SuperGummying:	Dragonite I'm going to say this once
Dragonite:	I'm not in the mood to joke around
Dragonite:	<@199725993416589313> i'm going to say this once and once only: if you truly think communism is funny you have absoluetly zero right to call yourself a history buff
SuperGummying:	Plus I live in Kalos
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're not Napoleon.
SuperGummying:	Ask master
FLUBS:	i made them all even üòÉ
superheronerd:	It isn't
Master9000:	tbh its nto funny
Master9000:	95% is +-2 standard deviations, leaving gummy, The Fool in the statistically significant 5% of outliers
Dragonite:	why are we even joking about that
FLUBS:	no...
SuperGummying:	If this country was communism I would rule it
FLUBS:	is he 5%
Master9000:	i think hes talking about 95% of the population
FLUBS:	guns dont kill people, people defend people from people with smaller guns!
Kugallyblitz:	how is ""everyone nicer up here" gummy if you are there?
Master9000:	its the ultimate system of checks and balances
Master9000:	because then nobody wants to get htemselves killed trying to attack someone protected
FLUBS:	no
SquidofBaconator:	If everyone owned guns, then everyone would be dead üíÄ
FLUBS:	only gun law is everyone must own guns
FLUBS:	gun laws suck
FLUBS:	and gun laws
RC:	and?
SuperGummying:	Also safer gun laws
SquidofBaconator:	We have a gun here, but no ammunition. What's the point then?
FLUBS:	and communism
FLUBS:	yeah but fake country
SuperGummying:	"Free" health care, longer life expectancy, no drama with politics, and we are all nicer up here
Kugallyblitz:	lmao
FLUBS:	though i have not had one
FLUBS:	i own a gun! thats why i love america! that and beer farts
SquidofBaconator:	üá∫üá∏
Master9000:	why you pref that over merica, i cant understand
Master9000:	_pokes communist maple syrup_
SuperGummying:	I can pass U.S. block
FLUBS:	is living in a fake country worth it?
SuperGummying:	That's why I'm in Canada
SuperGummying:	Ha
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
FLUBS:	this video is no longer available, sorry about that!
SquidofBaconator:	I don't want to watch Arthur...
FLUBS:	but only for gummy
Kireina:	If only.
FLUBS:	huh
FLUBS:	is mentioning banning bannable?
Kireina:	Like paying you off or something
SuperGummying:	Watch this then
SuperGummying:	Squid
Kireina:	Although, we'd probably find a reason to ban gummy somehow w/ that
FLUBS:	im saying you suck
Master9000:	~~its a circlejerk~~
FLUBS:	its by me and the oppisite
SquidofBaconator:	You're "Not" going to get banned?
Kireina:	^
FLUBS:	it isnt self promotion gummy
SuperGummying:	Stop stuck
SuperGummying:	I'm not going to get ban for that
Master9000:	that one i dont recall
SuperGummying:	HEY
FLUBS:	/s
FLUBS:	watch gummy's videos!
SuperGummying:	Didn't Dragonite propose to surrendering the provoking game
SquidofBaconator:	Great, there's nothing to watch on YouTube right now... üòî
Master9000:	many a time
SuperGummying:	That's codeword
SuperGummying:	Yes stuck
Master9000:	its relevant
Dragonite:	didn't gummy propose that he was going to, like, behave himself at some point in time?
FLUBS:	you mean arthur?
Master9000:	sauce https://youtu.be/Vy_Dj_YSEsE?t=3m42s
SuperGummying:	_goes back into watching the poker game _
SuperGummying:	Bleh that's boring
FLUBS:	though a text channel for vc...
FLUBS:	i guess
Master9000:	~~upgrade provided to you by the sellout corporation~~
Master9000:	we do have <#311478529797914626> and Kajar as a second channel tho
FLUBS:	yeah i think a text for the vc is good, i could make good use
Kireina:	Have fun.
SquidofBaconator:	You know, I think I'll just go watch YouTube now. I don't really have anything left to say.
Kireina:	One being for the voice channels? I agree ü§î
Master9000:	what happened to you not spamming?
SuperGummying:	Ooooh more gum gum spammy
FLUBS:	i mean vc is a thing
Master9000:	true, ~~we may need to make a second general~~
FLUBS:	im being talked about too
superheronerd:	I am also doing hw. Unfortunately
FLUBS:	and me
Kireina:	We're also talking about movies >_>
Kireina:	Cartoon's aren't an anime :^|
FLUBS:	it isnt creative a meme a game nor an anime
SuperGummying:	Don't ban gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well, it's two general conversations.
SuperGummying:	No Ida
FLUBS:	well we cant use them....
Master9000:	you mean all
Kireina:	I mean everyone, but Squid.
Kireina:	and by most of us
Master9000:	_looks at all the channels not in use_
Kireina:	Most of us are ignoring gummy.
FLUBS:	there are, master
SquidofBaconator:	There is
FLUBS:	i do not agree gummy
Master9000:	i feel like therse two conversations happening at once here
Neon Strike Kitty:	*bans Gummy for posting TTG*
SuperGummying:	https://youtu.be/Jl-lfkISXOI
SuperGummying:	Though this is funny
Kireina:	First Class iirc
SuperGummying:	True true
FLUBS:	thats still so boring though
Kireina:	in one of the X-Men origin movies
superheronerd:	I think in the movies it's a gunshot
SquidofBaconator:	It always had its problems, Gummy; I was just saying that TTG has a bad influence on the CURRENT state of the channel
Kireina:	he also may have gotten shot in the lower back
Kireina:	but now that I'm thinking about it more
Kireina:	I'd have to research more on it
FLUBS:	like how ***i*** got like this is more exciting than that
Kireina:	I mean that's the tl;dr
FLUBS:	that is so goddamn boring
SuperGummying:	God damn you two look the same
SuperGummying:	I mean squid
Kireina:	iirc, a giant stone was dropped onto his legs.
SuperGummying:	Stuck since when was Cartoon Network great?
Kireina:	mm
FLUBS:	yay
Mee6:	<@!214587785510780929>, you just advanced to **level 28** !
superheronerd:	Ah gotcha
FLUBS:	i dont really. how did he get disabled?
SquidofBaconator:	TTG is stupid and its success has a terrible influence on CN
Kireina:	Also, <@!214587785510780929> I was mainly telling Flubs about Prof. Xavier and how he may or may not relate to him :^)
SuperGummying:	Same however I like two episodes of the new one
SquidofBaconator:	Teen Titans was great; old one
FLUBS:	good. old one was good.
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Kireina: SKITTY the new one`
SuperGummying:	Teen Titans go
Kireina:	Old one
FLUBS:	the new one or the old one panda?
SuperGummying:	Though there is one cartoon that we never talk about
Kireina:	Oh and Teen Titans
Kireina:	though Dragonball/Inuyasha always stuck with me
superheronerd:	Ed edd n eddy was glorious
SuperGummying:	I love cartoons
FLUBS:	and now i dont even have a tv in my apt
SquidofBaconator:	It's why I review it on YouTube
Kireina:	I kinda skimmed around a lot
SquidofBaconator:	I still love animation
SquidofBaconator:	I watched a LOT of Spongebob and Ed Edd n Eddy
FLUBS:	i was never into cartoons
Kireina:	I was more of a Hey Arnold kinda guy
SuperGummying:	The cartoon squid
FLUBS:	yes
SquidofBaconator:	The PBS show?
SquidofBaconator:	Arthur?
Kireina:	I'll send you a link if I remember/find what they were
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`FLUBS: and i almost SKITTYing punched the guy`
SuperGummying:	I need help with my addiction
FLUBS:	ive had people sit IN it.
SuperGummying:	Arthur I can't stop watching it
FLUBS:	that sounds cool!
Kireina:	so i'm considering that option
FLUBS:	shoving that toy car up your ass?
Kireina:	Although, apparrently there are like 3d attachable lenses
SquidofBaconator:	I sit behind the handicap spot at my theater. Plenty of leg room
FLUBS:	to?
SuperGummying:	Stuck im addicted
Kireina:	3d glasses are a pain in the ass
SquidofBaconator:	One a year for me too
FLUBS:	i *used* to sit in the front
Kireina:	I feel you on that one Flubs q_q
superheronerd:	Oh no I missed discussion of Logan
Kireina:	Won't kill my ears
FLUBS:	my vision sucks, so i wear glasses. 3d movies cant happen then üòê
SquidofBaconator:	The Emoji Movie? üòêüòÇ
Kireina:	Not as loud in the back
FLUBS:	im closer to one a year.
Kireina:	Also, I really enjoy sitting in the back ono
FLUBS:	i regret nothing
Kireina:	I don't watch very much either, but usually I see a movie once a month or something
SquidofBaconator:	I prefer tv and YouTube
FLUBS:	my last 3 were the two star wars and the emoji movie
SquidofBaconator:	The last 3 movies I saw in theaters are Cars 3 and the last 2 Star Wars films
FLUBS:	~~i usually have to sit in the back~~
FLUBS:	im not a movie person
Kireina:	Which makes me sad q_q
Kireina:	Yeah apparently a lot of you people haven't seen a lot of movies :/
FLUBS:	patrick stewart in the xmen films. he plays the poop emoji in the emoji movie
SquidofBaconator:	üòõ
SquidofBaconator:	Oh. I never saw that either
Kireina:	I'm mainly referring to the movie Logan
Kireina:	Although, in this instance of Xavier
SquidofBaconator:	Who's Xavier?
FLUBS:	ah
Kireina:	Xavier
FLUBS:	wait how insane who gets?
FLUBS:	yes. they make skitty people's mother
SquidofBaconator:	So our Skitty is a mother now? Lol
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Kireina: "i wanna see how insane this motherSKITTYer gets"`
Kireina:	LOL
FLUBS:	Me neither, though i guess i may be interested if i relate to someone a bit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Kireina:	Was mainly referring to Flubs, but I mean I guess it applies to everyone else too.
SquidofBaconator:	I prefer comedies
SquidofBaconator:	I'm not much of an action movie person
Kireina:	Anyways, if you haven't seen the X-Men movies before. I'd highly suggest watching them, really well done.
FLUBS:	Hello, Squid
Kugallyblitz:	wb baconator also glad to see ya
Kireina:	Wb, Squid.
SquidofBaconator:	I'm back. Again.
FLUBS:	i have the first part
Kireina:	w/ a shred of random clairvoyance here and there
Kireina:	He also may or may not be mentally insane at that point
FLUBS:	well i mean with time...
Kireina:	so he has to be constantly drugged >_>
Kireina:	Anyways, at least you're able to use parts of your bodies later on Prof. Xavier can't move on his own and can't control his psyhic powers, which causes major tremors around him.
FLUBS:	i like how i literally did not notice what i was saying there
Kugallyblitz:	pretty much <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
FLUBS:	alright gummy, to the mentally disabled
Kireina:	aaaaaaaaand ignoring gummy again.
FLUBS:	im stupid lol

SuperGummying:	_shoots stuck again _
Kireina:	...
FLUBS:	wait

SuperGummying:	I am a super hero
FLUBS:	nope.
FLUBS:	*thinks of moving a plant*
FLUBS:	maybe i do have superpowers...
Kireina:	and yes, yes those are broken.
Kireina:	unless ofcourse it's actually the dumbest decision possible, but you know... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
FLUBS:	those are broken as hell lol
FLUBS:	(√≥ √¨_√≠)=√≥ (√≥ √¨_√≠)=√≥ (√≥ √¨_√≠)=√≥ (√≥ √¨_√≠)=√≥ (√≥ √¨_√≠)=√≥
Kireina:	Nothing wrong w/ trying though.
Kireina:	Highly doubt you'll succeed >_>
Kireina:	Feel free to try
FLUBS:	you can be my punching bag (‡∏á Õ†¬∞ ÕüŸÑÕú Õ°¬∞)‡∏á

FLUBS:	gummy, nobody said ida would be the one smacking you.
FLUBS:	home! you know what is great about walking? your hands are completely free
Dragonite:	dont you just hate it when that happens
SuperGummying:	Oh like ida is going to reach through the screen and smack me
Dragonite:	i have one in the basement but i dont know if it still works or not
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't have a working VCR anymore.
FLUBS:	*waiting at red light intensifies*
Dragonite:	squash and stretch, mateys, squash and stretch
FLUBS:	You get smacked until you wake up. Said it yourself
SuperGummying:	So Ida what happens if I fall asleep during the movie?
Dragonite:	4. enjoy the slightly deteriorated 360p video quality
Dragonite:	3. push the speed button until the previews are finished (since there is no Skip button)
Dragonite:	step 2. poke it and prod it until the machine recognizes the tape has been inserted
Dragonite:	step 1. stick the VHS casette into the VCR
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes, Gummy
Master9000:	http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/i/2192344581 finally got a chance to test wifi on mobile at home

FLUBS:	Yay now I get to spend a half hour rolling down the sidewalk. See you at the end of my adventure.
SuperGummying:	Does this mean I have to watch the sequel as well Ida?
SuperGummying:	Wait
SuperGummying:	Ida don't worry I know how to find movies
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've used it before to watch Kara no Kyoukai
SuperGummying:	What could go wrong?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just don't know how I could find the movie
SuperGummying:	I'll figure it out show ida and play the movie
SuperGummying:	No I won't
Deino Mite:	gummy could find a way to mess up
SuperGummying:	I mean I could set it up
SuperGummying:	No
Master9000:	There's no room to go wrong
Master9000:	Yeah you just pick it up and pet it
SuperGummying:	I know how to use rabbit
Kireina:	not insanely difficult, pretty self explanatory once take a glance.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well, I don't know how to use it.

FLUBS:	I'm gonna go to the supermarket and buy a single piece of fruit. Then make people wait behind me while I return it.
FLUBS:	I thought I was 19 but I guess I'm 85
FLUBS:	I'm bald, in a wheelchair, and I just napped in the park.
SuperDragonite2172:	It's not meant to be a rip-off.
SuperDragonite2172:	A bit of the first and third.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Or paying an homage to.
Neon Strike Kitty:	This really looks like it's either inspired by or ripping off.
FLUBS:	God I'm an old person now
SuperDragonite2172:	
SuperDragonite2172:	If need be, I can post a picture to reduce confusion.
Dragonite:	Brb e!dragoniteing for a bit

Kireina:	Cannot say I have heard of it either
SuperDragonite2172:	Alright.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Nah, I'm good.
SuperDragonite2172:	If you all want to try it, I can link the download.

SuperGummying:	Fine I'll give him the lecture
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's not quite that simple
SuperGummying:	_slaps pimaster _
Deino Mite:	or you could stop being dumb that way there is no reason to bully you
SuperGummying:	Or well Ida you could teach stuck as well
SuperGummying:	And how bad it is
SuperGummying:	He shall teach stuck about bullying
SuperGummying:	So bunni isn't here and regal got punch somehow so I summon Arthur
SuperGummying:	And I'm just crazy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got so many internet personas and mix them all together
SuperGummying:	This Arthur
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	That could work as well
SuperGummying:	....
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~'s my dad~~
Neon Strike Kitty:	The one in the white shirt
Neon Strike Kitty:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	I thought of this Arthur
SuperGummying:	He's the main character
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh
FLUBS:	ill be on and off folks
SuperGummying:	And Arthur is a cartoon I was watching yesterday
FLUBS:	*rolls out the door with dogs*

SuperGummying:	Ida bunni had been busy and stuff
FLUBS:	what are you gonna do? teach me about bullying?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Who's Arthur?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I haven't seen bunni around for ages
SuperGummying:	_calls Arthur _
FLUBS:	*blocks the door*
SuperGummying:	_calls bunni _

SuperGummying:	I'm not stupid
SuperGummying:	I know they aren't born with collars
FLUBS:	/r/notmyjob
Master9000:	That didn't help, now it's at 9%
FLUBS:	/r/chargeyourphone
Master9000:	Ok good, mobile is being a piece of shit and I'm at 10% <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>

FLUBS:	welp
SuperGummying:	It got killed apparently
SuperGummying:	Longest interaction with it though
SuperGummying:	Well I found a cat once couldn't take it in
superheronerd:	Also when the names match
FLUBS:	*noms paper*
SuperGummying:	_writes it down _
SuperGummying:	So cats do wear collars
FLUBS:	i see what you mean
FLUBS:	ohhhh
FLUBS:	especially when their names match! "benjamin and penelope"
superheronerd:	Model status
SuperGummying:	That's how you pronounce it right?
Master9000:	
SuperGummying:	Kat ia
SuperGummying:	Katia hmmm
superheronerd:	Pets are so cute
Master9000:	Also here's one of her with a collar becaus gummys an idiot
Master9000:	Katia
FLUBS:	master, what is kitty's name?
FLUBS:	mine are indoor dogs because they are 8 pounds and hawks are in the area
FLUBS:	thats smart
Master9000:	Our car has one because she likes to go outside
FLUBS:	nor does penny
FLUBS:	benny has no collar either
Master9000:	Sounds like a you problem
SuperGummying:	_pokes cat _
SuperGummying:	I see no collar
SuperDragonite2172:	Kitty. ^w^
FLUBS:	kitty!
Master9000:	Here's one I managed to get of her
FLUBS:	I think this is her. Can't really tell though. Also at my dads.
Master9000:	Ok for me it's more like "impossible to make a photo that looks half decent" so yeah a bit like that
FLUBS:	theres an example
FLUBS:	
FLUBS:	exactly. penny is like valk from rainbow six, good looking, but the second a camera comes out they turn into satan
Master9000:	Hates cameras, only acts cute when there's none of them around
FLUBS:	benny is very nippy
Master9000:	Sounds like my cat
FLUBS:	penny is cuter
FLUBS:	nah i wont violate her privacy
superheronerd:	Gotcha. Sounds just as cute
SuperGummying:	and take a pic
SuperGummying:	just make sure penny isn't looking
FLUBS:	also female
FLUBS:	penny doesnt let me take pictures, imagine benny but a little smaller, no back right leg, and a brown stripe down his back
Dragonite:	_chops off gummy's fingers_
SuperGummying:	_pokes pokes pokes pokes_
Master9000:	You didn't :P
FLUBS:	he is!
superheronerd:	he is adorable
SuperGummying:	_pokes dog_
Master9000:	
Master9000:	You had plenty of time to claim it
FLUBS:	That is more than a forearm I know
superheronerd:	AAAAAH
SuperGummying:	i hate that link
FLUBS:	This is him at my dads
SuperGummying:	okay
SuperGummying:	ha
SuperGummying:	ha
superheronerd:	That'll do it then
Master9000:	Ok cool
FLUBS:	and is around the length of my forearm
Dragonite:	it links to "traitor"
FLUBS:	He weighs 8 pounds
Master9000:	I can't tell on mobile
Neon Strike Kitty:	If I have muskets.
superheronerd:	How big is benny for him to do that?
Master9000:	What does that link to?
Master9000:	https://bit.ly/supergummying
FLUBS:	what did you forget?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I forgot
FLUBS:	im having trouble getting back in my chair now üòê why you do this benny
FLUBS:	ugh
SuperGummying:	poland's national anthem mentions napoleon
FLUBS:	spanish food?
SuperGummying:	you know what i like
FLUBS:	hes annoying, but hes playing
SuperGummying:	heh heh heh
SuperGummying:	whoops
SuperGummying:	oh
FLUBS:	hes playing
FLUBS:	no!
SuperGummying:	bad
SuperGummying:	_slaps benny_
FLUBS:	benny just pulled my chair back and i fell out
SuperGummying:	_sings poland is not yet lost_
FLUBS:	shit lol
SuperGummying:	im pretty sure you do since you are in the renaissance era
FLUBS:	so be ww2 poland
SuperGummying:	you do have muskets right?
SuperGummying:	wait ida
SuperGummying:	like swords
SuperGummying:	i have knight weapons
SuperGummying:	she has muskets
Neon Strike Kitty:	I somehow managed to lose in science to one of the NPC civs
Master9000:	You're playing with sticks and stones while she already has fighter planes, ICBMs, and carriers
FLUBS:	what do you want me to do? speak?
SuperGummying:	real plan is provoke ida enough so she will attack me
Master9000:	Because you're doomed regardless
SuperGummying:	why are we talking about this when ida can see all of this?
FLUBS:	but you need to really focus it
SuperGummying:	i just have one question
SuperGummying:	then i can get ahead of ida
SuperGummying:	science
SuperGummying:	yeah'
FLUBS:	wow. he is right you know.
SuperGummying:	he said science
SuperGummying:	science
SuperGummying:	hey i took stuck's advice
FLUBS:	i mean ive only been here for like a month so he still gets some hope
SuperDragonite2172:	Then it's no wonder why you've given up.
Master9000:	Yeah I gave him quite a few months and couldn't even leave a dent
FLUBS:	~~especially in narrow hallways~~
SuperDragonite2172:	Good on you, Stuck.
FLUBS:	because people need to be patient with me
FLUBS:	i try to be patient with people
Master9000:	See this is why I stopped trying with him
FLUBS:	no.
SuperGummying:	i need help with napoleon tactics
FLUBS:	THEN WHY ASK FOR HELP
SuperGummying:	im using napoleon tactics
SuperGummying:	besides
FLUBS:	~~tell that to the jews~~
SuperGummying:	all he was, was a leader
SuperGummying:	he didn't do shit
FLUBS:	you dont almost conquer europe based on hope
SuperGummying:	his generals did everything for him
FLUBS:	just because he did bad things does not make him a bad strategist
SuperGummying:	im not using what hitler did
SuperGummying:	you called it the hitler strategy
SuperGummying:	and stuck
SuperGummying:	then focus on one side
SuperGummying:	you beat the other side first
FLUBS:	>gummy asks for help
>i give it
>he says nah
SuperGummying:	it was like the schlieffen plan for germany in ww1
SuperGummying:	i would have used the gumlin plan
SuperGummying:	nah
FLUBS:	the hitler strategy
FLUBS:	push up against your enemy, get great generals to put citadels and steal their territory, then wedge into them and split them in half and fight both sides
SuperGummying:	just incase ida does attack
SuperGummying:	buffer zones and the scorched earth policy
FLUBS:	what is it
SuperGummying:	my strategy isn't working
FLUBS:	youll get better fast
SuperGummying:	also even worst
FLUBS:	turn on tips
FLUBS:	with like 4 other bots
FLUBS:	do the freeplay in singleplayer
FLUBS:	thatll help you get better
SuperGummying:	they were boring
FLUBS:	maybe play some tutorials
SuperGummying:	so i can't attack her yet
SuperGummying:	ida has been helping me
FLUBS:	that explains it
FLUBS:	ah
SuperGummying:	first game ever
FLUBS:	have you played civ?
SuperGummying:	one of them is puppet
FLUBS:	or improve tiles
SuperGummying:	well 3
SuperGummying:	i have 4 cities
FLUBS:	use buildings
SuperGummying:	idk how to produce gold btw
FLUBS:	so either produce it or stop spending it
SuperGummying:	im at a -8
SuperGummying:	ida had to give me some
SuperGummying:	like badly
SuperGummying:	im losing gold
SuperGummying:	also
FLUBS:	so i dont know, focus science and get the diplomatic ending
FLUBS:	god gummy
SuperGummying:	ida and the two ai players have theirs set to prince
SuperGummying:	i didn't know
SuperGummying:	i set it to that
SuperGummying:	since napoleon was an emperor
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`FLUBS: you are a SKITTYing idiot`
SuperGummying:	because i thought it was a title
SuperGummying:	i set it to emperor
SuperGummying:	my difficult setting
SuperGummying:	also i have another problem
FLUBS:	...why am i not surprised
SuperGummying:	napoleon
FLUBS:	who are you playing as?

SuperGummying:	warhammer 2 is coming out
FLUBS:	talking about my dogs
FLUBS:	you know what wont go over my head?
FLUBS:	all of this is going right over my head
SuperGummying:	i think thats part of rome or medieval total war
SuperGummying:	she would pick vikings
SuperGummying:	honestly knowing ida
FLUBS:	that did not answer my question
SuperGummying:	it's the name of the game
FLUBS:	what is the difference between a normal hammer and a war hammer?
SuperGummying:	warhammer being a fantasy type of game
SuperGummying:	attila total war and warhammer
SuperGummying:	since they were new
SuperGummying:	two games were not part of the package
SuperGummying:	however

FLUBS:	its cute you think you could though...
SuperGummying:	doesn't have to be napoleon
SuperGummying:	actaully i would let her choose the total war game
FLUBS:	no....
SuperGummying:	i would beat ida
SuperGummying:	i hate emulate
FLUBS:	you would still lose
SuperGummying:	me vs you in napoleon total war?
FLUBS:	well maybe emulate? its a pain to do but you still could

FLUBS:	i dont forget it for the same reason. but im always reading on it so i say that doesnt count
SuperGummying:	for me the only i don't forget is because when im not my pc im always on my phone which may be a problem
SuperGummying:	well...i mean it shows you aren't addicted to your phone which is good
FLUBS:	ive lost my boat keys like that üòê

FLUBS:	ah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got a tendency to break or lose my phones.
FLUBS:	why? im kind of lost here...
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd probably get annoyed and break it
SuperGummying:	though it would be interesting watching you use a smartphone ida
SuperGummying:	i think they do have it
SuperGummying:	i think so
FLUBS:	#americaistheonlyrealcountry

Neon Strike Kitty:	I want one
Neon Strike Kitty:	But the hoodie is cool
FLUBS:	huh
Master9000:	No

SuperDragonite2172:	That typo tho. <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm reading Fate/Hollow Ataraxia

SuperGummying:	_is currently on the floor in pain_
Master9000:	While at the same time also not listening to us nonetheless
Dragonite:	it's our fault because we let him type in chat
SuperDragonite2172:	Seriously?
SuperDragonite2172:	You expect us to be responsible for your actions, Cirno?
FLUBS:	‡ºº òÃöŸÑÕú òÃö‡ºΩ

Kireina:	The only person you can ever blame is yourself.
SuperDragonite2172:	How typical of you, Cirno.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've left it for long enough.
Dragonite:	what ya' reading?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Welp, back to my visual novel.
SuperGummying:	i blame dragonite
Master9000:	<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
Dragonite:	except i would probably make it exclusive to gummy
Kireina:	Because you only told us about it after the fact.
Dragonite:	<@!162952008712716288> now tempted to make a bot reaction for the word "butt"
SuperGummying:	why didn't someone tell me not to get on that thing?

FLUBS:	(Õ° Õ°¬∞ Õú „Å§ Õ°Õ°¬∞)

SuperGummying:	who's bright idea was it to get on that thing?
Kireina:	Like 98/99
Dragonite:	"not low enough"
RC:	so what's his purity score now?
SuperDragonite2172:	*shot*
SuperDragonite2172:	It's just the butts isn't it, Cirno.

Master9000:	Hence the age implementation I thought of earlier
SuperGummying:	it's still 100
Kireina:	I don't think one's purity score can go up...only down
SuperGummying:	nope
FLUBS:	‚öÜ _ ‚öÜ master
FLUBS:	down
Master9000:	Is "in a car" one of the test marks? Wait nvm the car was in him <:LUL:305559915714576385>

Neon Strike Kitty:	Did it go up?

SuperGummying:	Ninnies
SuperGummying:	Not that type of toy
SuperGummying:	
Kireina:	indeed
Master9000:	Same
Dragonite:	i have a few responses to that but none of them are particularly safe for work
SuperGummying:	Wait for it
FLUBS:	am i the only one thinking bad things about that here?
FLUBS:	uhhh
SuperGummying:	And I hurt my butt with it
FLUBS:	oh god
SuperGummying:	I found my childhood toy
FLUBS:	...no
SuperGummying:	wanna know how?
FLUBS:	though if it was, i would have won
SuperGummying:	i hurt it
SuperGummying:	dude im not joking
FLUBS:	i have not had feeling in mine for 3 years. not that its a contest
Dragonite:

Master9000:	Let's not go there
FLUBS:	just telling a story from my youth
FLUBS:	i im not bragging
FLUBS:	it was really funny
Dragonite:	or in flubs case, bragging about beheading cats
FLUBS:	not murder?
Master9000:	Illegal means stuff like giving away illegal product keys or promoting sub bots
Dragonite:	_flings the banhammer at gummy's face_
Dragonite:	_starts polishing the banhammer_
FLUBS:	oh fuff
SuperGummying:	Like illegal stuff?
SuperGummying:	Isn't this dark?
FLUBS:	~~i mean if and when i murder my father...~~
FLUBS:	he kinda gets first dibs
SuperDragonite2172:	I wonder if anybody else is going to become a money fountain for Eyan.
FLUBS:	or be eyan
Dragonite:	100% easiest way to get first call on any pok√©mon in a draft: be candyman
FLUBS:	well if i donate that much he might just let me take it
Master9000:	This is assuming he does another draft at all btw
FLUBS:	sooo
FLUBS:	life savings of both my parents
FLUBS:	gummy i think mine is more
SuperGummying:	I'll take the sylveon
SuperGummying:	_donates his European trip money _
Master9000:	Did you mean he ***will*** glare anyone down
FLUBS:	one sylveon please!
FLUBS:	*donates all to eyan*
FLUBS:	*kills parents for inheritence*
RC:	yeah, like that would happen
Dragonite:	(ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)
Dragonite:	deci arguably has absol reserved because he can glare everyone else down
SuperGummying:	More than candyman
SuperGummying:	All I do is pay him
SuperGummying:	Nah master
Master9000:	Nobody has anything reserved, if Eyan does another draft, gummy doesn't Get sylveon priority just because he fanboys it :P
Animal_Man_:	YOU FRICKING FRICKS
FLUBS:	dont curse, animal man
Animal_Man_:	frick no
FLUBS:	ill take it if i get the profile pic too
SuperGummying:	So if I change my favourite Pokemon will you take sylveon?
Animal_Man_:	Just watch some of my old pokemon videos
Animal_Man_:	YES.
SuperGummying:	Are you sure animal man?
FLUBS:	its great
FLUBS:	with them pulling me
FLUBS:	but it works more like a throne
FLUBS:	i promised my dogs id ~~walk~~ them in the park later today
FLUBS:	jeez i could go for sleep but cant
Master9000:	_falls asleep for other reasons_
FLUBS:	*but it failed!*
SuperDragonite2172:	*uses Yawn*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*yawns self to death*
FLUBS:	unless we rule out leg based actions i am gonna lose
Danieru:	"oh great composure"
FLUBS:	i mean b/c of that i hit a limit before others
Danieru:	are we now going to have a tournament for the most dramatic yawn?
FLUBS:	id stretch my legs too but...ya know...
Animal_Man_:	Gummy I've always loved poison types in general
Master9000:	Exaggerate thenloudness a^
FLUBS:	very long and drawn out, stretching my arms a bit maybe
Mee6:	<@305267880935555072>, you just advanced to **level 2** !
Danieru:	hang on, how do you yawn dramatically?
FLUBS:	SPEAK WHEN SPOKEN TO, MAGGOT!
FLUBS:	*punches gummy in the mouth*
SuperGummying:	What is this?
SuperGummying:	Animal man stealing my former favourite Pokemon
FLUBS:	*yawns dramatically*
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Dragonite:	Besides when I do it's probably going to be a probability of happening
Master9000:	~~should've drafted slowpoke instead~~
Animal_Man_:	I love my cough drops
Animal_Man_:	Weezing is one of my favs
Dragonite:	I haven't actually done it yet, master
Animal_Man_:	dang man
Animal_Man_:	XD
FLUBS:	and i hate it
FLUBS:	it still sucks
Master9000:	¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø also testing PUN
FLUBS:	koffing/weezing - coughdrops
Animal_Man_:	It's not a pun
Dragonite:	Cough drops?
Animal_Man_:	What, why?
FLUBS:	animal man, i saw the name you gave your poke in the draft. i hate you.
Master9000:	Since some Pok√©mon split up into two forms
Master9000:	First and last stage
Animal_Man_:	gg
Dragonite:	brb doing that
Animal_Man_:	aka me?
Danieru:	any reason why on the draft list there is only machop and machamp instead of the full evolution line or can you just not fit it in
Master9000:	Have it do the disturbed face and not delete it
Dragonite:	only people who write PUNishment (sic)
FLUBS:	wouldnt that only ban the word pun?
Animal_Man_:	lol
Dragonite:	<@162952008712716288> should I add "PUN" in capital letters to the list of banned words or something
FLUBS:	that works too
FLUBS:	or just dont make any
Animal_Man_:	yeah I can't do that
Dragonite:	If you're going to make a pun at least make an original one
Master9000:	I prefer banishing those who make puns
Animal_Man_:	XD
FLUBS:	get. out.
Animal_Man_:	are you saying we should PUNish the puns?
Master9000:	That's what he wants you to think
Animal_Man_:	lol
FLUBS:	puns are bad
FLUBS:	good.
Animal_Man_:	It actually wasn't a pun XD
Animal_Man_:	lol
Master9000:	Same and also we just drove 20 minutes to some church for no reason...
FLUBS:	*cant tell if its a pun*
Animal_Man_:	*gives stuck a board game*
FLUBS:	im bored. someone give me something to do
Animal_Man_:	XD
FLUBS:	ehhhhh

Master9000:	
Danieru:	Nah, his favourite must be, as shown by the username, skitty
FLUBS:	dragonite, lemme guess. your favorite is....dragoniar?
SuperDragonite2172:	He's in the Hoenn Dex.
FLUBS:	he isnt iirc
Animal_Man_:	My fav is Metagross, and I don't think he's in that pokedex
SuperDragonite2172:	Oh well.
SuperDragonite2172:	I didn't get mine, but it wasn't an option.
FLUBS:	i got my favorite too!
FLUBS:	eh im close enough that "walking" is fast enough
Animal_Man_:	nice
Danieru:	lol so happy i got machop on the draft, machamp is my favourite pokemon üòÑ
Master9000:	Yeah I mean you can just drive the boat to downtown lmao
FLUBS:	nice and hilly
FLUBS:	so flooding is fine

FLUBS:	üòÑ
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ping below 100 and download went to 3 MBps
Neon Strike Kitty:	Just did another check and it's significantly better than it was then
FLUBS:	huh.
SuperDragonite2172:	Wonder if a hot-spot would work better.
Neon Strike Kitty:	since it failed to connect for the first two
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think that check was the third try or something
Neon Strike Kitty:	Old speed check:
FLUBS:	that is horrible
FLUBS:	jesus
Neon Strike Kitty:	Comcast would probably be an improvement.
FLUBS:	because that sounds like something comcast would be
FLUBS:	comcast?
Neon Strike Kitty:	My area has one provider that doesn't have good service and extorts the hell out of us
FLUBS:	my area has so many good providers so theyre all pretty cheap and fast
SuperGummying:	That explains why you didn't respond
FLUBS:	that is the only thing i have going for me
SuperGummying:	Oh hey Ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	My internet's decided that it doesn't like working.
SuperGummying:	But they are so addicting
SuperGummying:	Man I gotta stop watching these history videos

FLUBS:	its in my backpack, like half of my meds i put in through an iv
SquidofBaconator:	Wait, why do you have a used syringe lying around? üòê
FLUBS:	i dont think i have anything he can get but it isnt a safe practice...
FLUBS:	yeah but he ate a used syringe...
SquidofBaconator:	So, I guess all that stuff from the pharmacy didn't kill him...
FLUBS:	gummy just ate a syringe...
SuperGummying:	_noms _
FLUBS:	or i could become stronger than ever
FLUBS:	i mean i might just die
FLUBS:	i dont even think half of the things i take would do anything if i ate them
Animal_Man_:	gg
FLUBS:	o.O
SquidofBaconator:	And then Gummy dies from severe drug overdosing after nomming all the drugs...
FLUBS:	it sucks but i need it!
FLUBS:	nooo
SuperGummying:	_noms pharmacy _
FLUBS:	they
FLUBS:	tey take their time

FLUBS:	he said "flubs, that sucks dude. ill write it up."
FLUBS:	Well i said "*doctors name*, i fell for 15 minutes, i need *med i just got off* back."
SuperGummying:	That was less than 15 minutes

FLUBS:	ok ill be back in a few lol
FLUBS:	*locks door*
FLUBS:	*signs in then rolls into room*
SuperGummying:	_walks into the hospital _
FLUBS:	*gummy hits a civilian*
FLUBS:	*rolls into hospital and dodges bullet*
SuperGummying:	_shoots stuck _
SuperGummying:	It's still adorable though
SuperGummying:	Look at the picture it's happy now sad
FLUBS:	that looks funny
FLUBS:	ahahahhaha
SuperGummying:	Now imagine sylveon sad
SuperGummying:	No
FLUBS:	*slashes more ribbons*
SuperGummying:	_starts to bleed _
superheronerd:	For both things said
SuperGummying:	Hey those ribbons are made out of flesh
superheronerd:	Alright, that's pretty fair
FLUBS:	bella, pancakes *are* better with syrup, but i do get the appeal of no syrup.
Master9000:	i dont eat syrup on anything
Master9000:	_cuts off all the rubbons_
superheronerd:	Guys, do you think it's strange that I don't eat pancakes with syrup
FLUBS:	*is now out of ribbon reach*
FLUBS:	*rolls across the street*
SuperGummying:	_uses other ribbons and pulls stuck back _
FLUBS:	thank you master

FLUBS:	*sucker punches gummy then rolls out the door*
SuperGummying:	We can fight later
SuperGummying:	Good luck stuck
FLUBS:	it will, it helps give me a little extra strength in my legs, but it makes my psoriasis flare up. gross, but true.
superheronerd:	Hope that it helps you
FLUBS:	eh i already know what's gonna happen, so itll be fast. im getting back on the injection i got off yesterday, and gonna have a not so swell time with it.
superheronerd:	Best of luck with that, stuck
SuperGummying:	I had fun once you reminded me
SuperGummying:	Well it was fun though ida
FLUBS:	I gotta head out in about 15 mins, but i live close to the hospital so at most I'll be gone for a half hour.
superheronerd:	When will that be happening?
FLUBS:	I gotta go back to the hospital today. And my friend isnt even working today so mehhh
superheronerd:	Ah, gotcha. Hope that goes well
Master9000:	its called being used to being around you
SuperDragonite2172:	I'm not sure right now.  Mainly because there's still more material that will be covered before the final.
superheronerd:	Hey stuck!
FLUBS:	Hello, Bella.
SuperGummying:	And the reason why I want you dead is because you can read through my lies
superheronerd:	How are you feeling about yours?
SuperDragonite2172:	I have one of those coming up in a while myself.
SuperGummying:	I never can kill you
superheronerd:	Which is veeeery soon
SuperGummying:	Ah well
superheronerd:	Things are alright. Studying for my math final
SuperDragonite2172:	How goes things?
superheronerd:	Hello dragonite üòÅ
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Bella.
superheronerd:	Top of the morning to you nerds
Neon Strike Kitty:	You weren't.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wouldn't believe you were the godfather twice in a row.
SuperGummying:	I kinda found it funny how you wouldn't believe I was mafia twice
SuperGummying:	Though there were way too many mistakes I made during that game
SuperGummying:	I mean it may have worked
FLUBS:	im a fan
SuperDragonite2172:	Nope.
Master9000:	do you see a problem with it being pinned?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't see the point of having that pinned.
SuperDragonite2172:	üëå
FLUBS:	thanks master
SuperDragonite2172:	Pffft!
Master9000:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	It wouldn't have worked anyways.
FLUBS:	ok without context
SuperGummying:	Since we were trying to get him lynched
SuperGummying:	Well he did and that kinda cost us
Neon Strike Kitty:	I did not expect him to make a mistake like that lol.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah
SuperGummying:	Foo screwed us up by talking when I silence him
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was trying to find the roleblocker, thought Kodachrome was more likely to be it.
SuperGummying:	We almost won though
FLUBS:	did not know that is possible
FLUBS:	ok day is getting a little better...just got 10 crits in a row in xcom 2
Neon Strike Kitty:	I felt like we had other priorities.
SuperGummying:	Though you never really accused me until the very end
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's kind of like Town of Salem but much more complex and interesting.
SuperDragonite2172:	Never heard of that.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Forum mafia.
SuperGummying:	Oh I saw that
Neon Strike Kitty:	No
SuperDragonite2172:	You two talking about Town of Salem?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, it's because I was the cop.
SuperDragonite2172:	Doing well.
FLUBS:	Horrible! How are you?
SuperDragonite2172:	How is everyone?
FLUBS:	Hello, Dragonite.
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, everyone.
SuperGummying:	How?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I actually knew for a fact that you were mafia from night 3.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah
SuperGummying:	But I tried
SuperGummying:	I screwed then up on day 2 though for being afk
SuperGummying:	That was fun though
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well, that may be true
FLUBS:	^
SuperGummying:	Well Ida like I said we should have killed him at day 2
FLUBS:	Hello, Regal.
regal swan:	yo peeps
FLUBS:	welp. at least we're up 3-0. and im carrying üòõ
FLUBS:	oh...my squadmate's power just went out
FLUBS:	i have, and will ask for help. i had just been so skittied by life i was having none of anything at that point i guess
SquidofBaconator:	Lol
FLUBS:	well this was 3-4 months after i got the chair, so i didnt want to be a burden and i wanted to be independent. so i didnt let her help. she still could have, but she didnt because she knew that i had to come around on my own
Lord Krelian:	Why did you refuse to let your sister help you?
FLUBS:	why what?
Lord Krelian:	Why?
FLUBS:	lol. that is amazing. tmk i got no nicknames
FLUBS:	that was about 2 years ago. i was really stubborn and had my sister in the room. i refused to let her help me.
SquidofBaconator:	The more you know
SquidofBaconator:	Well, the "Squid" part of my name comes from a nickname back in middle school. I used to have a much more nasally voice and I got the nickname "Squidward" Squid for short
FLUBS:	for 35 minutes
FLUBS:	yep
Lord Krelian:	and got stuck in the box?
FLUBS:	the name comes from a time i literally fell into a box
SquidofBaconator:	I love puns üòÉ
FLUBS:	yet i guess it should be expected
FLUBS:	I hate you
SquidofBaconator:	You're "Stuck"? Lol
FLUBS:	*noms YuGiOh*
FLUBS:	yeah, i got off a med yesterday because i had been doing well. it helps me regain function faster. the day i get off it im stuck for 15 minutes. so i guess back on it i go
Dragonite:	_pokes YuGiOh_
SquidofBaconator:	I don't play YuGiOh
Neon Strike Kitty:	*is wondering if anyone wants to play YuGiOh*
SquidofBaconator:	Well, I hope the next couple of days go better
FLUBS:	which i did, and im still a little miffed
FLUBS:	he understands that i had a real garbage night if im sending him something like that
FLUBS:	i texted my dad last night "im sleeping till noon, ill explain later. please dont wake me."
FLUBS:	damn, that sucks dude.
Master9000:	dad woke me up at 10:50 t- read above lol already wrote it once
FLUBS:	Good morning, everone. I guess I was telling the truth when I said sleeping till noon.
Master9000:	Apple missed such a great opportunity with this one
Master9000:	
Master9000:	That's the point
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's the wrong numerical code

`Master9000: but then he just SKITTYed it all up by then asking me how to eject the SKITTYing flash drive which he then flopped around for 2 minutes until he reopened explorer and did it`
Master9000:	The one thing that was remotely acceptable for waking me up in that was how to add the # tab and set it for all the songs
Crow_Songs:	skitty
Crow_Songs:	actual
Crow_Songs:	the

superheronerd:	That is rather lucky then
SuperGummying:	_makes more sylveon noises_

Mee6:	<@!239928598696427520>, you just advanced to **level 18** !

FLUBS:	that is good. perhaps better because i get to watch him suffer
Dragonite:	it's not bannable but now gummy doesn't have a hand so it'll be hard for him to do it again
SuperGummying:	Noooo my hand
FLUBS:	is dog slapping bannable? it should be bannable.
Dragonite:	_noms Gummy's hand_
SuperGummying:	_slaps Dragonite _
FLUBS:	this seems like a mod issue. help.
FLUBS:	please do not slap my dogs.
SuperGummying:	_slaps penny _
FLUBS:	she is a strong little girl and cant be spooked
FLUBS:	penny is unspookable
SuperGummying:	_spooks penny as well_
FLUBS:	*penny exacts revenge*
SuperGummying:	_spooks benny even more _
FLUBS:	youre right. sorry gummy. wait. no. no sorry. he hurt me and spooked benny!
Dragonite:	well dont ruin his illusion
FLUBS:	you cant shoot...
FLUBS:	youre chained to a wall
SuperGummying:	_shoots _

Deino Mite:	But it makes me think of gummy so...
Deino Mite:	Th picture is cute
Deino Mite:	Exactly
FLUBS:	I think will made a really cute picture, but your profile is gross.
willofd2011:	Hmm?
SuperGummying:	So 6
SuperGummying:	Actually count will
SuperGummying:	So only 5 people
Dragonite:	(it should be count+1)
Deino Mite:	But the cuteness is canceled by the gummyness.
Dragonite:	```bannedCount>message.content.split(" ").length*0.3```
computer science at its finest
SuperGummying:	So in total 6 people called it cute
Dragonite:	<@!162952008712716288> well you didnt tell me to pay attention
SuperGummying:	Finally
SuperGummying:	YES
FLUBS:	I was so pissed. Then I tried getting up.  I couldn't. In the morning I asked my doctor. Long story short I can pretty much not walk, and I lost the ability the day before a race that I had a solid chance of winning.
Master9000:	i told you about that earlier <@!137336478291329024>
Deino Mite:	And yes, I am a boy so there is a boy who thinks its cute.
Dragonite:	that's funny, the one-in-three swear should have been reprinted by the bot
FLUBS:	So when I was 16, I had a seizure in the middle of class. It was really weird because I was sitting in class with a headache and then it was 12 hours later and I was in a hospital. I had been training to run in a race for the last 5 months and couldn't because they wouldn't even let me get out of bed yet.
Deino Mite:	I think it's cute, but because it's your profile pic, it's cuteness is canceled out.
Crow_Songs:	gummy
SuperGummying:	Even my sister said it was cute btw
SuperGummying:	What is this?
SuperGummying:	So far only girls have said it was cute
Master9000:	oof

SquidofBaconator:	Squids aren't meant to climb mountains. I'll stick to Splatoon 2
SuperGummying:	Fine squid can come
Dragonite:	_flings Gummy head-first into a bank of show and causes an avalanche anyway_
FLUBS:	*rolls out*
FLUBS:	hmm
SuperGummying:	Probably
FLUBS:	is that the *only* reason you dont want me climbing a mountain with you?
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you look like you haven't seen an avalanche up close yet lol
SuperGummying:	_looks at Dragonite _
SuperGummying:	Imma pick someone nice to me
SuperGummying:	I don't want you

SuperGummying:	_burns paperwork _
regal swan:	i love my mom but i see where my mouth runs away from brain thing comes from

FLUBS:	what would that be considered? motionist?
FLUBS:	first you blow up a poor sylveon now punching a guy because hes in a wheelchair? wow.
FLUBS:	punching?
FLUBS:	ok wow gummy
FLUBS:	the sylveon is ok
FLUBS:	*gummy used explode* *it wasnt very effective*
SuperGummying:	_punches stuck _
SuperGummying:	Noooooooo
FLUBS:	*is out of the well, throws a sylveon down the well right before gummy blows it up*
SuperGummying:	_blows the well up _
FLUBS:	*walks up the side of the well*
SuperGummying:	_throws stuck down a well_
FLUBS:	i was refrencing the copypasta
SuperGummying:	_moonblast _
FLUBS:	owo whats this?
SuperGummying:	_jumps on you _
FLUBS:	it was all in your head, gummy. how do you think a guy in a wheelchair is gonna kick you in the face?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm gonna let you two settle this.
SuperGummying:	Ida he's abusing me
SuperGummying:	_Starts to cry _

Master9000:	hwo dark
FLUBS:	How so? Give an example?
FLUBS:	mine is too
FLUBS:	is it gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	My sense of humor is too dark.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I really have a problem
FLUBS:	There is nothing unfair about that
FLUBS:	That is an even playing field
SuperGummying:	Remember
SuperGummying:	And she was in a wheelchair
SuperGummying:	Stuck you punched regal
FLUBS:	y u do dis
FLUBS:	<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
FLUBS:	~~the black winds~~ the news channel...i feel a message will soon be upon us
Master9000:	theres no stream today
Neon Strike Kitty:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.>
FLUBS:	but do you feel it?
FLUBS:	shut up
Neon Strike Kitty:	The disturbance is that typo
FLUBS:	ida can you feel the disturbance?
FLUBS:	theres a difference between me punching you and you punching me
FLUBS:	you got beat up by a borderline paraplegic.
SuperGummying:	You speak cursive then
SuperGummying:	Ida no bad
SuperGummying:	Yet you beat me up the other day
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~CURSIVE~~
FLUBS:	nor run away...
FLUBS:	i cant even defend myself
FLUBS:	ok that is just rude
SuperGummying:	_throws stuck with ribbons _
FLUBS:	i might be untrippable
FLUBS:	how do you trip me?
SuperGummying:	_trips stuck with ribbons _
FLUBS:	like i've said, the channel name does not make me think pleasant thoughts when a message comes through
FLUBS:	well gummy can i not because sylveons are untrippable or is it because anything i was able to trip would have to fall over me already? i can extend my foot about an inch from where it rests.
Master9000:	possibly
SuperGummying:	You can't trip a sylveon
SuperGummying:	No
FLUBS:	*eyes <#305488106050813954>* 
there is a disturbence in the force. can you feel it?
FLUBS:	i mean the whole preview thing kinda ruins it
FLUBS:	http://i.imgur.com/Pb3wfLI.jpg
FLUBS:	this says otherwise
SuperGummying:	You can't trip a sylveon
FLUBS:	dont look into the possiblity of me tripping someone
FLUBS:	*trips*
SuperGummying:	_runs around again_
FLUBS:	i think today is the last day of my sub...
FLUBS:	i just flipped them off and went on my phone
FLUBS:	like...one of the first things my friends did after i was pretty much ~~stuck~~ trapped in this thing was lift it up by the back and push my onto the ground then pull the thing away.
SuperGummying:	im never serious
FLUBS:	not in this case. it's good when its funny. thats why you joking is bad, gummy.
Master9000:	what happened to you being "never serious"
SuperGummying:	joking is bad
FLUBS:	personally i like jokes about it.
FLUBS:	im only mad because wordplay is the worst
FLUBS:	but i dont care
FLUBS:	go on about how you are insulting and discriminating against me for my illness
Neon Strike Kitty:	I realized after I posted it that it might have crossed a line.
FLUBS:	i mean i could get all kinds of fake triggered
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sorry
FLUBS:	that was so bad
FLUBS:	I really want to punch you right now
willofd2011:	Lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Stuck*
FLUBS:	ah. i found it. im lazy
FLUBS:	my chair sucks. im in it like 18 hours a day and i hate the damn thing. but im stuck here most of the time. thats why i like my bed. freedom from the chair
FLUBS:	i cant find it üò¶
willofd2011:	Maybe because your chair was so comfy that you slept on it last night? Idk lol
Master9000:	re read the chat from last night?
FLUBS:	I'm asking everyone who was on last night
Master9000:	
SuperGummying:	so my sister went from watching anime to korean shows so kill me

SuperGummying:	you spoke italian
FLUBS:	Hello, Will.
FLUBS:	didnt gummy speak french yesterday?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Why is it called cursive?
willofd2011:	Pretty much lol
Master9000:	not english
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seriously, what the SKITTY do you mean by cursive?
Master9000:	theres actual very slight amount of backing for czar being less cursive
Master9000:	wait lmfao
SuperGummying:	tsar
Neon Strike Kitty:	what's cursive?
FLUBS:	my kind of moderating
Master9000:	**inserts some bullshit about spelling**

SuperGummying:	you just said czar
Master9000:	no cursive
SuperGummying:	but I prefer
SuperGummying:	i know he's ivan 4
FLUBS:	well he did say he was gonna become a crazy cat lady
SuperGummying:	no
Master9000:	gummy said one of the main reasons he likes ivan 4 is torture so im sure hes cool with it
FLUBS:	it is funny though
FLUBS:	then you would not like my cat story
SuperGummying:	imma become a crazy cat person
FLUBS:	it's dead...
SuperGummying:	_plays with cat_
FLUBS:	its a running thing
FLUBS:	its talking about my neuromuscular disease and that cat story that breaks several rules if i were to tell it.
FLUBS:	its actually a really skittied up joke in two ways
Master9000:	_throws cat hair at flubs_
FLUBS:	hehehe. my sister just texted me. she congratulated me for "beating the cats curse"
FLUBS:	dont palm your face at me. you are shopping. online. but it is still shopping

Neon Strike Kitty:	Such as "gg, hope you had fun"
Neon Strike Kitty:	btw, some people had things to say to you in the hub
SuperGummying:	I kill you first
SuperGummying:	Next time we play
SuperGummying:	Thanks
Dragonite:	brb life'
Neon Strike Kitty:	Still, I gotta say that your role was utilized well.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, I guess that can't be helped.
SuperGummying:	And that's why my lying was bad
SuperGummying:	So I panic
SuperGummying:	Well it was because I forgot about the game until it was too late
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's kind of important to set up your lie to be believable and consistent.
SuperGummying:	Told you I was a townie
SuperGummying:	Due to my amazing afk and lying skills
SuperGummying:	I almost did
SuperGummying:	Yup
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, it's the first mafia game you didn't survive until the end
SuperGummying:	_chews on Dragonite's head_
Crow_Songs:	cocoa
Crow_Songs:	of
Crow_Songs:	8oz
Crow_Songs:	it was
Dragonite:	tapu cocoa?
Master9000:	<@!212257792722075650>
Master9000:	8oz of cocoa as in???
SuperGummying:	Pimaster it was
Crow_Songs:	was 2.25 decent for trying it?
Crow_Songs:	but it's terrible
Crow_Songs:	i bought 8oz of cocoa
Crow_Songs:	guys
SuperDragonite2172:	It's amazing....ly terrible.
Deino Mite:	No it's not
SuperGummying:	You seen the video
SuperGummying:	My dancing was amazing
Dragonite:	(ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)
Dragonite:	it also doesn't work for gummy 'cause he sucks at dancing
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm putting the game on hiatus again
SuperGummying:	Who cares
Deino Mite:	It doesn't  always work on pokemon go because it's not a 3DS
SuperGummying:	And I caught something in Pokemon go
SuperGummying:	Dragonite I just did that
Deino Mite:	Ah
Neon Strike Kitty:	and after that it goes right to the battle
Zek:	<@!137336478291329024> can confirm
Deino Mite:	Oh
Neon Strike Kitty:	My save file is in the champion room
Neon Strike Kitty:	Deino
Neon Strike Kitty:	I got it
Deino Mite:	Why don't you go buy more pokeballs then come back and catch it.
SuperDragonite2172:	There's a Mystery Gift event for a shiny Tapu Koko.
Dragonite:	if you hold your 3DS upside down while dancing the Charleston you have a 100% chance to catch anything instantly (ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)
Neon Strike Kitty:	?
SuperDragonite2172:	Don't forget to do the event for the shiny Tapu Koko.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah but I intend to catch it this chance
RC:	yeah, you can
WFOF | Inferno:	im pretty sure you can get a second chance... dont quote me on that though
Neon Strike Kitty:	I ran out of luxury balls, dusk balls, premier balls, timer balls, fast balls....
Neon Strike Kitty:	I ran out of great balls
Deino Mite:	That's a problem then
Deino Mite:	Oh
Neon Strike Kitty:	I ran out of regular ones
Deino Mite:	Use regular poke balls
Dragonite:	_disowns Inferno again_
Deino Mite:	You don't need ultra balls
WFOF | Inferno:	You were never my father to begin with, how can you disown me? <@!137336478291329024>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I did not know to stock up
Neon Strike Kitty:	It might be a slight problem that I have 2 Ultra Balls
Dragonite:	_disowns Inferno_
WFOF | Inferno:	*I sold my copy of moon*
Dragonite:	_yells at Tapu Koko_
SuperDragonite2172:	Ouch.
Neon Strike Kitty:	It struggled itself to death again
SuperGummying:	_shakes Ida's hand and gives her Lillie _
Neon Strike Kitty:	OH WHAT DO YOU KNOW
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't remember having much trouble with Primal Groudon
SuperGummying:	Ida finishes moon while I have let go finish both copies
Dragonite:	some of my friends were rather upset at me for that
Neon Strike Kitty:	I ran out of Poke Balls
Dragonite:	i caught Primal Kyogre in a single try with a Nest Ball
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Inferno.
WFOF | Inferno:	also o/
Deino Mite:	I catch legendaries like Eyan does. In pokeballs.
SuperDragonite2172:	So was mine, Ida.
WFOF | Inferno:	I think it might have been a nest ball actually
WFOF | Inferno:	I caught it with a random pokeball I had laying around
Neon Strike Kitty:	My save file is right before the champion battle
SuperDragonite2172:	Although I did manage to catch it then I went and bought 50 Ultra Balls.
Dragonite:	funnily enough i dont remember having much trouble catching anything in that game
Neon Strike Kitty:	It killed itself with Struggle on my last try
SuperDragonite2172:	I almost ran out at well.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm running out of Poke Balls
SuperDragonite2172:	I finished the main story recently myself.
Neon Strike Kitty:	TAPU KOKO YOU LITTLE SKITTY
Neon Strike Kitty:	Main story
SuperDragonite2172:	Main story or post-game?
Dragonite:	ouo;
Neon Strike Kitty:	btw, I'm actually finishing Pokemon Moon
SuperGummying:	Yum strawberry
SuperGummying:	_eats jam _
Dragonite:	but game jams
Neon Strike Kitty:	*tries to get Drago to play the next one*
Dragonite:	they're discussing a Mafia game
SuperGummying:	But good job catching my lying
SuperGummying:	Yeah let's wait
FLUBS:	i feel like im missing something here...
Neon Strike Kitty:	We probably shouldn't discuss this until the game ends, though
Neon Strike Kitty:	But I was at my absolute most dangerous this game üòõ
SuperGummying:	Since you weren't dangerous
SuperGummying:	I couldn't
SuperGummying:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
Dragonite:	kindly do not kill any of the Gurus
Neon Strike Kitty:	But you never had the chance üòõ
SuperGummying:	I knew I should have killed you when I had the chance üò†
Neon Strike Kitty:	See when the endgame rolls around
Master9000:	oof
Neon Strike Kitty:	I caught on a lot quicker than this üòõ
SuperGummying:	You finally caught my lying
SuperGummying:	Ida congrats
SuperGummying:	Oh already did Ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	Thanks Gummy
Dragonite:	_writes Zs all over Master's face_
Master9000:	<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Dragonite:	i said write, not type
Master9000:	~~***ZZZZZ***~~
Dragonite:	the letter "Z" is fun to write
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, can you check the mafia game real quick?
SuperGummying:	Dragonite bad
Dragonite:	i think i know why it does that, i'm just too lazy to fix it

FLUBS:	Hello soon, Kugal.
Kugallyblitz:	Guys ill be on in a bit

Dragonite:	because that sounds like spm
Rainy:	I iwsh it was me
BlackAceZeroExeV2:	*hugs <@!139579058152275968> * don't be sad ;_;

FLUBS:	*grabs bat*
Dragonite:	are you not tired of this gag yet
BlackAceZeroExeV2:	i don't care! i don't have a tounge anymore!
FLUBS:	the test was skewed because the different tastes  would carry over
Rainy:	Just makes it harder to eat without choking
BlackAceZeroExeV2:	*hits <@!139579058152275968> with a baseball bat*
Rainy:	So, Ace, I can cut out most of your tongue and things won't taste different

Rainy:	Well it's not true
Rainy:	You know how in elementary school you were taught that different parts of the tongue are more sensitive to different flavours?
FLUBS:	NO PUNCHING!
FLUBS:	_blocks punch_
BlackAceZeroExeV2:	*punches <@!139579058152275968> *
FLUBS:	get the husky, gummy. benny and penny are the reason im alive today tbh and they make me so happy. dogs are little rays of sunshine. train them properly and youll never regret it
FLUBS:	fair
FLUBS:	huh
Dragonite:	or just post it in meme chat

FLUBS:	Hi
Dell098:	Bye
Dell098:	Hey
FLUBS:	like gene(the main character) says "what would a teen want to hide on his phone from his parents?" and the other person...emoji....thing...just stares at the camera.
FLUBS:	also there are some great jokes that kids wouldnt get.
FLUBS:	i may see it again. the whole thing is a pun inside a pun inside a pun.
FLUBS:	it has a 6 on rotten tomatoes. but i love it so much.
FLUBS:	it was so good
FLUBS:	its so good!
FLUBS:	lol rainy
FLUBS:	he just gave advice that was stupidly obvious

Demon_Lord 93:	nope
FLUBS:	nope
SuperGummying:	can you hear me?
FLUBS:	well stupid on my part
Rainy:	Sounds like gummy
FLUBS:	in a very stupid way
FLUBS:	ah. perhaps i should be nicer to gummy. he did help me out a ton
SuperGummying:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9hluyfRVPw
Rainy:	I was just saying hi, but I can arrange that
FLUBS:	because i want the blood on the sword if you do
Rainy:	Hey there will ^-^
FLUBS:	are you gonna stab him?
Rainy:	*nonchalantly nods at gummy*
Rainy:	Alright, I'll get one to you in a week or so
FLUBS:	am not weeb
FLUBS:	i do not have swords within reach
willofd2011:	Hi rainy ^w^
Rainy:	Just cut them off with a sword
SuperGummying:	_waves to rainy_
FLUBS:	getting the jams on is half the battle
FLUBS:	well then i still have my clothes on under
Rainy:	or something
Rainy:	Just wear a snuggy to bed, problem solved
FLUBS:	gummy ill listen if you teach me how to get into pajamas while sitting. it is the ultimate pain
FLUBS:	it. is. terrible.
FLUBS:	3 years and i still dont know how to effectivally get into pajamas...anyone got any tips?
FLUBS:	i saw that. i agree.
FLUBS:	America!
FLUBS:	got an old lady to do it for me. flipped it on her!
FLUBS:	oh jeez. gotta go convince a neighbor to go downstairs and bring my laundry up for me üòê
FLUBS:	nobody else got the joke...
FLUBS:	that was a fun time. sir patrick stewart plays a shit emoji. when the world is ending he spins around in the captains chair from star trek tng and screams "red alert!" i started laughing in the theater.
Dragonite:	i liked it better at zero percent
FLUBS:	6%
FLUBS:	https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_emoji_movie/
FLUBS:	and the rotten tomatoes score proves it
FLUBS:	it is so good
FLUBS:	to anyone who has not seen it: i cannot reccomend the emoji movie enough
FLUBS:	bunni is a real person when i hear her voice!
FLUBS:	though penny does still eat benny's food.
FLUBS:	lol. if i open my dogs food cans the one will come running. i give them different brands for that reason.
Nekomata_Kohaku:	I have successfully lured the cat inside XD and the trick to do so was bring her food bowl and tap on it XD and she came running to the door
FLUBS:	üòÉ
FLUBS:	im gonna do it! gonna go into chat! im very frightened...
FLUBS:	that 3.6 kg for you gummys
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Brb gonna check on Vivian see if she is ready to come in now
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Owo
FLUBS:	my dogs are inside dogs because i have eagles in my yard and they both weigh 8 pounds.
FLUBS:	üòÆ
Nekomata_Kohaku:	I have a cat though she is being stubborn to come into the house and it's getting dark which is bad since coyotes like to roam at that time and she is not going to be coyote food...
FLUBS:	benny and penny
FLUBS:	sometimes i regret their names. not often though
FLUBS:	dogs keep me not lonely!
FLUBS:	i have dogs!
FLUBS:	wait!
FLUBS:	*stays lonely*
SuperGummying:	jump in a vc with me if you don't want to be lonely
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Though if I don't count my mom it's gonna be like a huge sausage fest owo
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Though my bro is trying to invite a friend over. . .soo it won't be too lonely..
FLUBS:	ohohoho?
willofd2011:	Sounds somewhat like when my sister goes to her fiance's house for days and stuff and whatnot lol
FLUBS:	though maybe i wont be so violent now that you bestowed some of your very low amounts of wisdom upon me
FLUBS:	wel...maybe thats a little far gummy.
FLUBS:	lol. dogs are so awesome. my two are like the best thing ever.
SuperGummying:	im not as dumb as i look
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	hey like i said
Nekomata_Kohaku:	Yeah. . .ive been toher boyfriend's house once and it is boring the only thing exciting is his dog kairi
FLUBS:	gummy, what the hell is wrong with my that never crossed my mind.
SuperGummying:	yeah just listen to us and talk in chat
FLUBS:	aw...that stinks. at least she'll be happy there!
willofd2011:	Dang O.o
Nekomata_Kohaku:	She just left to go to her boyfriend's house and won't be back til Thursday....
FLUBS:	i have not thought of that
FLUBS:	wow.
FLUBS:	uh...
FLUBS:	is she missing or jus not there?
SuperGummying:	you could just listen
SuperGummying:	i mean
SuperGummying:	ah
Nekomata_Kohaku:	*randomly sits down missing twin sister already*
FLUBS:	i have a oxygen tank (got one of those little nose guys that people get in the hospital) that helps me talk, but it isnt fun and i dont like using it. so my talking is callouts only in games nowadays.
FLUBS:	that is the reason im not gonna be in vc anytime soon tho lol
SuperGummying:	well im glad
SuperGummying:	i see
FLUBS:	took me a while to get here but now i am. and im happy for it
FLUBS:	hey man its ok to me now. im not gonna change it so im just gonna get over it and live
SuperGummying:	sorry to hear that
FLUBS:	well i cant really walk or talk anymore
SuperGummying:	wait what?
FLUBS:	well i cant really walk or talk anymore
SuperGummying:	idk what happened
SuperGummying:	tbh maybe
FLUBS:	i mean it isnt a contest but mine is kinda worse...
SuperGummying:	_chugs more üç∫_
SuperGummying:	anything else?
SuperGummying:	thats why i only believe in revenge, and im unstable
SuperGummying:	change my life as well
FLUBS:	well it depressed me for two years but completely changed my life (arguably for the worse) forever
SuperGummying:	_eats chicken_
SuperGummying:	for the rest of my life
SuperGummying:	for me
SuperGummying:	for you it may be two years
SuperGummying:	thats why im insane
SuperGummying:	it was 3 bad days
SuperGummying:	for me
FLUBS:	i agree. one bad day just ruined my life for a solid two years.
SuperGummying:	can cause it all
SuperGummying:	one bad day
SuperGummying:	like i told you
FLUBS:	yeah you have plenty of your own
SuperGummying:	i don't need your negative vibes
FLUBS:	im never going to bed.
SuperGummying:	leave
superheronerd:	Goodnight!
FLUBS:	nighters
SuperGummying:	good
Deino Mite:	bye friends
Deino Mite:	anyways, i need to go to bed
SuperGummying:	she is nice to me thats all
Master9000:	oof
Deino Mite:	she probably is doing both
SuperGummying:	she is not
Deino Mite:	and since bunni is gummy
Deino Mite:	gummy would do both
FLUBS:	but most of all...he a fec
FLUBS:	or both!
Master9000:	but most importantly, he maik ahlt
SuperGummying:	im assuming driving or sleeping
SuperGummying:	she's away tbh
Deino Mite:	ya it is a normie meme
FLUBS:	but most of all...he anoy
Master9000:	i forgot the meme already after the normies infected it
superheronerd:	He no get protec
Deino Mite:	he dont get protecc
FLUBS:	he get attac
SuperGummying:	help im being attack
Master9000:	<@!208043048293105677>
SuperGummying:	or sit here and watch
SuperGummying:	ping bunni
Master9000:	~~the more we make contact with you the more angry and negative you get ~~
Deino Mite:	that the negative vibes get punched out of you
SuperGummying:	i have two options
FLUBS:	i think i just had a personal overflow error. i felt bad for myself for so long i looped around and went back to how i was like 4 years ago
SuperGummying:	go ahead
Deino Mite:	so hard
Deino Mite:	no, we just hit you
SuperGummying:	just the more angry and negative i get
SuperGummying:	the more you hit me with negative vibes
SuperGummying:	but im used to it
Deino Mite:	i think we should hit gummy hard enough that the negative vibes get knocked out of him
SuperGummying:	everything i see in my life is mostly negative
SuperGummying:	well i haven't
FLUBS:	gummy i lost my postive vibes years ago too. then i found them last year and im at peace with myself.
Master9000:	`!clear @SuperGummying#7574`
Master9000:	watch how fast the bots are tho
Dragonite:	bollocks
Deino Mite:	sure...
SuperGummying:	fast you mods are
SuperGummying:	to see how um
Master9000:	<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
SuperGummying:	a test
Master9000:	BULL. SKITTYING. SKITTY.
SuperGummying:	that was um
SuperGummying:	and dragonite
SuperGummying:	i lost my positive mood years ago
Deino Mite:	to quote Brian from Monty Python's Life of Brian "Always look on the bright side of life."
FLUBS:	i mean i could go in vc i guess. i have ways around not being able to...but if anything id mute myself.
Dragonite:	you literally posted a document with your surname in chat
Deino Mite:	gummy, learn to be more positive
SuperGummying:	i know privacy well
willofd2011:	Lol XD
Dragonite:	because youre gummy
SuperGummying:	why would i do that?
Dragonite:	now what
SuperGummying:	dragonite
Deino Mite:	you need to spread some positive vibes
Master9000:	BULL. SKITTYING. SKITTY.
Dragonite:	the other way around isnt exactly okay either if you dont have permission
Deino Mite:	thats not good gummy
SuperGummying:	i hate almost everyone yes
FLUBS:	the other way around is ok.
FLUBS:	gummy that is not ok. like...at all...
SuperGummying:	and my like list is low
Deino Mite:	so you show pictures of everyone
Dragonite:	yeah let's not go there
SuperGummying:	not people i actually like
SuperGummying:	i show pictures of people i hate
FLUBS:	that is why.
FLUBS:	they are
SuperGummying:	pimaster
SuperGummying:	i mean stuck thinks regal and ida are a bots
Deino Mite:	gummy, you have shown pictures of people before
FLUBS:	i cant really talk in vc so that may be a problem
SuperGummying:	but i don't show pictures of people because private reasons
Deino Mite:	if you both get in a vc and we hear you both talk, then that would be some good proof
FLUBS:	if i dont have first hand experience, they are not real.
SuperGummying:	i have stuck
Dragonite:	gummy taking a photo with a random cosplayer doesnt prove that a name on the internet is real
FLUBS:	i have had no true voice to voice contact, nor have i seen her face.
SuperGummying:	i'll meet bunni one day and show you guys we are real
FLUBS:	i dont believe.
Deino Mite:	bunni isnt
Deino Mite:	regal is
FLUBS:	hmmm...maybe id like to meet bunni and regal to see if theyre real.
SuperGummying:	<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
FLUBS:	gummy has alts here.
SuperGummying:	pimaster no bad
FLUBS:	THANK YOU!
SuperGummying:	oh yeah sure
FLUBS:	though i wont go to any cons soon you youre safe.
Deino Mite:	gummy, im still pretty sure buni is just an alt account
FLUBS:	i will brind a gun, then punch your corpse.
willofd2011:	Night squid ^w^
SuperGummying:	i got two close besties plus ida or dragonite will also protect me
EyanSays:	‡≤†_‡≤†

superheronerd:	See ya, squid
FLUBS:	goodnight, squid.
SquidofBaconator:	All right, I'm gonna go watch YouTube and then go to bed, as I do every night. Later
Deino Mite:	yep
FLUBS:	a hello, handshake, perhaps an exchange of names then im on my way
Master9000:	then he goes back to being a weeb and trying to get in eyans pants
superheronerd:	You must pass the interview
Deino Mite:	ok
FLUBS:	but only briefly
Deino Mite:	yay!
FLUBS:	fair. you get to be met too.
Deino Mite:	i do too
FLUBS:	i refuse to accept it. gummy needs a punch, master seems like he would be fun, eyan and i seem to have similar game choices, and squid knows the secret, same with bella.
Dragonite:	that sounds like a good way to get kicked out of the convention center, gummy
SuperGummying:	i got two close besties to protect gummy
SquidofBaconator:	Bullskitty
SuperGummying:	_looks at regal and bunni_
SuperGummying:	i'll have people to protect me
SquidofBaconator:	Bullskitty
FLUBS:	will cannot be that cheery
SuperGummying:	and you know what stuck

SquidofBaconator:	I'm glad you would want to meet me
SuperGummying:	oh i'll punch you
FLUBS:	thats about it. i would not mind meeting others but i am interested in what they are like irl.
Master9000:	ill be the ~~screeching~~ meeting point
superheronerd:	Thanks stuck üòÅ
Master9000:	<3
willofd2011:	Lol
FLUBS:	If i went to a con, i would like to meet eyan, gummy(to punch), master, will, bella, and squid.
SuperGummying:	shhhhhh
Master9000:	oh yeah <@!304445424503226368> gummy specified taht he wanted 24 not 12 titans in that build earlier <:LUL:305559915714576385>
SuperGummying:	now i want to meet master but he threaten me
willofd2011:	Later Ida ^w^
SuperGummying:	yes i do want to meet dragonite for some odd reason
FLUBS:	thanks gummy
FLUBS:	goodnight ida
Deci:	cya ida
SuperGummying:	for me besides Eyan i just wanna meet bunni, will, and dragonite
superheronerd:	Bye ida
Deci:	sup
Dragonite:	don't - oh rubbish
SquidofBaconator:	Rip
SuperGummying:	_pokes ida_
willofd2011:	Almost forgot deci lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	*dies*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Right, I'm gonna pass out now
willofd2011:	And hi  <@304445424503226368> Lol ^w^
FLUBS:	ha, gummy! im insane and im not fun to be around!
SquidofBaconator:	I know I'm weird, but I'm no creep üòè
superheronerd:	Thanks ida
FLUBS:	^w^
SuperGummying:	only insane
SuperGummying:	im no creep
willofd2011:	There lol ^w^
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~I don't think I'd like to meet any of you irl, you're all creepy~~
FLUBS:	I havent gone to cons because while i could easily get in...traversing is not pleasant
Dragonite:	i remember the first year i went Zeal posted a thing on like December 29 that said "oh yeah imma be at Magfest, if anyone wants to meet up"

that sure happened

maybe some year it will
Master9000:	well this got lively when i looked away for two seconds
SquidofBaconator:	I wouldn't mind meeting MOST of you irl if I actually went to a convention
FLUBS:	Bella doesnt get a mention
willofd2011:	Hi  <@319638082867691521> hi  <@239928598696427520> hi <@214587785510780929>
FLUBS:	Hello, will.
superheronerd:	Hello will üòÅ
willofd2011:	Hi Ida ^w^
SquidofBaconator:	Hello Will
willofd2011:	*would like to meet everyone eventually* Lol ^w^
SuperGummying:	in a few years*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hi will
Neon Strike Kitty:	What did I just say?
SquidofBaconator:	I have a car and I'm 19, but I don't have the money for gas and a hotel
SuperGummying:	ida wanna meet me?
Dragonite:	(„Å£‚óï‚Äø   ‚óï)„Å£
Deci:	didn't know that
Neon Strike Kitty:	I both mean financially and mentally
Deci:	gotcha
Deino Mite:	and im legit 15 so...
Neon Strike Kitty:	if I'm stable enough to travel on my own
SuperGummying:	if i meet deci he may lecture me on 24 titans üòÑ
Deino Mite:	that
Neon Strike Kitty:	I might go to magfest in a few years
Deci:	no car?
Deino Mite:	well im also not old enough to travel alone
Deci:	it was unplanned that we would meet too
Dragonite:	i mean i went for four years without concrete plans of meeting anyone, it's no big deal (me and deci just kind of met at the last second before i went home)
SquidofBaconator:	I live in the middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania. Too far away from any convention
Neon Strike Kitty:	URF is next weekend
FLUBS:	Still have no friends though...
SuperGummying:	he would find a way to get me kicked out
Deino Mite:	ya but id want to go with an IRL friend too
Neon Strike Kitty:	Uhh
SuperGummying:	and no it won't be dragonite
FLUBS:	Local cons are great, live in new york so a bunch are an hour and a few bucks away.
Deci:	Multiple people from this server (at least me and dragonite) will be at MAGfest
SuperGummying:	i would want to travel to a convention and meet up with someone
SquidofBaconator:	Also, I got no friends...
SquidofBaconator:	I don't have the money to travel and I don't think my parents would want to help fund it
Deino Mite:	*doesn't like traveling and has no one to go to magfest with*
Deci:	you lied to me T.T?
Deci:	but it's not?
Deci:	and i was so excited it was on live
Deci:	you were talking about urf
SquidofBaconator:	I have never been to any type of convention before
SuperGummying:	_tempted to got to magfest to provoke dragonite_
Neon Strike Kitty:	Wait, I forgot I don't have Camille on live
Dragonite:	excellent
SuperGummying:	i rather not
Deci:	yes, I will be there
SuperGummying:	er
Neon Strike Kitty:	*I mistyped shot at first*
FLUBS:	Hello, Deci. I hid a secret from gummy. He doesn't have a clue.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Wanna give it a shot?
Dragonite:	<@!304445424503226368> magfest registration opens in two weeks, you going next year? (yes i know i asked this already, i forgot, leave me alone)
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
SuperGummying:	ida you will still beat me in a 1v1 with that champ
Neon Strike Kitty:	I promise
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'll get practice and get good
SuperGummying:	oh he didn't really
Neon Strike Kitty:	;~;
Deino Mite:	lol
SuperGummying:	deci is about to flip
Deci:	I feel pain
FLUBS:	Yo lo estudio por siete anos!
SuperGummying:	oh boy
Deci:	That score kills me
Kugallyblitz:	howdy frands
Neon Strike Kitty:	*IN MY DEFENSE* that was Urf
superheronerd:	Hey squid, same.
Neon Strike Kitty:	so I just jumped on him
Deino Mite:	<@!304445424503226368> look at ida's camille score
FLUBS:	Secrets stay secrets.
Neon Strike Kitty:	and he was low
FLUBS:	No pinning anything from tonight.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Like Rengar was alone and my team just ignored him while they were pushing
SuperGummying:	don't worry you just need more practice
SuperGummying:	still at least you got something
Neon Strike Kitty:	It was the last kill of the game
Deino Mite:	inb4 pinned
SuperGummying:	you got a kill
SuperGummying:	not bad
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't tell Deci
SuperGummying:	how ida?
Neon Strike Kitty:	
SuperGummying:	speak nerd for us
SuperGummying:	dragonite
Neon Strike Kitty:	You know how I found out?
FLUBS:	Will you share the secret?
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, I just found out that Camille is a heavily skill based champ
SquidofBaconator:	Ok
SuperGummying:	yes i have
Dragonite:	guys i dont personally care if you speak other languages but you should really probably stop before master finds out
Deino Mite:	and gummy, you have not demonstrated a very good understanding of english for me to believe you know it
SquidofBaconator:	Good secret
FLUBS:	Si...
SquidofBaconator:	Yo hablo Espanol. Yo lo estudio por cuatro anos
Deino Mite:	very good
FLUBS:	How was the secret?
FLUBS:	Learn freedom.
SuperGummying:	i know english
FLUBS:	Or freedom speach
SuperGummying:	bleh
Deino Mite:	or English
SquidofBaconator:	No hablo francois
Deino Mite:	or Japanese
SuperGummying:	bleh
Deino Mite:	like Latin
FLUBS:	Learn a good language.
SuperGummying:	lol
SuperGummying:	Je ne devrais pas couvrir mes oreilles
FLUBS:	So my chair has wheels. Bella called me rolly polly and it is only slightly offensive. You can call me it but never explain it.
SquidofBaconator:	Or look away from the screen lol
FLUBS:	hmmm...both of you may. Gummy, cover your ears.
SquidofBaconator:	Sure, why not?
Deino Mite:	me
FLUBS:	Anyone but gummy.
FLUBS:	So who wants to hear a fun secret?
Deino Mite:	and i want to see it for myself
SuperGummying:	regal!!! big sis i need help
Deino Mite:	i actually have never been around when  we have banished gummy before
Deino Mite:	so, banish?
FLUBS:	i have blundered.
FLUBS:	ah
FLUBS:	I vote for ganish bummy
SuperGummying:	"to slay your sons and companions"
SquidofBaconator:	üöΩ
Dragonite:	im seeing a lot of votes for "banish gummy" so far
SuperGummying:	üá´üá∑
Kireina:	"Vote in responses"  Not reactions <:FailFish:327304577261240322>
superheronerd:	Can confirm, stuck
Deino Mite:	üá¶
SquidofBaconator:	Damn French...
Dragonite:	vote in responses
Dragonite:	üá¶ banish gummy
üáß banish gummy
üöΩ banish gummy
SuperGummying:	_makes fun of drem yok lol_
FLUBS:	I will be back in a few minutes, then I shall tell one person the most amazing secret their mind will explode. Bella can confirm it is a good secret.
Dragonite:	let's Banish Gummy
SquidofBaconator:	No
SuperGummying:	let's make dragonite mad
superheronerd:	Hopefully so
Deino Mite:	also, im taking a game design class in one week so ill be able to make it a lot better after that hopefully
SquidofBaconator:	Lol. Then keep it that way
Dragonite:	it provokes gummy to see it like so
Dragonite:	why wouldnt it be dragonoob
SuperGummying:	_screams regal's name_
SquidofBaconator:	Your name is still "Dragonoob"? Lol
Deino Mite:	hopefully ill get to work on it more once we get more staff at work
FLUBS:	You may know too, I suppose. An enemy of gummy's is a friend of mine.
SuperGummying:	_still waiting for someone nice to me to pop in_
Dragonite:	rip
SuperGummying:	..............................................................................................................
Deino Mite:	its coming slower cuz im working a lot right now
Deino Mite:	we arent friends anymore? YAY!
Deino Mite:	happy to help
SuperGummying:	we are no longer friends
Deino Mite:	üòÉ
Dragonite:	so how's the Harem of Zeal coming, pimaster?
SuperGummying:	screw you pimaster
FLUBS:	^
Deino Mite:	it would be better if gummy drank nothing so he died of dehydration
SuperGummying:	there
FLUBS:	Though I suppose I could tell Squid.
SquidofBaconator:	üçº
SuperGummying:	i was drinking
SquidofBaconator:	Don't drink alcohol, drink this Gummy
SuperGummying:	don't ask squid
FLUBS:	Gummy. No underage drinking.
SquidofBaconator:	No
SquidofBaconator:	Also, why is your name changed?
SuperGummying:	a drunk gummy is a fun gummy
FLUBS:	We dont need a gummy.
SquidofBaconator:	No, we don't need a drunk Gummy
SuperGummying:	_chugs üç∫_
FLUBS:	Gummy is a minor.
FLUBS:	Which I see no reason to. So it shall not be revealed.
SuperGummying:	hey who is up for a drunk friday night call?
FLUBS:	Which makes it not the fact of which I speak, as that fact is always a secret, until such a time as I reason to reveal it to you.
SquidofBaconator:	"It's a paradox! There is no answer!" -Glados
FLUBS:	to share is to accept it is not a secret.
superheronerd:	In the know
FLUBS:	It defies the nature of the fact,
superheronerd:	It would create a paradox
FLUBS:	To explain why it cannot be shared is itself sharing, and not to be done.
superheronerd:	Oh
superheronerd:	Mee6 approves
SquidofBaconator:	Mee6, be quiet
Mee6:	<@319638082867691521>, you just advanced to **level 17** !
SquidofBaconator:	You missed again. You're really bad at this, you know that?
Kireina:	mmk
FLUBS:	Becuse it cannot be.
SuperGummying:	_tackles squid_
Kireina:	Wait why can't it be shared again? ü§î
FLUBS:	Squid, do you wish to know?
superheronerd:	Not a good shot anyway
SquidofBaconator:	I'm always wearing Kevlar
FLUBS:	gummy that is not crossfire. you shot him.
SuperGummying:	game on
SuperGummying:	_shoots squid_
FLUBS:	the knowledge is sacred but not to be shared.
SquidofBaconator:	I'm glad I miss the violence. I don't get caught in the crossfire üòõ
FLUBS:	bella, panda and i are the only that know.
superheronerd:	That is to say, do we know at all?
FLUBS:	you do not know. you shall not know.
SuperGummying:	again
SuperGummying:	you miss violence
SuperGummying:	squid
SquidofBaconator:	You know not what? Lol
FLUBS:	you know what? i dont care i didnt get a hello. you know not.
FLUBS:	*hello stuck*
SquidofBaconator:	Hello Bella
superheronerd:	Hello squid!
FLUBS:	Hello, Squid. You know not.
Kireina:	Then it is so.
FLUBS:	I do believe, Panda.
Kireina:	or am I just a figment of your imagination.
SquidofBaconator:	Finally, another day of work done. How's everyone's day been?
FLUBS:	You shall not know, gummy.
Kireina:	Do you believe I do?
SuperGummying:	What thing?
Kireina:	Perhaps I don't
Kireina:	Perhaps I do
FLUBS:	scroll upwards.
FLUBS:	you no not of what we speak?
superheronerd:	My first thought was jon snow
Kireina:	I do not understand what it is you mean.
Kireina:	I know everything and nothing
Kireina:	:^)
FLUBS:	no panda. you know. gummy does not.
Kireina:	hm? What is it I don't know? <:Thonk:281612113485627392>
superheronerd:	Not knows does he
FLUBS:	he knows not?
superheronerd:	he doesn't
FLUBS:	no! do the thing! its fun!
superheronerd:	_rebellion in the matrix_
SuperGummying:	I'm going to climb Mount Everest
FLUBS:	ugh, bella. im trying to do something here.
superheronerd:	Can he do the fandango?
FLUBS:	bella, does he know?
FLUBS:	gummy do you know?
FLUBS:	you missed.
FLUBS:	no.
FLUBS:	gummy knows too
FLUBS:	or gummy
FLUBS:	and i think only me you and panda know about it now.
SuperGummying:	_shoots stuck _
SuperGummying:	Guess imma make stuck understand the hard way
superheronerd:	That is genius
superheronerd:	Stuck
SuperGummying:	Anyways
FLUBS:	like...maybe have a "does he know" "he doesnt" "he knows not?" "not knows does he" kind of conversation with someone else who knows
superheronerd:	I understand
FLUBS:	but never tell anyone why.
FLUBS:	I mean that some people would be offended by that. so yes. always do.
superheronerd:	If you do
superheronerd:	Can we call you rolly polly
FLUBS:	Don't make me roll over there.
superheronerd:	Young padawan.
superheronerd:	Shhhh.
Kireina:	sh.
FLUBS:	Well I only got it like 4 years ago...
Kireina:	But you merely adopted the chair, he was born in it, molded by it.
FLUBS:	I do not think you understand the amount of practice I get with this thing.
SuperGummying:	Boring
SuperGummying:	I did
superheronerd:	Though I am constantly in a chair with wheels, it is a fair chance in my favor.
Aren:	I dream of the day when alts won't be compared to bots
superheronerd:	Possibly, possibly.
FLUBS:	My winning chances are far higher
FLUBS:	Though you also may win.
superheronerd:	I don't mind
superheronerd:	But that's fine, racing in chairs is fun
FLUBS:	I have lots of practice in this chair.
superheronerd:	You may, yes.
FLUBS:	I may win.
superheronerd:	I will race you in these chairs
FLUBS:	I'm sitting in a chair with wheels. I will hit you with the wheels.
FLUBS:	You have angered me with your factual statements.
superheronerd:	As did you
FLUBS:	ok. someone in my friend groups' discord just said hecking lit fam
Dragonite:	all right the joke is starting to wear thin
FLUBS:	look at it.
SuperGummying:	No
FLUBS:	Gummy, please look at my previous message.
SuperGummying:	Proved it
SuperGummying:	See
SuperGummying:	See stuck
Dragonite:	no because then you'd be smart enough to actually provoke me
SuperGummying:	But do you think I have any others Dragonite?
FLUBS:	A list of bots:
>Eyan is the master bot, a bot himself yet he oversees Gummy
>Gummy is the overseer of all bots but Eyan. He makes sure the threats are eliminated. I will be next, so I have to write this down.
>The mods, gurus, royal court, and monarchs all take action on those gummy marks. threats and errors are removed.
>There is a real person who created the bots, they are a master of bots and are not stable. They believe the bots to be real.
Real, master.
Figure it out for yourself who here is the human.
Dragonite:	lillie, little, same thing
SuperGummying:	Yes
SuperGummying:	Lillie
Dragonite:	who never got made
Dragonite:	you have little bot
Dragonite:	wrong
SuperGummying:	Okay Dragonite and master know for sure I don't have bots or alt
Master9000:	show your work
Dragonite:	that depends, is it a 64 bit bot or a 32 bit bot?
FLUBS:	3
Master9000:	whats the biggest number?
FLUBS:	^
SuperGummying:	Idk 42
FLUBS:	the bots are programmed to ignore all paradoxes \
Master9000:	<@!199725993416589313> divide by zero
Master9000:	and if he really is a bot, then this should crash him
FLUBS:	jeez!
FLUBS:	HE DIDNT MAKE THE BOTS
Master9000:	if gummy really is smart enough to make a bot then he should knwo the answer to this 

<@!199725993416589313> ``` Convert 10110 to base 10```
FLUBS:	gummy, you may think yourself alive but you are not.
FLUBS:	bots can have fake memories
SuperGummying:	Dragonite has known ida for years
FLUBS:	the word of one bot means nothing
FLUBS:	that means nothing
SuperGummying:	Dragonite heard regal talk
FLUBS:	yes they are
SuperGummying:	They aren't bots
FLUBS:	yes you do
SuperGummying:	No I don't
FLUBS:	you oversee their functions
FLUBS:	gummy, you do not own the bots.
SuperGummying:	Gummy has friends that actually likes him
Dragonite:	they have bots with soft exteriors
SuperGummying:	Gummy has no bots
FLUBS:	lies
SuperGummying:	I mean
SuperGummying:	Gummy is no bot
FLUBS:	very funny at the end
FLUBS:	its a good story
FLUBS:	https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5xxh6c/the_sapient_logicbomb/
FLUBS:	i have a relevant story to destroying sapient life!
Master9000:	~~"i am the senate therefore gummy is treason" -deci~~
FLUBS:	he is not
FLUBS:	gummy does not think
FLUBS:	i think therefor i am
FLUBS:	i am sapient
FLUBS:	i know i am the only non bot
Master9000:	but at that point it doesnt matter now does it?
FLUBS:	^ gummy first
Master9000:	disect them
Master9000:	theres one way to prove someone isnt a bot
FLUBS:	^
FLUBS:	bots can have fake voices
Dragonite:	i mean, you could do a selfie with one of those name cards like they have in mugshots
FLUBS:	that is not proof
SuperGummying:	And ida is ida
SuperGummying:	We heard regal's voice
FLUBS:	you cant prove anyone is not a bot.
SuperGummying:	Sooo im good
SuperGummying:	And I kinda prove bunni isn't a bot
FLUBS:	you cannot prove that.
SuperGummying:	Nor regal
SuperGummying:	We already prove ida isn't a bot
SuperDragonite2172:	Gatdangit, Mee.
FLUBS:	swell.
Mee6:	<@!239928598696427520>, you just advanced to **level 14** !
FLUBS:	im not going deeper
SuperGummying:	_jumps on Dragonite _
Dragonite:	_lies down on the floor_
Dragonite:	Muahahahaha
Dragonite:	i just now realized i could literally make Skarm Bot be my bot alt
FLUBS:	if you want to keep lying to me
SuperGummying:	It was my flirty account
FLUBS:	i have more no videos
SuperGummying:	The only alt account I had was strike okay
SuperGummying:	_stabs aren _
FLUBS:	a bot alt
FLUBS:	oh look
Kireina:	...
superheronerd:	Hello, aren
SuperGummying:	But you really are a bot
SuperGummying:	Hey you called Ida a bot
Dragonite:	_pokes Aren_
FLUBS:	https://youtu.be/YRQvkoRXbTo?t=13s
SuperGummying:	Yes you are
FLUBS:	i cant be, i wont be.
Aren:	Such a darn shame.
FLUBS:	i am NOT a bot!
Neon Strike Kitty:	When people don't know the difference between a bot and an alt.
SuperDragonite2172:	
SuperGummying:	Ha you are a bot under Gumlin command
SuperGummying:	I made him to insult me
superheronerd:	_plot twist_
FLUBS:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1uTsqJVAeo
SuperGummying:	Ida you are right
SuperGummying:	Hmmmm üòè
Neon Strike Kitty:	You are one of Gummy's alts
SuperGummying:	_runs _
SuperGummying:	Oh no Ida is mad
SuperGummying:	So you can flip out
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm about to blow your mind
Neon Strike Kitty:	Stuck
SuperGummying:	I'm just waiting for someone to be nice to me
SuperGummying:	Right now
superheronerd:	Ah okay. That's a shame, but that's no problemo (:
FLUBS:	eyan is controlled by master. master is mentally unstable and made his own little world.
FLUBS:	you are controlled by eyan
FLUBS:	gummy. you are a bot that controls other bots
FLUBS:	lots of reasons, bella. most of which are a few things that make talking suck for me. at best i would listen in.
SuperGummying:	I don't have 9k bots
FLUBS:	gummy. read the above convo
SuperGummying:	One day
SuperGummying:	I'll prove it
FLUBS:	his grand plan is 9k bots...
SuperGummying:	I don't have a bot
superheronerd:	Why wouldn't you join the vc?
FLUBS:	now i dont understand context and cant answer...
superheronerd:	It was an "in plain sight" sort of deal
FLUBS:	im sorry.
Dragonite:	‡≤†_‡≤†
SuperGummying:	No I'm no bot
FLUBS:	GOD
FLUBS:	MY
FLUBS:	OH
FLUBS:	real...master...
FLUBS:	wait
superheronerd:	Why must you ignore me, stuck
FLUBS:	a mentally unstable man who cannot seperate fantasy from reality.
FLUBS:	eyan himself is a bot under the ultimate bot master.
Master9000:	got it
FLUBS:	You are a bot, second in command under eyan bot
SuperGummying:	Who is most likely a bot of mine?
SuperGummying:	So who's my bot then?
superheronerd:	Whys that, stuck?
SuperDragonite2172:	<@!162952008712716288> Done.  It's in your DMs.
FLUBS:	but he is tasked with upkeep of the bots
Kireina:	He's dumb enough to pay someone off to do it for him though.
willofd2011:	Bless you lol ^w^
Master9000:	that was the initial argument
FLUBS:	gummy is a bot too
FLUBS:	i will never hear your voices most likely, because i will never join the voice chats.
Dragonite:	there's no way gummy's smart enough to make a bot
Dragonite:	i mean, if you think about it
FLUBS:	all the users?
SuperGummying:	I have no bot
superheronerd:	I accept this argument
superheronerd:	Fair enough
FLUBS:	i have not and will not take a bots word for it
superheronerd:	The problem with your theory is that I've heard most of the regulars voices
FLUBS:	the only problem i have with my theory is that ive heard gummy and master's voice and seen eyan's face.
Dragonite:	and it isn't mine
Dragonite:	ahh yes, it's lovely when someone else's bot breaks
FLUBS:	<@!199725993416589313> your bot is broken
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Master9000: SKITTY not again
i cant co back`
FLUBS:	oh cool. master is broken
Master9000:	rgNJA
FLUBS:	have yet to think of a way around it.
Dragonite:	good job
Master9000:	ues
FLUBS:	it still confuses me.
FLUBS:	the other one. not you.
Dragonite:	what did what just do
FLUBS:	so what did dragonite just do?
Dragonite:	idk if it would be worth the effort though
Dragonite:	still thinking of a way to automatically archive the pins
Kireina:	ROFL
Kireina:	to snap pinned messages
Kireina:	When he comes back from the dead
Master9000:	ty
SuperDragonite2172:	<@!162952008712716288> On it, Sir!
FLUBS:	what should that do?
Master9000:	<@218843275824463872> snaps
superheronerd:	Jeez
Dragonite:	rip
EyanSays:	50 pinned messages (in this channel)
FLUBS:	huh.
Dragonite:	e!pinned
Dragonite:	
Master9000:	if you think about it, if you didnt eat your last 25 slices of pizza, you wouldnt be in this exact situation
superheronerd:	Ah, it's alright. Thank you though
FLUBS:	bella i can pm you it, but you may regret it.
superheronerd:	_Slight interest in story, respects mods wish_
Dragonite:	it was some rando
FLUBS:	its a good story...but fine.
Kireina:	Sounds like something gummy would say.
FLUBS:	thats some progressive thinking
Kireina:	Was it gummy
Dragonite:	and we're not talking about the cat story, flubs
Dragonite:	i forget who it was but someone was like "i'll block the bot and then it can't censor me"
FLUBS:	yeah but people need to notice the spam first. or other rule breaking stuff. like my cat story i still really want to tell
Kireina:	and it'll unblock for the instance of the message.
Kireina:	I can literally just click the blocked message
FLUBS:	^
Dragonite:	i feel like it would be counterproductive to be a moderator and block people because then when they start spewing rubbish you'd have no idea
FLUBS:	i mean, if you want some action i can spam, panda.
Kireina:	Actually enjoyable.
superheronerd:	What's peaceful chat like, panda?
FLUBS:	i have not seen them type...why block em?
Master9000:	and i acnt block anyone because im running the draft even tho i can still read blocked messages lul
Master9000:	i have no idea
Kireina:	Yeah I also blocked the blackace person
FLUBS:	i figured it all out
Dragonite:	waht on earth did i just walk in on
superheronerd:	Did you? Gg
FLUBS:	(not even bots)
FLUBS:	nobody deserves blocking.
FLUBS:	rude.
Kireina:	I kinda just blocked him at a certain point lol.
superheronerd:	So far it seems to be successful, as no others are here
FLUBS:	mostly gummy.
FLUBS:	ill create one more bot. with the sole task of destroying then replacing eyan. but this time, ill be able to ban anyone and everyone!
superheronerd:	It's for the cause.
FLUBS:	bella, im sorry. when i take him down you will cease to exist. unless he gave you autonomy. then you can live.
superheronerd:	I hope for your success. Bravery is evident in these actions.
FLUBS:	none of it was ever real...
FLUBS:	the youtube subs...were they bots too
FLUBS:	bella...NO! eyan...i know. you cant hide it. you tried, but i know and ill tell everyone.
superheronerd:	Shhhh
superheronerd:	Stuck, this must remain a secret
FLUBS:	but he cant
FLUBS:	hes been trying to stop me
FLUBS:	he knows ive figured it out
FLUBS:	thats why he hasnt streamed
FLUBS:	he thinks im a bot too so he doesnt say anything
FLUBS:	oh god
FLUBS:	eyan needed one to make it seem more real!
superheronerd:	_x files music in the background_
FLUBS:	gummy is the bad guy
FLUBS:	these are all bots
FLUBS:	thats it
FLUBS:	his true account...IS EYAN!
SuperGummying:	Fine I'll get ida then
FLUBS:	he went over the deep end and made a bunch of bots...
superheronerd:	_looks at music history. Sees alt music. OH NO ITS TRUE_
FLUBS:	gummy is alone here. nobody else is real.
Master9000:	_alt+f4's_
FLUBS:	did...did i stumble upon the fevered dream of a madman?
Kireina:	I'd end my own existence if that was the case.
FLUBS:	youre a no good, stinking alt!
superheronerd:	_are we all alts?_
FLUBS:	you...youre an alt!
FLUBS:	oh god. thats it.
FLUBS:	bella...are you an alt?
superheronerd:	The amount of extra effort this entails already makes me tired
FLUBS:	its the long con. he isnt really stupid. he just isnt stable so he can act it
Kireina:	He doesn't have the mental capacity for that anyways :^|
FLUBS:	take your pick
FLUBS:	its a refrence. someone made it for him.
Kireina:	You're dumb if you think he can create a name like/would create a name like Regal Swan :^|
FLUBS:	oh no. he got panda :0
FLUBS:	sure they arent man. i believe you. winks
Kireina:	Regal isn't anyways.
FLUBS:	sure
SuperGummying:	We talked about this

Dragonite:	brb getting food
Dragonite:	man, i cant think of any ways for THAT to go wrong
FLUBS:	also... alts cant be wingmen
FLUBS:	hmmm
SuperGummying:	Fine I'll go ask bunni or regal to be my wingman
FLUBS:	*fails to capture pokemon*
FLUBS:	pokemon wont reject me.
FLUBS:	its more fun
FLUBS:	^^^ i do that
Dragonite:	the wingman's advice is to go crawl into a refrigerator and play DS games
Master9000:	"guys listen to my dating advice i have a 100 on the purity test" -Gummy
Kireina:	Also, if you have to rely on a wingman it's already gone south.
SuperGummying:	In my case it's Dragonite
Kireina:	I don't need to, in order to know it's garbage.
SuperGummying:	Also make sure to have a wingman
SuperGummying:	It's a great idea
superheronerd:	Unless it's like one of those dinner and a movie things
SuperGummying:	Panda you never read my dating advice
FLUBS:	if it even does.
FLUBS:	gets you a point off on the purity test i guess.
superheronerd:	more interest in seeing the movie than the person lmao
FLUBS:	no talking, dark room. hand holding max.
Kireina:	At the very least you gain absolutely nothing out of it.
FLUBS:	^
Kireina:	I thought we established that going to a movie on the first date was a horrendous idea.
FLUBS:	***antitackle activated. tackle dodged. counterslap deployed***
SuperGummying:	_tackles stuck _
FLUBS:	thats my new anti slap program
FLUBS:	***antislap activated. slap dodged. counterslap deployed***
SuperGummying:	_slaps stuck _

SuperGummying:	I'll buy you a ticket
SuperGummying:	Wanna come and watch Dunkirk with me again?
SuperGummying:	Master

FLUBS:	oh hey i didnt miss a stream tonight! bitter sweet!

Master9000:	they do know
SuperGummying:	And war
SuperGummying:	People need to know about the beaches
Master9000:	relevant meme
SuperGummying:	I would take her to see Dunkirk again
FLUBS:	3.
SuperGummying:	Nah if I had a date
Neon Strike Kitty:	As long as it takes her to realize what movie this is
SuperGummying:	Thanks Ida for the encouragement üòë
Master9000:	picoseconds*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seconds
SuperGummying:	3 hours?
FLUBS:	3.
SuperGummying:	3?
FLUBS:	3
SuperGummying:	How fast would I lose her?
SuperGummying:	I should find a date and take her to the movies with me
FLUBS:	that and the sexual tension between the two main characters was palpable. so much so i expected the female lead(jailbreak) to come out as gay.
superheronerd:	My ability to withstand puns in succession is at a max of five
SuperGummying:	Hmmm
FLUBS:	it was physically painful
FLUBS:	the amount of parent groaning i heard at the puns HURT
superheronerd:	Those poor people forced to watch it, I pity them
FLUBS:	^
superheronerd:	Purely on that, and children.
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	I was going to buy you popcorn
Dragonite:	like, this movie is actually making money because people are seeing it just to witness the awfulness
FLUBS:	it *ahem* trancended words *ahem*

Master9000:	thank you, it means a lot
Kireina:	Unless he just happens to be referencing someone, but I highly doubt it >_>
Kireina:	:^|
Kireina:	I was mainly referring to Dragonoob.
Dragonite:	The S is for "Annoying"
Kireina:	That is in fact how you spell Sebastian.
Neon Strike Kitty:	What's the S for, though?
SuperGummying:	kk
superheronerd:	You're my new fave singer <@!162952008712716288>

Kireina:	I think she's referring to the misspell >_>
superheronerd:	My reception is bad in this area. I'll listen in a bit üòé which is probably a horrible idea
Dragonite:	i think he was a saint or something
Neon Strike Kitty:	wtf is Sebastain?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Drago
Kireina:	In the name of all that is holy, don't do this to yourself LOL
Master9000:	this ear rape https://soundcloud.com/user-92773758/eardrum-warriors
Dragonite:	because ida is the one who started the Sebastain thing

Dragonite:	what do you expect me to do with this
SuperGummying:	_gives dragonite fried chicken_
Dragonite:	hmm
SuperGummying:	thats making a fool out of yourself
SuperGummying:	dragonoob
Dragonite:	youre imagining things
SuperGummying:	i mean you did make a fool out of yourself
Dragonite:	because if the win condition is "to make the biggest fool out of oneself" i dont think i want to win
SuperGummying:	let me think
SuperGummying:	idk
Dragonite:	exactly what is the win condition
SuperGummying:	dragonite this provoking game will end with a Gumlin victory
Dragonite:	‡≤†_‡≤†
SuperGummying:	ha i used dragonite's faces to my advantage
SuperGummying:	¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

SuperGummying:	bad
SuperGummying:	no
Master9000:	_noms notes_
SuperGummying:	_takes notes_

SuperGummying:	oh alright
Master9000:	depends on preference, i have 80
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know, I have mine set to 60.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Set a maximum framerate.
SuperGummying:	to 60 or 80?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Really, you should cap it.
SuperGummying:	thats what all the websites tell me
SuperGummying:	nah it was suppose to be around 100+
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Master9000: if it falls to 25% of what it was you SKITTYed it up pretty badly`
Master9000:	fps is an indicator not a measure of the strength of your graphics card
SuperGummying:	good enough
SuperGummying:	so i was like meh
SuperGummying:	it was around 100+
SuperGummying:	well i mean after awhile
Neon Strike Kitty:	Maybe there's a reason
Dragonite:	\:thinking\:
Dragonite:	well maybe you shoudl listen to everyone
SuperGummying:	everyone tells me that lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	I kind of think you should cap your fps
SuperGummying:	league went over 400+ fps
Neon Strike Kitty:	(I'm supposed to be participating in a tourney on League tomorrow, don't know if I have time)
SuperGummying:	yup new graphics card works well
Neon Strike Kitty:	Your computer's better?
SuperGummying:	wanna play tomorrow btw?
Neon Strike Kitty:	We should both have a lower difficulty then
SuperGummying:	since i'll know what i'll be doing next time
SuperGummying:	ida i challenge you to an offical rematch when this is over
Neon Strike Kitty:	The cities leave your empire only if you have the wrong ideology, but that didn't happen yet
Necro:	Again
SuperGummying:	i guess
SuperGummying:	oh
SuperGummying:	i was doom from that start when i chose emperor
Neon Strike Kitty:	and have a popular ideology when that comes around
Neon Strike Kitty:	Just gotta build like colosseums and circuses and have your workers work any luxury resources you get
SuperGummying:	_waves üè≥ at ida_
Necro:	Well my stage 4 duskblade just went completely terminal after hearing master's 'song'
SuperGummying:	.....
Kireina:	Yes
SuperGummying:	wait really?
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's actually a thing that happens in Civ
SuperGummying:	ida if that happens im doing plan z
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~with any luck the unhappiness will get too much and the cities join my empire without a fight~~
SuperGummying:	but i never promise that back üòõ
SuperGummying:	ida promise not to attack me
Kireina:	Like it's expected to be
SuperGummying:	yup so i needed help
Kireina:	Good
Neon Strike Kitty:	and his empire was kind of descending into violence and anarchy
SuperGummying:	so she is helping
Neon Strike Kitty:	I had enough of it to go around
SuperGummying:	idk how to play
SuperGummying:	nah
Kireina:	A mistake on her part, really.
SuperGummying:	she was trying to save my empire
SuperGummying:	ida did give me gold
SuperGummying:	i mean
Necro:	Let there be anarchy
SuperGummying:	that face taunts me so much
SuperGummying:	because dragonite
Kireina:	You're just improving his doomed city at that point.
SuperGummying:	i hate this ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Neon Strike Kitty:	¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Kireina:	leave him be
SuperGummying:	you had high rank command
SuperGummying:	you are like a marshal
Kireina:	What's the point
Kireina:	He's the emperor of 1 person and it's himself
SuperGummying:	ida what is this
Dragonite:	i vote no hitting Ida with bats
SuperGummying:	no bad
SuperGummying:	_hits ida with a bat_
Neon Strike Kitty:	*overthrows the empire to form a democratic nation*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*rebels*
SuperGummying:	im already an emperor
SuperGummying:	yeah i can't
Kireina:	"minster"
Kireina:	or in this case
Kireina:	Gummy would never be able to pass off as a minister.
SuperGummying:	i only have $20 on me
Dragonite:	yes
SuperGummying:	how much?
Dragonite:	_fines Gummy_
Dragonite:	that's table abuse, minster
SuperGummying:	(„Éé‡≤†–î‡≤†)„ÉéÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
Necro:	Any disagreements will be ignored due to them being primary arguments that people should be tested before procreating
Necro:	And shows that the world is going in a downward spiral
Necro:	The fact that it was created is a crime against humanity
Necro:	No just no the emoji movie is bad and should never exist
SuperGummying:	and movie
SuperGummying:	and snacks
SuperGummying:	popcorn
SuperGummying:	but but

Necro:	No as I said I was looking for a reaction and a conversation starter and that was it
Dragonite:	post it in Woe
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well, it's probably not censored anyways, but
Dragonite:	what was it?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, I'm not gonna let censor dodging fly

Deino Mite:	these streams are becoming incredibly inconsistant
SuperGummying:	ida welcome back
Neon Strike Kitty:	Heyah
SuperGummying:	That's fine Eyan if you see this. Get some rest and you can stream again when you can  üòÉ
SuperGummying:	_rolls out _
SuperGummying:	_waves _
Kugallyblitz:	hello gummy
SuperGummying:	_rolls into blitz _
SuperDragonite2172:	Sonanoka~
Kugallyblitz:	being tired is tiring
willofd2011:	And I'm doing good thank you ^w^
willofd2011:	That's good well aside from being tired anyways lol
Kugallyblitz:	im doing very well today, tired kinda, and you?
willofd2011:	How are you doing ^w^
Kugallyblitz:	hai will
willofd2011:	Hi blitz ^w^
Kugallyblitz:	things today are going very well so far, how bout you?
SuperDragonite2172:	How goes things?
Kugallyblitz:	Howdy super dragonite
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Kugal.
Kugallyblitz:	Hai all
SuperDragonite2172:	Later, Squid.
SquidofBaconator:	Well, that's my mini-rant for the day. Got to go to work...
SquidofBaconator:	It gets annoying with all the debates over "Console Peasants" and "PC Master Race" people. They both have their pros and cons, shut the f--- up
SquidofBaconator:	I find console gaming to be more comfortable than PC gaming. That and I don't really care for the keyboard/mouse as a controller
SuperGummying:	Gummy worms
FLUBS:	yeah, it used to be so fun. for some reason valve decided to go short term profit with it...destroyed the game and pretended to care üò¶
SquidofBaconator:	It wasn't bad, I just had no interest in it
SquidofBaconator:	I got rid of Steam because I never used it; I rarely played TF2
FLUBS:	it sucked when i uninstalled. volvo just ate the game
FLUBS:	tf2 is great. i have over 3k hours.
SquidofBaconator:	I don't think gummy bear pie would be very good...
FLUBS:	it can be funny sometimes. the groups i get invited to are called blah blah csgo case site blah blah random group of numbers blah
SquidofBaconator:	The only game I really played is TF2
SuperGummying:	_gives Dragonite gummy pie_
SquidofBaconator:	I never played CS:GO either. I'm not a pc gamer
FLUBS:	then they unfriended and blocked me when i asked them to "stop spamming please i just asked how your day was."
FLUBS:	lol they said hello, then copy pasted a series of codes for csgo sites. have never touched csgo.
SquidofBaconator:	Have fun. Lol
FLUBS:	oh brb gonna go mess with a scammer who added me on steam!
SquidofBaconator:	I like chocolate-peanut butter pie best
Master9000:	unless the pie is entirely made of chocolate, cake is better
FLUBS:	very excited. cant wait. watching twitch. time is stopped i guess because it has been 10 seconds since i checked my watch. but im sure its been at least 15 minutes
SquidofBaconator:	I'm just getting ready for work tonight
SquidofBaconator:	Idk, I like both cake and pie
FLUBS:	I am currently in the middle of hyping myself.
Dragonite:	but cake is better
SuperDragonite2172:	Guess you're just catching it during the lull.
FLUBS:	*everyone instantly starts typing*
Dragonite:	especially pizza pie
Master9000:	and the other half you have no idea what hell is unleashed
Dragonite:	i like pie
SquidofBaconator:	Seems like half the time I come back to Discord, everyone is done chatting üòõ
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	I'm doing nothing
willofd2011:	That's good ^w^
SuperDragonite2172:	Doing well.
willofd2011:	So how is everyone doing today ^w^
SuperGummying:	Hey will
willofd2011:	Hi lucky and thank you ^w^
Luckyskarm:	Grats will
willofd2011:	Hi master lol ^w^
Master9000:	gonna take some tiem to get used to will being red-orange lol
willofd2011:	Hi dragonite hi gummy ^w^
SuperGummying:	https://youtu.be/UpsKGvPjAgw
SuperGummying:	So you're this?
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Aqua.
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Will.
willofd2011:	Hi aqua ^w^
Aqua:	Hey Will
willofd2011:	Hai friends ^w^
Aqua:	I'm unintentionally Mr. Steal-Yo-Girl
Aqua:	I'm beginning to realize
Kireina:	<@!128672344624463872> If you wanted to be head maid earlier you coulda just asked :^)
SuperGummying:	Ida get me down pls
Master9000:	hes gonna fall asleep and forget hes up there
SuperGummying:	Hey get me down
Dragonite:	just leave 'im there
Animal_Man_:	*sigh*
Animal_Man_:	*pins gummy to the ceiling mid jump*
SuperGummying:	She probably didn't feel a thing
SuperGummying:	She probably won't wake up
SuperGummying:	I don't weigh that much
Master9000:	umm
SuperGummying:	_jumps on ida _
Dragonite:	she's dead, Jim
Dragonite:	_pokes ida_
Neon Strike Kitty:	*falls asleep*
SuperGummying:	Hmm nothing on my Pokemon go radar
Dragonite:	see <#311409240327585802>
SquidofBaconator:	Yes, he said it was "Ridiculously cute"
SuperGummying:	Is it cute though?
Dragonite:	_pokes dog_
SuperDragonite2172:	üêï
Dragonite:	hmm
Dragonite:	unless she's dead
Dragonite:	it's ridiculously cute
Dragonite:	also i have a dog sleeping on the floor behind me
Dragonite:	do you know how much chat flood that would involve
Master9000:	from a certain point of view
SuperDragonite2172:	Not if it lists how many are in each channel.
SuperGummying:	_starts to tap dance _
Dragonite:	that would be less informative
Neon Strike Kitty:	üòõ
Master9000:	e!serverpinned
Dragonite:	Good
EyanSays:	47 pinned messages (in this channel)
Dragonite:	e!pinned
SuperGummying:	Aw
Master9000:	he servermuted me while i sang
SuperGummying:	I think lol
SuperGummying:	Hey Dragonite you like the singing
Animal_Man_:	*pins gummy to tack board*
Dragonite:	if you value your ears, dont
Neon Strike Kitty:	No thanks
SuperGummying:	He posted in creative
SuperGummying:	Ida you should listen to master sing
SuperGummying:	It's probably because you have two songs sang while he has one
Neon Strike Kitty:	Meanwhile I'm listening to my mom sing along to a disc by Rammstein
SuperGummying:	I still believe your singing is better than master's singing but only by a tiny bit
SuperGummying:	Hey Dragonite
SuperGummying:	_slaps Dragonite _
Dragonite:	it's okay, i pin all the stupid stuff that we say, too
SuperGummying:	Oh if only I pin you guys
Dragonite:	e!pinned works as soon as i restart the bot
Dragonite:	thinking about how an e!archive would work
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	
SuperGummying:	Keyword wisely
SuperGummying:	You must use pin wisely
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you can't though
SuperDragonite2172:	e!archive
SuperDragonite2172:	Or you could make that a command for Skarm.
SuperDragonite2172:	Don't forget I can always archive the pins.
Dragonite:	but i really want to
SuperGummying:	Yeah don't pin me every 5 minutes
Dragonite:	Let's see if I can remember how to use the fetch() method(s)
JelloHammer:	So pin wisely, lest you be rendered pinless at your most vulnerable moment.
Dragonite:	Interesting
JelloHammer:	We're at 46.
SuperDragonite2172:	Per channel.
Dragonite:	Fifty pins
SuperDragonite2172:	Yup.
JelloHammer:	There's a limit?
SuperGummying:	Elitist
Dragonite:	then i could make an e!pins command or something and we'd know how close we are to the limit
Dragonite:	i wonder if there's a discord API method for counting pins
JelloHammer:	Which word?
SuperGummying:	I don't even know what that word means but yeah!
Neon Strike Kitty:	It felt kind of elitist with the way it used to be
JelloHammer:	With all these pins, why aren't you leaking yet
Master9000:	i like the relatively in there
Dragonite:	i removed it because i want the concentration of stupid in the pins to be relatively lower than it used to be
Master9000:	lmao
Neon Strike Kitty:	Was not even a second of delay
JelloHammer:	You just had to say it
SuperGummying:	üò±
SuperDragonite2172:	PFFFFT!
SuperGummying:	_claps _
Dragonite:	
SuperGummying:	Wow for once Dragonite not pinning me
Dragonite:	
JelloHammer:	I feel like the extra button that comes with a shirt
Dragonite:	<@!116347313080762372>
JelloHammer:	Also, is Panda still head maid, or can I be promoted?
Dragonite:	"that's what she said"
 - literally everybody in high school
JelloHammer:	Question: What is the most overused quote you've seen in any medium?
SuperDragonite2172:	Rude.
SuperGummying:	_steps on Dragonite _
Dragonite:	_lies down on the floor_
Dragonite:	that reminds me, i should be game jamming
JelloHammer:	If you want chemistry, visit this dude: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheThoisoi2/videos
Dragonite:	that's a lot of chemistry
JelloHammer:	You know what's even funnier than stealing someone's video and reacting to it for money? The guy who compiles like 10 reactions into one video.
SquidofBaconator:	Go play outside Jello...
Dragonite:	that wasnt even good. go home
JelloHammer:	REACTION MASHUP
JelloHammer:	If there are these many reactions, does that make this a
SquidofBaconator:	I like bacon
SquidofBaconator:	And now the reactions are going wild
Master9000:	oh rip
SuperDragonite2172:	Yup. >_<;
JelloHammer:	I think that someone just reacted to the wrong one like three times
SuperDragonite2172:	What Ida said.
Master9000:	there was one reaction lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Or just missed a lot
Dragonite:	someone's having fun with the reactions
Dragonite:	_flings tangerines at ida_
Neon Strike Kitty:	Delicious
Neon Strike Kitty:	I do like tangerines, though
JelloHammer:	Ca(OH)2  +  CO2 ==> CaCO3 (Marble) + H2O
SquidofBaconator:	You're still Dragonoob üòõ
JelloHammer:	Lime = Ca(OH)2
JelloHammer:	But
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd die
Dragonite:	aww, you changed it back
Neon Strike Kitty:	No
JelloHammer:	If I pump carbon dioxide into you, will you turn to marble? <@!141255588846895105>
Dragonite:	_gets allergic_
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I guess
Dragonite:	_pokes cats_
SquidofBaconator:	Dragonoob?
Neon Strike Kitty:	except cats
Neon Strike Kitty:	But I don't like anything much
SuperDragonite2172:	Citrus is good.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not particularly
SquidofBaconator:	Do you like limes? Lol
Dragonite:	you should have made it t!ime and seen if it took longer for people to notice
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because it looks similar to time
regal swan:	y lime?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Good job
SuperDragonite2172:	I also noticed, I just didn't speak up.
Dragonite:	i noticed a long time ago, silly
Neon Strike Kitty:	You noticed
Dragonite:	_sprinkles water on schala - guru of limestone_

Neon Strike Kitty:	Dragoni
Dragonite:	at least make it clever will you
SuperGummying:	Dragonfool
Dragonite:	I like this one better actually
Dragonite:	
SuperGummying:	It's dragonut
JelloHammer:	Dargonit
SuperDragonite2172:	~~Dargontie~~
Dragonite:	when exactly was there politics ahppening
SuperGummying:	_yells at Dragonite _
SuperGummying:	Also number 4
Dragonite:	„ÉΩ( ÔΩ° „ÉÆÔæü)„Éé
Dragonite:	meaningful convesation, that's what
JelloHammer:	What isn't happening in this chat is the better question.
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Krelian.
Dragonite:	that's a question we ask ourselves each and every day
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Lord Krelian: what. the. SKITTY. is going on in this chat`
SuperGummying:	God Damn it
JelloHammer:	Whether emotes are annoying or not, I think we can all agree that spamming them is the antithesis of a meaningful conversation.
SuperDragonite2172:	~~e!tongard~~
Dragonite:	Who?
SuperGummying:	_slaps Dragonite _
Dragonite:	i refuse to spell my name right
Dragonite:	no
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's just a late response
SuperGummying:	_rolls out _
Dragonite:	
SuperDragonite2172:	Indeed it did.
SuperGummying:	Number 3 Dragonite spell your name right
Dragonite:	that came out of nowhere
SuperGummying:	Number 2 yay ida didn't burn me
SuperGummying:	Number 1 I'm not a spammer
Neon Strike Kitty:	Emotes annoy me in the same way that "dank memes" do
JelloHammer:	If you don't get it you're seen as a pleb (or in Forsen's case a new***)
JelloHammer:	And is even streamer specific
Neon Strike Kitty:	thing is, they tend to be treated like inside jokes that everyone gets
JelloHammer:	This is especially so in the Hearthstone community
SuperDragonite2172:	That's a good way to put it, Ida.
JelloHammer:	Pretty much
Neon Strike Kitty:	emotes are mostly just inside jokes, I feel
JelloHammer:	I can never use an EleGiggle without thinking of Reynad
JelloHammer:	After spending so much time on twitch (and especially hearthstone) I'm probably not gonna be able to shake off emotes.
Dragonite:	i go out of my way to avoid emotes and emoji
Dragonite:	emoticons at least require a little bit of creativity to interpret, so they annoy me the least
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't even know what most emotes are supposed to convey
Dragonite:	_flops into home_
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Master9000: they feel more human and fun than yellow balls of apple SKITTYery`
JelloHammer:	Emotes are mindless
But some form of shared madness I suppose
Neon Strike Kitty:	Or your talk about cancer.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not gonna go off on a rant about emotes now.
Master9000:	my order of preference is emote>emoticon>cancer>death>emoji
SuperDragonite2172:	Ôºà‚ÄêÔºæ‚ñΩÔºæ‚ÄêÔºâ
SuperDragonite2172:	And those are the ones I tend to use.
Neon Strike Kitty:	The emoticons are the ones that annoy me the least
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
JelloHammer:	üòÄ   <-- This is an emoji
: )  <-- This is an emoticon
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>  <-- This is an emote
SuperDragonite2172:	I was figuring that they were updating Tatsu to use the newest API in preparation for the eventual Discord update.
SuperDragonite2172:	I guess my theory was wrong then.
Master9000:	this shit?
Neon Strike Kitty:	By frequently, you mean constantly, right?
SuperDragonite2172:	Also I have a theory as to why Tatsu has been down so frequently.
SuperDragonite2172:	For the record, I do consider "emojis" and "emoticons" different things.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Emojis kind of annoy me
SuperDragonite2172:	Honestly, I don't use very many emojis myself.
Animal_Man_:	I mean, I was optimistic because I thought movies like inside out were gonna be bad but ended up being great
Animal_Man_:	LOL
EyanSays:	Potty mouth!
`Lord Krelian: i already voiced my opinion that this is a SKITTYing stupid idea for a movie`
FLUBS:	its up to 3%

FLUBS:	pants are an outside dog
FLUBS:	good.
Dragonite:	My pants are now outside
FLUBS:	just in the pants tho, no where important, right?
Dragonite:	_forcefully kicks himself in the pants all the way out the door_
Dragonite:	@ the "bad" part, not the other one
Dragonite:	probably
FLUBS:	its gonna be so sick
FLUBS:	is it bad that I can't wait to see the emoji movie tonight?
Dragonite:	_tries unsuccessfully to prise his fingers from the keybaord_
Dragonite:	that's like 80% of the fun though
Neon Strike Kitty:	If it was just "imma do it for you" then it would be fine
Dragonite:	okay NOW time to e!dragonite for a while
Dragonite:	it's like saying "you really should have the capacity to look this information up yourself but you dont so imma do it for you"
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not seeing the problem?
Master9000:	i thought that was the whole point
Animal_Man_:	EXACTLY
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's very condescending
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmgtfy is kind of an asshole response tho
EyanSays:	Go play outside, Dragonite.
Dragonite:	time to e!dragonite for a while
Dragonite:	sure
Dragonite:	heh
Crow_Songs:	and dragonite dm me if you have more questions i won't be on here too much

Master9000:	oh hi crow
Crow_Songs:	it should've been
Dragonite:	no
Master9000:	was that a pun?
Dragonite:	Stupid phone
Dragonite:	Sounds
Dragonite:	Ok sound's boring
Master9000:	althought images might throw it off a bit unless you already dont record those in the log to use for this
regal swan:	yo peep are awake
Master9000:	yeah
Dragonite:	what, for analyzing chat lines or something?
Master9000:	and i was thinking that based on this shit https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/ <@!137336478291329024>
Master9000:	well if nobody else talks then everyone will have read this part

Dragonite:	That's literally my name on the Serebii forums because I misspelled it on the signup sheet
Animal_Man_:	The dragon tie
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah, if only I could change your nickname <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	>Dragontie
SuperDragonite2172:	No, being able to word good is over-rated.
Rainy:	wqm3
Dragonite:	spelling is overated
SuperDragonite2172:	Do you even spelling, Dragonite?
Rainy:	*yells at Dragonite for shouting at Ida*
Dragonite:	I think I misspelled my name again
Dragonite:	_yells at Ida for being too lazy to yell at Dragontie_
Dragonite:	also
Dragonite:	also the bot hugging hugs isn't a bug, it's hilarious
Dragonite:	for what
Master9000:	<@!137336478291329024> could you try to make something of that sort or is that just too crazy
Master9000:	Isn't there some repetition compression algorithm which is also used by computers to zip files and give a compression percentage?
Animal_Man_:	tru
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't wanna be part of that mob mentality
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well Gummy gets burned enough by literally anyone else
SquidofBaconator:	Whaaaaaaaat?!
Animal_Man_:	Someone trying to burn someone who isn't gummy?
Animal_Man_:	what is this
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~the only spammer here is Master~~
SuperDragonite2172:	~~*shot*~~
SuperDragonite2172:	~~Does he eat Honeycomb?~~
Animal_Man_:	Gummy just has a big mouth
Animal_Man_:	When I think of spamer I think of someone who says the same thing over and over
Animal_Man_:	I mean, idk
Animal_Man_:	XD
SuperDragonite2172:	~~Yes.~~
Animal_Man_:	Gummy?
Animal_Man_:	wait
SquidofBaconator:	Lol
SuperDragonite2172:	Pffft.
SquidofBaconator:	I don't know any spammer üòâ
SuperDragonite2172:	Oh yea.
Neon Strike Kitty:	He has a higher rank
SuperDragonite2172:	There's also the spammer, but he doesn't count.
Animal_Man_:	Yeah that's what I meant by barring the higher ranks
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's some enlightened and staff that are red gaoler
Animal_Man_:	guess I'm 18
SquidofBaconator:	I'm only level 16
SuperDragonite2172:	I'm getting close to Red Gaoler as well.
SquidofBaconator:	I saw that
Animal_Man_:	Also, not sure if you saw, but Will made it to lvl 30 last night, which I think means she's the only red tier person on this chat (barring people with higher ranks)
Animal_Man_:	lol
SquidofBaconator:	üòõ
SquidofBaconator:	That just makes things more confusing than they should be
SuperDragonite2172:	I mean I guess she is in a way since I'm Dragonite's shadow?
Animal_Man_:	lol
SuperDragonite2172:	Yet...
SuperDragonite2172:	Ida hasn't yelled at me.
SuperDragonite2172:	The guru I would assume.
Animal_Man_:	And which dragonite?
wolverale12:	Why would you yell at him?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Heyah
wolverale12:	what?
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Ida.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Too lazy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dragonite, I can't be bothered to yell at you
wolverale12:	lol
Animal_Man_:	nvm lol
Animal_Man_:	oh wait
Animal_Man_:	147 I think
SquidofBaconator:	119
wolverale12:	I got 48 currently even though I haven't uploaded in forever and I upload rarely xP
wolverale12:	How many subs do you have btw
SquidofBaconator:	That's what most people would like
Animal_Man_:	But it may come to that
Animal_Man_:	I'd rather see youtube get fixed then move platforms
SuperDragonite2172:	True.
Animal_Man_:	I mean I would rath YouTube get their crap together then have someone else compete
SuperDragonite2172:	*shot*
SuperDragonite2172:	A firewall.
SquidofBaconator:	Lol
SquidofBaconator:	We're going to build a wall around YouTube
wolverale12:	oh god...
Animal_Man_:	#MakeYouTubeGreatAgain
SquidofBaconator:	BetterTube
SquidofBaconator:	I'm surprised no one has come up and tried to actually compete
SuperDragonite2172:	~~BetterYouTube~~
Animal_Man_:	Like, I love youtube so much, and I try not hate on them for sport, like some do, but even I hate what's going on with youtube, and wish someone with a lot of money could just hurry up and make youtube 2
SquidofBaconator:	I really wish someone else could compete with YouTube. But every time a new video site like Vid.me comes up and people start focusing more on it, it isn't able to compete and people forget about it
Animal_Man_:	i feel you
SuperDragonite2172:	I don't doubt it.
SquidofBaconator:	I'm really annoyed right now...
SquidofBaconator:	After years of bull copyright strikes on many people and many people calling out the system, they STILL haven't fixed their broken system. I linked the video in the Creative tab, if you feel like it, you can see that my video is fair use.
SuperDragonite2172:	I've been having 400 issues with it way too often.
SuperDragonite2172:	YouTube is broken.
SuperDragonite2172:	Vent away.
SquidofBaconator:	I just need to vent on this
SquidofBaconator:	Sorry for going on so much
SquidofBaconator:	Man, I can't stop thinking of this copyright situation. I really wish YouTube actually fixed their f---ing stupid system
SuperDragonite2172:	They're really good in my opinion.
SuperDragonite2172:	I really like this guy's remixes.
SuperDragonite2172:	Wily's Castle 1 from Megaman 2 if I recall.
SuperDragonite2172:	Well there is a Megaman track in it.
wolverale12:	Yeah sounds more like megaman to me since I don't really listen to michael jackson much xP
SuperDragonite2172:	Did you try the remix up above by the way?
SuperDragonite2172:	You don't have to like his music.
SuperDragonite2172:	Exactly.
wolverale12:	Come on it's just music
SuperDragonite2172:	Jerks.
wolverale12:	I got threatened in high school once for saying I wasn't a fan of michael jackson after he died
SuperDragonite2172:	I still urge you to give it a try.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-SYihKFVhA
wolverale12:	You wouldn't catch me listening to his music
SuperDragonite2172:	It doesn't have any singing in it.
wolverale12:	I'm not really a fan of him
SuperDragonite2172:	Trust me.
SuperDragonite2172:	It's really good regardless.
wolverale12:	I don't listen to that artist
SuperDragonite2172:	And yes.
SuperDragonite2172:	By the same guy that made the one you just listened to no less.
wolverale12:	michael jackson?
SuperDragonite2172:	I know of a remix that combines a bunch of songs from games together along with an MJ song.
wolverale12:	usually 80s music cheers me up a lot
SuperDragonite2172:	I went with something up beat to help keep your spirits up.
SuperDragonite2172:	Glad you like it.
wolverale12:	that sounds pretty nice
SquidofBaconator:	Morning Regal
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Regal.
regal swan:	yo
SuperDragonite2172:	Fair enough.
SquidofBaconator:	I know. I'm just looking at this from both angles; the positive and negative
SuperDragonite2172:	And a claim isn't as bad as a strike.
SuperDragonite2172:	And Squid, the reason I say you should be fine is because you either get a claim or a strike from what I remember.
SquidofBaconator:	I have my doubts. Especially since I have had claims on videos that were literally just me talking
SuperDragonite2172:	Here's the remix, Wolverale
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYezNxAT-AM
SuperDragonite2172:	I think you should be fine, Squid.
wolverale12:	also interesting music btw
wolverale12:	<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
wolverale12:	EA put a copyright strike on my Sim City video since they didn't want people to see how bad  of a game it was
wolverale12:	oh jeez I hate it when that happens
SquidofBaconator:	Well, I just appealed my 1st copyright claim. Hope I don't get a strike
SuperDragonite2172:	The remix combines these two songs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnYYq41fCjs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbcZmaus6g0
wolverale12:	again sorry looking at twitter atm also xP
wolverale12:	yeah sure
SuperDragonite2172:	Is that a "yes"?
wolverale12:	hmmk
SuperDragonite2172:	I can link you the OSTs first if you want.
SuperDragonite2172:	I didn't play those games either and I still love it.
SuperDragonite2172:	That doesn't mean you still can't enjoy it.
wolverale12:	xD
wolverale12:	my first nintendo "console" was a ds lite
wolverale12:	I'm mainly a pc gamer
wolverale12:	I've never played those games so I wouldn't know the original soundtrack lol
SuperDragonite2172:	How does a crossover remix of Yoshi's Island and Super Metroid sound?
wolverale12:	hmmm I might consider it yeah
wolverale12:	(sorry for the late response was looking at twitter)
SuperDragonite2172:	Are you willing to try listening to a remix?
wolverale12:	I listen to the original versions of the music
wolverale12:	I don't really listen to video game remixes much tbh
SuperDragonite2172:	I forget if I've asked you this, but do you like VGM remixes?
wolverale12:	just finishing a let's play series from my friend
SuperDragonite2172:	What kind of videos did you watch?
SuperDragonite2172:	Good to hear.
wolverale12:	Just had to watch some videos to make me feel better
wolverale12:	nevermind I'm good now
SuperDragonite2172:	I see.
wolverale12:	I'm just so mad right now and annoyed
SuperDragonite2172:	You don't have to say if you don't want to.
SuperDragonite2172:	That's fine, Wolverale.
wolverale12:	not going to say what it's about since I had a rant on another discord server
wolverale12:	**is super annoyed atm**
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings and Salutations, everyone.

Kireina:	My friend had it and gave me his old copy and was telling me about it
willofd2011:	ah
Kireina:	Basically they stopped updating it so they let people who had that transfer over to clip studo paint for free
willofd2011:	probably
Kireina:	They're made by the same company or something
willofd2011:	it wasnt called that when i first got it so im not sure lol
Kireina:	lmfao
Master9000:	good gnikcuf point

SquidofBaconator:	Also, hi Kugal
Dragonite:	btw if anyone wants to watch the "thigns exploding in slow motion" i posted it in meme chat
SquidofBaconator:	It's possible that it's just because of the automatic system, but I'm not sure. I have gotten flagged for copyright for song reviews in the past, even though those past ones didn't have any portion of the song in them
Kugallyblitz:	hai panda
Kireina:	hey kugal
Kugallyblitz:	howdy yall
SuperGummying:	im feeding
Kireina:	I see well that sucks
superheronerd:	YouTube seems like a complicated thing with all of that
SquidofBaconator:	The video I posted today got flagged for copyright and the 1st appeal got rejected. I'm filing another one tomorrow, since I'm not at my computer right now. If it doesn't go through right, then I could get a strike
Dragonite:	<@!116347313080762372>

Kireina:	How come?
SquidofBaconator:	Although, I might be getting my 1st strike soon... üòî

SquidofBaconator:	When I have the time, I make videos for my YouTube channel.
superheronerd:	Ooh
Kireina:	You're at a game jam session? üòÆ
Dragonite:	there's nothing wrong with that right?
Dragonite:	i'm watching videos of things exploding in slow motion while i should be game jamming
superheronerd:	I don't know what I do
SquidofBaconator:	I spend most of my time watching YouTube and playing video games
Deino Mite:	i mean, im probably not going to cuz id rather watch anime and dont have anyone to play with
Kireina:	Idk about that last half of your second statement is necessarily a good thing
Kireina:	... <:Thonk:281612113485627392>
Deino Mite:	and i can stay up late watching anime and playing league
Deino Mite:	what it does mean is i get to listen to anime music without people yelling at me to shut it off
superheronerd:	From high school
superheronerd:	What are friends
Dragonite:	with varying success
Dragonite:	ive tried
SquidofBaconator:	Yeah, me too. I haven't spoken to many of my friends since high school ended

Master9000:	attach it to an external battery and a sound chip and plant it in your sisters room set to go off at a certain time
Deino Mite:	give it to me because im the last PI master
Dragonite:	bonus points if it involves "annoying my sister" 'cause im a mature 21 year old
Master9000:	<@!212257792722075650> is probably the better person to ask for this
Dragonite:	preferably that dont involve money
Master9000:	buy more of them and turn it into a server?
Dragonite:	<@!162952008712716288> got any fun ideas
Dragonite:	the next question is what to do with my Raspberry Pi
Dragonite:	all right so it sooooooounds like AWS should be safely free for skarm bot, at least for a year
SuperGummying:	....
Dragonite:	thank you
SuperGummying:	xbox one controller
Dragonite:	yeah but which is it
SuperGummying:	xbox one
Dragonite:	·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
Dragonite:	one for the xbox, or an xbox one?
SuperGummying:	i have an xbox one
Dragonite:	_takes a controller and flings it at gummy's head_
SuperGummying:	hmmm
Dragonite:	controller is always the answer
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	<@!137336478291329024> `keyboard` XOR `controller` ?
Master9000:	this is how youre supposed to phrase this
Master9000:	gummy watch
Dragonite:	yes
SuperGummying:	keyboard or controller?
SuperGummying:	i wouldn't mind
Dragonite:	_force-feeds Gummy Skyrim_
SuperGummying:	i have skyrim but i forgot how to play
Deino Mite:	because im a pleb
Dragonite:	go play Solitaire or some game that's actually good
Deino Mite:	i dont have skyrim
Dragonite:	go play skyrim or some other game that's actually good
SuperGummying:	i would say yes but....
Master9000:	maybe in like 16 mins
Deino Mite:	anyone want to play some league of legends?
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> ^
Dragonite:	if you normally go into the sky when you die on earth, do you go to the ground when you die in zeal?
Master9000:	unless youre in the kingdom of zeal or something
SuperGummying:	dying is part of life
Dragonite:	id rather not die
SuperGummying:	i rather die in a fire
Dragonite:	that's like saying dying in a fire sounds better than dying by drowning
SuperGummying:	looks better than sausage party
Mee6:	<@335818633030795264>, you just advanced to **level 3** !
RC:	I'm assuming someone was on drugs when they had the idea
Dragonite:	good job IGN
Dragonite:	ooh, the metacritic score is up to 9
Dragonite:	according to the reviews apparently so do a lot of reviewers
Lord Krelian:	Am I the only one who thinks the Emoji Movie is a REALLY stupid idea for a movie?
SuperGummying:	wow my pc went from dark to bright now
Master9000:	<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
Dragonite:	i like this one: http://nypost.com/2017/07/27/emoji-movie-sucks-sadface/
FLUBS:	it is all i need in life
FLUBS:	i need to see sir patrick steward as a pile of poo
FLUBS:	im unironically excited though
FLUBS:	obviously
FLUBS:	0 is the best
FLUBS:	nope
Dragonite:	can reviews go negative
FLUBS:	it may not anymore
FLUBS:	or it did

Master9000:	obligatory reee to that
FLUBS:	and buy five feet of rope
FLUBS:	im getting ready to see the emoji movie tomorrow
SuperGummying:	Quiet today
SuperGummying:	They rip off a fence?
SuperGummying:	Hmmm
RC:	This what I think of being a prime example of how ungrateful a playerbase can really be.
FLUBS:	it was a large area. plenty of room and lots of people working.
FLUBS:	hey, i think if people controlled themselves/their kids all would have been fine
Lord Krelian:	Wow. That's proof that Pokemon Go never should have been SKITTYing made.
FLUBS:	yes. they had a fenced off park.
SuperGummying:	But the chanting "we can't play" was okay in my opinion
SuperGummying:	Okay maybe they shouldn't have thrown stuff
FLUBS:	people got mad, throwing stuff, booing the creators off the stage while they were appologizing
Deino Mite:	Like at a specific location?
FLUBS:	so they held a fest, timed spawns, good pokes, the whole thing. it required a ticket, so people expected good performance. servers didnt work and the lines were 20 minutes to get into nothing.
Deino Mite:	Wait, what festival thing are you talking about?
FLUBS:	yes they paid so they're allowed to be upset, hell i would be if i went to say a concert and they just said "yeah we arent gonna play, goodnight." but...breaking shit and hurting eachother is WAY, ***WAY*** too far.
SuperGummying:	Festival
FLUBS:	you mean the festival or the game?
SuperGummying:	They did pay for it
SuperGummying:	I mean
FLUBS:	^ it is not a safe game, though that isnt inherently the fault of the game
Lord Krelian:	Not to mention the number of accidents it's caused
Lord Krelian:	I dunno......I just really SKITTYing hate fads like that
FLUBS:	oh god that festival thing...jesus that was disgusting...
SuperDragonite2172:	I haven't really followed the fandom that much.
SuperDragonite2172:	Just curious.
SuperDragonite2172:	What has it done?
Lord Krelian:	You know, I hate what Pokemon Go has done to the fanbase.
FLUBS:	did they add back the original tracking? or at least something good? they just took an amazing concept and destroyed it then destroyed the way of keeping the game alive.
SuperGummying:	That's why I play it lots now
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Deino Mite:	Also, I picked up pokemon go for the first time in months and it's changed a lot. It's actually kinda fun again.
Deino Mite:	Doduo is super common
SuperGummying:	Well Ida it's like the only game I still play on mobile
SuperGummying:	Of course blitz
Kugallyblitz:	in all seriousness not really, but that doduo really seemed like you wanted it lmao
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't think it can be called an obsession, but it's not worth spending your time on.
SuperGummying:	Guys do I have a Pokemon go obsession?
Kugallyblitz:	<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
SuperGummying:	That I never caught yes
Kugallyblitz:	screaming for a doduo <:LUL:305559915714576385>
SuperGummying:	Sooo I was screaming
SuperGummying:	Hey never caught it before
Master9000:	~~all that for a long legged two headed pidgey~~
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kugallyblitz:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	No it was this
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~all that for a Rattata~~
Kugallyblitz:	lmao
SuperGummying:	I got my dad to drive me to catch Pokemon and I found one I never caught but he kept driving so the Pokemon may flee so I kept screaming at the Ultra ball to catch it
Kugallyblitz:	the thought of gummy screaming is hilarious
SuperGummying:	Omg I never have scream this loud
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's good ^.^
Deino Mite:	I love SAO abridged!
Dragonite:	soundsl like you had a fun day
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lisbeth: Sir, either tell me your order, or I'll assume it's a knuckle ... sandwich ... with, like, a sword in it.... 
Kirito: ... What? 
Lisbeth: I don't know: when I said "order", I started to think "restaurant", but then I remembered I run a blacksmith shop, and by then it was past the point of no return.... Can I help you?
SuperGummying:	Which are Arkham origins and knights but I may get them in the future
SuperGummying:	2 games that I don't even have
SuperGummying:	I mean yeah you would get 4 games
regal swan:	see hater of fav cartoon in my head i like i must kill them
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wouldn't complain
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well

SuperGummying:	ida how do you know this?
SuperGummying:	yes
SuperGummying:	who who
Kugallyblitz:	lmao
Neon Strike Kitty:	I know who dies in City
SuperGummying:	it's rumour he faked his death
SuperGummying:	well kinda
SuperGummying:	yes
SuperGummying:	not everyone though
SuperGummying:	very close dragonite actaully
Dragonite:	everybody dies
Kugallyblitz:	<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
SuperGummying:	I wanna see if you really do know
SuperGummying:	oooo tell us ida
Kugallyblitz:	I probably wont play it and I was going to look up the ending anyways
Kugallyblitz:	I dont really care
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think I know the ending
SuperGummying:	I don't have knight but I know the ending
SuperGummying:	I'm not going to spoil it
Kugallyblitz:	üòÆ
SuperGummying:	sad ending in arkham knight though
SuperGummying:	oh yeah
Kugallyblitz:	yea
SuperGummying:	batman arkham asylum?
SuperGummying:	?
Kugallyblitz:	I dont know how the asylum games turn out, ending wise
SuperGummying:	I'm still playing through asylum but I would love to get to City soon
SuperGummying:	Oh yeah jumpscares in the lego ones don't scare me
Kugallyblitz:	and yes those were scary compared to the lego one haha
SuperGummying:	and I screamed
SuperGummying:	like Killer Croc jump scared me
Kugallyblitz:	I did, dont remember which one, but I didnt play much of them
SuperGummying:	at times
SuperGummying:	scary
SuperGummying:	now those are really fun
SuperGummying:	ever played the arkham games?
Kugallyblitz:	i loved the violence cos it was funny haha
SuperGummying:	i get to kill henchmen
SuperGummying:	plus violence
SuperGummying:	i just love how good of a game it is
Kugallyblitz:	thats what I loved most
SuperGummying:	however i have not yet played yet
Kugallyblitz:	I love how the games are based off the lego sets
SuperGummying:	I do have the third one
SuperGummying:	because i played the second one more plus the voices
SuperGummying:	i like the second one better
SuperGummying:	while the first one is the one that i first played
SuperGummying:	while for me
Kugallyblitz:	for the nostalgia aspect though
Kugallyblitz:	I like the first one the best
SuperGummying:	One thing I really like in the second one was the jokerm redesign. I think he looks way better in the second and thrid one compared to the first.
Kugallyblitz:	what is a shame is that one day my ps2 just stopped working
Kugallyblitz:	yea
SuperGummying:	which is the same
SuperGummying:	however i use pc
SuperGummying:	I prefer console
Kugallyblitz:	but cool nonetheless
Kugallyblitz:	ds and console versions are very different
Kugallyblitz:	oh yeah I played on ds too
SuperGummying:	however you do fight bane on the ds version
SuperGummying:	i also played it on ds
SuperGummying:	ah
Kugallyblitz:	I played on PS2
Kugallyblitz:	in the heros campaign I should let it be known
SuperGummying:	what did you play it on?
Kugallyblitz:	I never completed the first one but played it up to like second to last level and 8 year old me got stuck and couldn't figure it out
SuperGummying:	but the real reason i was afk was because i forgot lol
SuperGummying:	meh lurking is kinda fun
Kugallyblitz:	I have not played that one
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not one useful to the town, but....
SuperGummying:	blitz ever played the second one?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lurking is a skill too
SuperGummying:	i think it's because of my bad reading skills thats why i don't notice anything
SuperGummying:	i still don't contribute much though
SuperGummying:	thanks ida, i guess
Kugallyblitz:	yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Kind of a quick improvement, too
SuperGummying:	plus his voice didn't fit him
Kugallyblitz:	i know he's op as hell but still would've been cool to see him more
SuperGummying:	he didn't really shine in the second one as well
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're better than you were when you were starting out
Kugallyblitz:	my only complaint about the first game was that bane didnt get to shine much
SuperGummying:	plus i really suck soo yeah
SuperGummying:	it's just because i keep forgetting
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's fine
SuperGummying:	just for a tiny bit though
SuperGummying:	ida i may retire from mafia for a tiny bit after this game
SuperGummying:	only i thing i hated was some characters didn't get big roles
Neon Strike Kitty:	*this one hasn't even ended yet*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wonder what the next mafia game is gonna be....
SuperGummying:	they talk plus it was one single plot
SuperGummying:	but i loved the second one
SuperGummying:	first one was good
Kugallyblitz:	I played the first one absolutely loved it I was like 8 or so lol
SuperGummying:	so im excited to start
SuperGummying:	i never played the third one actually
Master9000:	Ayy he got he correct answer
Kugallyblitz:	ooooh
SuperGummying:	all three of them
Kugallyblitz:	which lego batman gummy?
Master9000:	Oh I thought that was because it timed out the first time I read it
SuperGummying:	well i should re download lego batman
SuperGummying:	wow
Kugallyblitz:	thats like the biggest pet peeve ever
RC:	damn
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I think if I cancel the download it has to start over

Master9000:	pref pm's
SuperDragonite2172:	Care to name-drop it?
Lord Krelian:	There actually is a Discord server that I'm in that isn't technically Touhou-based, but, like, 80% of the ppl in there are Touhou fans.
SuperDragonite2172:	It is nice to see another Touhou fan aside from a Touhou-based Discord server.
SuperDragonite2172:	Okay.
SuperDragonite2172:	Oh.
Lord Krelian:	I actually don't even have Jackbox myself, so I can only actually play it if someone's streaming it on Twitch.
SuperDragonite2172:	You want me to see if I can get the codes for you?
Lord Krelian:	No, I did not, actually.
SuperDragonite2172:	Anyway, did you know that there are two Touhou Quiplash packs that were made?
SuperDragonite2172:	He's having a logic flaw.
SuperDragonite2172:	Don't mind Mee.
Lord Krelian:	oh hi Mee6
Mee6:	<@298931709963927553>, you just advanced to **level 12** !
Lord Krelian:	Yeah, I was not expecting anyone to get the reference
SuperDragonite2172:	üëç
Lord Krelian:	I was playing a game of Jackbox in a Twitch channel yesterday. On Round 3 of Quiplash, the question was to complete a comic where a guy asks a ghost "Why do you haunt us?", and you have to fill in the ghost's answer. My answer was "Yuyuko Saigyouji made me do it". Cue a whole bunch of Touhou fans coming out of lurk mode as soon as everyone's answers pop up.
SuperDragonite2172:	Hmm?
Lord Krelian:	You know what's funny?
SuperDragonite2172:	The lore behind it is interesting at least.
SuperDragonite2172:	*shrug*
Lord Krelian:	I never understood why Magikarp is such a fan-favorite Pokemon.
FLUBS:	either way everyone knows that the first result is the only correct one. what is the first picture there?
FLUBS:	those are birds dummies
SuperDragonite2172:	That a *fishy* claim.
FLUBS:	only one is magic karp
Lord Krelian:	Yeah, there are a lot of fish Pokemon
FLUBS:	nope
SuperDragonite2172:	Quilfish?
SuperDragonite2172:	What about Feebas and Basculin among others?
Master9000:	hmmmm
FLUBS:	there are no other fish pokemon
FLUBS:	i have the magic karp
FLUBS:	no
Master9000:	isnt milotic also a magic fish?

FLUBS:	"blackomen isnt always bad news" I DISAGREE!
SuperGummying:	Kk
KingofZeal:	If I streamed tomorrow, it'd not be Emerald

SuperGummying:	<@!304073163669766158> will there be a stream tomorrow then? Or just Friday and Saturday now?
Master9000:	i got past this part a while ago the first time i started but then i procrastinated doing this and got a new comp with new storage drives so im just restarting completely

SquidofBaconator:	Hello Stuck
FLUBS:	*rolls in like gummy, but better*
SquidofBaconator:	And it looks like everyone left when I strolled in üòõ
SquidofBaconator:	I'm here now.
SuperGummying:	_falls and passes out _
Master9000:	Oof
Dragonite:	_sticks his foot out and sends gummy flying_
Dragonite:	is that so
SuperGummying:	_rolls in _
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Ida.
SuperDragonite2172:	His LPs have a unique style to them in my opinion.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hey
Lord Krelian:	Yep, him.
SuperDragonite2172:	NakaTeleeli, yes.
Lord Krelian:	Oh, would you have thought I was talking about Naka, as in the LPer?
SuperDragonite2172:	I was referring to the "Naka" part though.
SuperDragonite2172:	There's also that.
Lord Krelian:	Heck, I saw the name Naoto, and instantly thought of the Persona 4 character.
PKMN03 üò∏:	Ohshima made the actual character of Sonic the Hedgehog
SuperDragonite2172:	If I didn't have context, I would've thought you were talking about someone completely different.
PKMN03 üò∏:	^-^
PKMN03 üò∏:	Not the character
PKMN03 üò∏:	Naka made the game
PKMN03 üò∏:	The character design of sonic was not created by Naka
Lord Krelian:	As in, Sonic the Hedgehog? Was fairly sure Sonic was created by Yuji Naka
PKMN03 üò∏:	Pretty fluent in english
PKMN03 üò∏:	And he's actually
PKMN03 üò∏:	I've looked at his twitter and he actually seems to be extremely active on his twitter surprisingly
Animal_Man_:	nice
SuperDragonite2172:	Congrats.
Animal_Man_:	XD
SuperDragonite2172:	üëç
PKMN03 üò∏:	^-^
PKMN03 üò∏:	The creator of sonic noticed me
PKMN03 üò∏:	
Animal_Man_:	The walkthroughs, not lps
Animal_Man_:	He was the first youtuber I ever started watching reguarlly
SuperDragonite2172:	Same here.
Lord Krelian:	Eyan was the first LPer I ever watched.
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, Animal Man.
Animal_Man_:	g'day
SuperDragonite2172:	I didn't have a YouTube account for a long time either.
Lord Krelian:	I didn't have a Youtube account yet, though. Didn't have a Youtube account until about a year ago.
regal swan:	but i did
regal swan:	i dont remember how i found him
SuperDragonite2172:	I found him through his Platinum Walkthrough I think, then I went back and watched most of his other stuff up until that point.
Lord Krelian:	I've been a fan of Eyan since 2007. That's right, the beginning. I accidentally stumbled upon his NSMB walkthrough when I was looking up how to unlock the two secret worlds.
SuperDragonite2172:	Don't quite recall that one.
regal swan:	yea
SuperDragonite2172:	Chain Chomps?
regal swan:	or guard dogs
SuperDragonite2172:	They will never know about Ozzy and Ducks.
SuperDragonite2172:	It is.
Lord Krelian:	Thing is, I've actually seen even LESS people who have heard of Eyan. Sad, isn't it?
SuperDragonite2172:	You would think more people would know about him because of Eyan's HG/SS walkthough.
Lord Krelian:	He's one of my favorites as well, but I rarely see anyone who's ever even heard of him
SuperDragonite2172:	Are you kidding, he's one of my favorites!
Lord Krelian:	Wow, was not expecting to see a Chuggaa fan here
SuperDragonite2172:	And I've seen part of a playthrough of Xenogears.
SuperDragonite2172:	Although I've seen Chuggaa's LP twice through.
SuperDragonite2172:	Didn't get very far though, not even to the Bionis Leg.
SuperDragonite2172:	I borrowed a friends copy of Xenoblade Chronicles for a little while.
Lord Krelian:	Just out of curiosity, have you played any of the Xeno games?
SuperDragonite2172:	Mine was Pok√©mon Blue.
Lord Krelian:	Superstar Saga was the first RPG I ever played
SuperDragonite2172:	*shrug*
Lord Krelian:	There's the Superstar Saga remake coming out soon, wonder if he'll be doing that
SuperDragonite2172:	Althought the DS M&L games will be easier for him to capture.
Lord Krelian:	Yeah, the M&L games. And Paper Mario: TTYD.
SuperDragonite2172:	I vote for the M&L games.
Lord Krelian:	But anyway, yeah, I'd love to see Eyan do some of the Mario RPGs
Lord Krelian:	According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
SuperDragonite2172:	It's a clever trick in my opinion.
PKMN03 üò∏:	And yeah I did
PKMN03 üò∏:	Again. You can find them pretty much anywhere.
SuperDragonite2172:	By the way, did you get the one frog coin in the castle?
SuperDragonite2172:	But it's a Frog Coin!
PKMN03 üò∏:	Can I just say idgaf and move on? Just find another one on the ground. Coins are literally everywhere.
SuperDragonite2172:	I wouldn't know.
PKMN03 üò∏:	Also, you gotta wonder why they decided to bring the sonic anime voice actors into the games for a time...? ._.
SuperDragonite2172:	Interesting.
PKMN03 üò∏:	Well, that's the English name but yeah
SuperDragonite2172:	Kirby Right back at Ya?
PKMN03 üò∏:	Did you know that the Japanese Kirby anime had guns and alcohol?
SuperDragonite2172:	I've seen some of the English version of Youkai Watch, but not the Japanese version.
PKMN03 üò∏:	... and yes. They put women in bikinis wearing cat ears in a kids anime. Don't question it
PKMN03 üò∏:	It's from the Japanese Yokai Watch anime
PKMN03 üò∏:	Kudos to anyone who gets that reference
SuperDragonite2172:	>_>;
PKMN03 üò∏:	Second only to bikini wearing cat eared cosplayers
PKMN03 üò∏:	The second worst of all cosplayers
PKMN03 üò∏:	He's a peach cosplayer
SuperDragonite2172:	*shot*
SuperDragonite2172:	Mario is a cosplayer confirmed.
PKMN03 üò∏:	:p
SuperDragonite2172:	Pffft.
SuperDragonite2172:	Oh that.
PKMN03 üò∏:	;P
PKMN03 üò∏:	Cutscenes
SuperDragonite2172:	What part are you referring to?
SuperDragonite2172:	Eh?
PKMN03 üò∏:	Kappa
PKMN03 üò∏:	I like how apparently Mario has shape shifting powers in this game
PKMN03 üò∏:	Yeah
SuperDragonite2172:	Star Fox 2.
PKMN03 üò∏:	That'll be fun too
PKMN03 üò∏:	And the unreleased star Fox game
SuperDragonite2172:	I've played a bit of it myself, although I've gotten nowhere close to finishing it.
PKMN03 üò∏:	Will be cool to play it in the SNES Classic once it comes out
SuperDragonite2172:	It's a fun game.
PKMN03 üò∏:	I'm doing a semi blind playthrough of SMRPG right now and I'm really enjoying it
SuperDragonite2172:	And darn it Mee.
SuperDragonite2172:	Greetings, PKMN.

Dragonite:	no
FLUBS:	can we talk about cats again?
Dragonite:	i mean gummy abuses me on a daily basis but he's not very good at it
SquidofBaconator:	Gummy likes his abuse; he's a masochist
wolverale12:	He's a mod
wolverale12:	we will never abuse Drago
wolverale12:	no
FLUBS:	the way they light up just makes some primal feeling inside of me light up
SuperGummying:	Drago abuse is better
Dragonite:	right, gummy?
SquidofBaconator:	True
Dragonite:	it's less fun when he's not around
wolverale12:	<:coeNice:296012481069842432>
Dragonite:	but only do it when he's around
Dragonite:	gummy abuse is a go-go
SquidofBaconator:	I'm bad at conversations
SquidofBaconator:	So, how's that weather?
wolverale12:	Can we abuse gummy though Dragonite with words? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
FLUBS:	uhh...i like arson. burning trees is fun
wolverale12:	ok
Dragonite:	let's find some other idle conversation to be had
SquidofBaconator:	Ok then
FLUBS:	it was painless
Dragonite:	all right animal abuse is soooooooooort of illegal slash against chat rules
SquidofBaconator:	That never happened to Tom üòõ

FLUBS:	but...the wings...they burn off and the bug twitches for a few seconds after death
The Phantom Master:	tatsu is still down

The Phantom Master:	weird, the x/6 doesnt display for strike
