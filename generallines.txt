coffee drinker
it just might overhaul though.
that's the smell of nature, you fool
they charge money for use of the mods content.

owo this is interesting
great now i have self-confidence issues

the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
i don't want there to be too much lag
i needed that after dinner snack
everything?
you already do, ninny
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don‚Äôt feel powerful
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
good
so i don't have to do that ^^^
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
you are not joining
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>

he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
plus a server which is connected to the dm
my catchphrase is better
did i just walk in on something here
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
never most likely
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow

maybe flubs but i know how to handle most of the situation
no squid that‚Äôs inappropriate
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
what do you guys feel about randomizers
i could have done 1804 or 1815
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=

<:lul:305559915714576385>

that took years to make
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
yay!
make that dark chocolate and i'm in
well if he constantly says he‚Äôs 11 and to leave him alone because he‚Äôs young but acts like 11

what is wrong with me this week?
skarm knows all
how so?
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right

why are we talking about trees now

honestly, the only game that i‚Äôm looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i‚Äôm just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money

it just was pointless at the same time
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i don't think it was bad.
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
for not being faithful to the original

i‚Äôm back from work ya ninnies
and bad news
why would i be a home
that should be an option
drago
good news i get to meet her irl sooner than expected
see my stomach is not my weakness
i got a new mission
lets see how long this lasts before mee6 flips it back
and either way arguing is a sign of a healthy relationship, not an unhealthy one
soon enough that collection's gonna have an integer overflow or something
drago
flubs i don't like you
im shoving off bye
lower cost making + higher cost selling  = more profit
they deserve it though
lately i've noticed i dont really procrastinate assignments but i'll procrastinate everything else like my daily stretches for example
brb then
i don't think so
i'm calling the canadian equivalent of the fbi to put a giant magnet on your hard drive
zeke von genbu, chaotic bringer of chaos
but at the same time no
function factorial(x){
who said it didn't?
if wages scaled like they did in the 50s
yea prety much
   return (x>1)? x* factorial(x-1):1;
same until warframe
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
alduin plush
alright now that you have that out of the way go play warframe
those last two lines are contradictory
i could have install windows 2000
i can't watch this anymore
yea squiddy ya silly goose you
do you have a mic stand?
imma tackle drago at magfest
so i take it magfest is a pretty big convention in terms of crowd size
holy shit you did
shake me
or go
splatcord
planes were sturdy
oh god the intro
welp, i've corrected some incorrect intuition now so i'll retake the practice test in a bit to see how i do with the correct way to approach problems i first got incorrect
man i may love muskets
maybe it is
he doesnt play often though so i get it. im pretty sure he just walked into the encampment and lost
but when i teach you
25 minute work on highway
it‚Äôs not too old
thanks
instead of taking the bus
laptop?
no idea
no i meant something akin to this type of it
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
im gonna try weekly next
the relatively saine weekly version
god damn it he's been infected also
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
nice
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
its just an oversight but yknow
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing
its pretty much a video thing
too many password attempts
welcome <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
i didnt want you anyways
that's a line they can access
there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
you had to do that before?
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
feelsbad
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
oh cool
its best is an idiot
what's the link there for?
i mean like
i‚Äôm back from work ya ninnies
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
i read part of the book and i have to say
in 3
6 maybe?
i stopped going in december
i don't know
nah go ahead
algebra is fun
college is stupid
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
ah, gotcha
that's like the same thing right
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
thats where the secret money comes in
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
whats that the code for?
they won 1 and 3
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
but that really is me
that sucks
yeah
„ÉΩ( ÔΩ° „ÉÆÔæü)„Éé
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
and no drago
this is the original video
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp
i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
he does that in every episode
you said so
question answer
\:thinking\:
yay the light's on that means the battery didn't explode
ahhhhh
stream?
unless she's actually a competent person
i need a name
i already wave a white flag
lesson 1
so it is
don't forget no wind
i like when ted talk(s)
finally someone with some brain cells in this channel
my theme when i battle drago
<:rooisee:430400878302855177>
friends?
i'll beat you in civ and total war
whyyy
man i need better weapons
rhino skin should make that easy tho?
it honestly doesn‚Äôt last long sometimes
oh god i glitched the plains
isn't tomorrow labor day...?
it ended up hitting my leg hard
oh they're league teams
huh. now im just gone in general
game borders are fun
no you don't
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
you just can't youtube
its not raining, no
the plot's thickness isolates
i do!
sorry.
is it supposed to be raining?
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
i don‚Äôt remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
thank you
no she only has 514 points to your zero
lies
i know
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
no, i'm icelandic
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
slee[
i don't drink coffee
eh, it might sound like that
that is dr wossname
is she cute?
i never swear
yeah, let's go with that
what does it mean to not feel tired
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
help
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
in other cool news
teacher: who knows javascript?
oh wait todays the fifth
sick
ooooh nice
no college for me on thursdays üëÄ
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
how dare they
dont think it works that way
about?
physics is fun tho
huh.
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
press f for kugal
i love this university now
at least it works
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
and drago no
greetings, bella.
like 20 minutes over due
thats the answer im going with
fuck no
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
for x/x
okay
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
nice
sounds like a swell time
what
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
from what i've heard and observed
keep learning
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
watch me
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
huh. just finished reading eldest
let me go to sleep now
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
i'm over halfway through the day
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
mkay..maky..
oh okay
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
holy moly
delicate is playing
spazzer the great
and how strong they emphasis that course
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
so yeah
some courses last six months
im going to walmart today
hey magus i gotchu sum questions
the role
we have very eloquent discussions here as you can see
i use flutter bot
thanks i needed that
welcome home
i joined yesterday
but america has more boat
i think?
you tell them how fucking wrong that is
lmao
thats crazy
but first index runs all weekend for credits
ok maybe its a *little* bigoted
that's racist
imma become a professional poker player
or lie down
but the release date for the next update was moved to the 14th
seems like besides eyan
yeah that won't work
once done with these league games gotta farm reactant
what the fuck
i've taken 42 pages of notes in the first chapter of calculus, wow lol
hey subway is good
kill 42 with finishers without going down
only the splodiest memes for us
air is stupid
he‚Äôs our math boi
online courses yeesh
oof mauling citizens is fun though.
hello new person
not rn
also make sure you give blitzypoo ding dongs
friend
_dangles treat in front of spazzer's nose_
hmmmm
i can now
"258 in an 8bit system"?
no you cant
solve p=np
pat friend?
what happened
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
they have to
yeah no
there is a solution
or the existence sign?
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
why not use +
i always had a hunch
yea pretty much
that wacky character is a radicand
me too
yee?
i used to be smart you know
welcome to canada
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know
and you *pay* for it to be harder
so yep
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want
they make a lot of money
nope
like longer vacations
so more corporations get involved
you want mine?
now to roll it
back to volt i go
aw that was short
yeah
~~lizard9000~~
to sleep
~~the salt lick.~~
~~i knew ida was never really a human~~
awww cat
i'm your mother, of course i'm of age
what gave it away?
help flubs
what
anyone feel like grinding for lith in a few minutes
says you
good lord
i know that
glad to see you missed me
no clue
im getting close to having enough for all frames
do you still need any mesos?
thats a no go
one sec
being social is the worst
great now i have some racer's life insurance
in what context?
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
thats just when everything gets boring
youre asking me to change chairs, find the thing, come back, switch chairs again, and then talk hushed like so i dont wake sarah up
absolute zero breaks physics
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
seemsgood
yeah exactly
once the uncertainty principle fails
i'm hungry
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
somewhere
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy
i like breaking physics
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
everything changes mass
apple products are gross
so its a function and not a method, got it
somewhere
volta
are they also a pi√±ata?
they were trying to find a cure for something else
is that your final answer
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  a a aaa   a a aaa          a
you cannot pat me
it's a fairy explosion
dragon resists stupid
when moving
shoulder to shoulder generally
its healthbar went from 100-0 as soon as the cry for help went down
but its not midnight yet
also pretend to be the reverse flash if you feel like it
red is nicer tho tbh
yes that
me sleep now
i should just ask if i can get all of the papers for the homework/labs/midterm/final right now and turn them all in next week, and not show up for the rest of the semester
1) the programmer first sketched the desired classes, before writing the code seen above.```
how do the peoples of zeal do
he knew it too well
help
though it should be chill
i buy pok√© balls in lots of no less than fifty because the only thing i can be arsed to do is hit the `down` button on the shop screen and make it underflow to the maximum you can afford
yesterday
is dragonite still screaming on the floor
how are you typing then
i'm doing my homework
stop messing up the universe, it's unhealthy you idiot
okay who stole my bagel bites???
atlantic
i did not
the moon to where
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
is that a yes or a no?
and thats the start of skynet
hello there
someone lost the sign
imma look at my next calculus lesson
did someone say dog?
like wasting time
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
holy moly it's a short lesson too
it tastes like stale nothing
you're a plant?
also known as: colds suck
neato
i dont mind english
and im still horrible
if you get understood who gives a fuck
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
did it have victory road music?
work takes away my motivation to do anything
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
what
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
that's all im gonna say on that matter
so i'm worried
welp
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
no just the comic pages
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
im serious
drago i‚Äôll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
we'll see what happens faster: my beard reaches the floor or you finish sm
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question
that's fun too
my physics teacher roasted me today
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
volleyball
mind stone: yes
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
why is that surprising
if this was fight club
do people not do that
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful ü§ó
what game can we play together
how so
i wanna fight andi now
oh i guess i did
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
oh shit
boy oh boy
welp
im already used to spazzed making no sense but i dont get what rainy is talkin gabout either
why smelt a katana
is that a quantum mechanics joke
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
discord stop sucking
hold on im turning dead robot zombie hearts into jedi focus points to let myself have better mana regen
and he like discover gravity
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
but i like it flubs
like an eagle piloting a blimp
no cookie would ever combine chocolate with tomato
its nice
i can't understand
uninstall it or turn off the phone if you have to
where did they run off to this time
no idea ive never played it
i write notes on my laptop for film class
same
shit not again
citrus just got a lot more fun
what happened?
all the while java being noun.verb().verb().etc.
look at these nerds getting sleep
but why would you do that?
flubs
is a service doggo?
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
something like that
she would be mistress8998
but no one ever asked for my solution
thats the best name
also speaking of getting good at dark souls i hope i can do that soon
do you mean patches
he is the largest
everything
nerds
isnt harry potter just the bible but on even crazier drugs?
i don‚Äôt like them either
it's larger than a gallon
a different read but a good one nonetheless
they‚Äôre more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
oooh
i like this green fellow
fuck yeah
here too
its a 3 letter word, do you expect it to never come up in conversation?
my first thought was the millenium pyramid or whatever it‚Äôs called
friday has ida
allow me this as a late birthday present
it's been a long time
that too
does that count?
its free
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
oh shit yeah
turn my name back to green! pls
you should give him all your money
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
kugal why are you in an english class
i enjoy english
i imagine that's relatable
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
it broke like, 4 times?
exponential derivatives are that easy?
and?
but then i realize i probably was being mean
go play with your cat or something
and pet
that's a noni
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
plus i cant drive cos im a moron, lol
i wish i could say the same
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
well go get a cat
appreciate it buddy
wait
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
ouch
good
whomst aboot
also good job
hooray for books and food
a what did a what and played what and where was i
you just answered your own question
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
that's a good amount
you know i said in the literal sense
whats the advantage of online classes
oh cool whens that coming out
anyway, for warframe, i've heard rumors about that going on the switch, so i'm not too surprised with it going on the thing plus it's on every current gen console thus far
~~xenoblade x~~
i know mario maker hasn‚Äôt
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
i gotchu squid
they kinda have ongoing costs
plaaaaaaay something else
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
axi s3 and v7, specifically
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
decisions, decisions
just looked at it. it‚Äôs crazy how far and wide it hits the east coast
i like that
so i have an english essay tomorrow
i just spend my day off doing all of my homework
hmmm
definitely
you dedicate one day to homework?
priorities are s3 and v7
can you react with both to this message
nice
*slaps roof of cipher* apgt dpewp trebawqq bfdoq horcwhp
technology has gone too far
he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp
*smacks cipher* this bad boy can block so many people
add me if you want
hes helping me with my resume
am or pm
this is nothing.
so how did you decide i would get that one?
i live on the edge
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
new pokemon looks amazing
fair enough
nope
thats the time that matters
learning games
he wouldnt take the thing with him
today i learned that dippin dots has its own cereal.. :
im up for grinding now btw
who's good with computers here btw?
so much frigging effort
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
nope
me hungry
whatcha up to
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
like how there‚Äôs a venom movie without spider-man
i had no reference so i thought they were good
demon lord stop being old
my hearing is pretty bad
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
speaking of skyrim
emo spiderman.
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
"cane" -> [kayn]
hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
it's from that one berenstein bears book
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
why is that even a question
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i too like panada's
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
you should joint he party
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
good job windows
flubs let's be honest
exactly
master are you compensating for something
bye pnada
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
its not a toggle
no i mean like all the other people who are red you cant see it
i update it monthly
in other news dogs in cars are fun
you can only trade primes
be at worlds
i played as waluigi i think
i believe so
or an array of booleans
today ‚Äúdrop the whole fucking team‚Äù
bella and aminal
i mean
which is their week 1
got 3/5 becuase of the screwed up questions
nice
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
can you display that to three significant digits?
hey kugal
thats about what i expected
see pins
good job discord mobile
two hours until class starts and i dont have anying to do and my phone's on 30%
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
trynig to get boltor prime now
i was charging it and totally forgot about it
hey kugal
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
what skarm
can i have any leftover tacos?
mission so far successful
thats where we get tacos
what are the reqs?
i agree
i just don't know if the mod itself is good
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
i'm in the mission
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i prefer that
this does not bode well
trippy smooth version
darn
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
be nice flubs
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
nice
a massacre
anyways brb playing aatrox
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
well who knows maybe i deserve it
oh cool so the new 2000 series cards are a waste of time
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can‚Äôt buy and have no use for
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
ah, gotcha
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
rona is better
they also have metal
sure
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
chuck*
previews are nice sometimes
![]==[]
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
write about a space ninja
he comes every two weeks
and drago can be a guest on the show
e!wolfram 13 gmt
i had someone in my server thinking the nazis were good...how does this happen in a non public server
how was i supposed to know drago
let people major how they wanna major
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
it's like forcing a biologist to write a paper on physics
it missed obviously.
tmw your code doesnt work all afternoon and you finally figure out why
firefox > chrome anyways
i'm in the middle of figuring out how to use the wikipedia api to generate content for my homework assignment for me
i got 1 fact wrong on my astronomy lab and that dropped the grade by 10%
for three hours
nothing
and they sell for more typically
ham is gross
i can't believe i got all of ember's stuff in the minimal possible runs
lemonade
oh yeah that one was hard
it's true, grades k - 8th i literally didnt know anything
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
when i met him i was more successful
oh hell no
who had the changed
i‚Äôm not into the camera work at aaaaallll
yea if you're getting a phd you're basically saying you want to stay in school until you're like 30 +
my mom went back to school at 36
remember stay single and don‚Äôt do hard drugs
go for it
i remember back in 2nd grade i really liked ham and cheese sandwiches
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
im not single
often 8 +
drago
there is tension
ha ha
hah. time zones.
gotta do 5 waves with objective taking no damage on lvl 30+
kavat cudes up rn if you need them
damn sleep
or maybe just that boy with the hat
how is that going?

you haven't missed anything, lol.  i've been biding my time, adjusting to my new job and i'm ready to kick back into the streaming world
but i believe they are another type of number, in 4 dimensions
what are the orange dots
love the new icon üíó
i want to do some housecleaning on this server too, but that's another day's project

he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
kugal right click on the guy
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
it's called blue steak
kugal tell him that this is your alt account and point him to me as your main one
im gonna get too depressed
i feel like with all the diversity there is on the internet, ,there's bound to be one person who says that seriously
thats fair
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
i need a full size version  of it to comprehend
thats not dickish at all
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
thats dumb
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time
3 day weekend for me
not the one i expected you to pin
we did it

drinking water is fun
sun and moon
he would get to battle the fat kid
because you can never know for sure if they *arent* poisonous, but if you learn that they are you know
i've read a few *comics* about that
the fuck is a district
r i s e
its a piece of a state that has a senator
use your magic to cancel my classes too
when i was a kid my next door neighbor had a different zip code and phone area code
sup pals

happy womb escape day
how much man card debt is he in rn?
lets blame it on eyan
nice
it was way different from my high school
thermodynamics in gases?
wonder if they could rally together in name of my sad sad grade
if i‚Äôm teaching myself why do i even go here
i want to understand things i don't understand, but then i would understand why people are dumb. but then again that's self explanatory. screw that
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
open it
thankfully not
~~yeah, just ignore that last message of mine~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
thinkinator always helps
four little slices of salami rolled up with enough horseradish inside to make me not hungry
just join him and he'll eventually stop
is it hard to use a keyboard with panda hands though
this doesnt help it hinders at best
sorta
not bad
is that a politics joke
according to healthline.com, cooling the blood vessels can reduce the amount of blood that leaks into the surrounding tissue, which can prevent the bruise from being as apparent and reduce swelling.
then how would anyone know
i learnt yesterday ida edits better than me
the law of conservation of momentum is what keeps dragonite's butt in a chair all day
that includes pens, pencils, pencil lead, a notebook, some note flags, and i got 2 things that werent school related
yeah and also
im making a sick 3d model

today i learn you don‚Äôt get 6 tattoos of the person you love and that you shouldn‚Äôt propose after one month of datig
im surprise ida knows who that is
could you wait like 20 years to move in with each other first then
and they have a low level of entry but high skill ceiling
its in the name though
do you want to be married?
and i was on a podcast with a guy who has 60k subs. not sure how many people watched it; he doesn‚Äôt get many people watching his videos anymore
maybe i should lol
vortex is dead
like there's so many other things you can use that money for
but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
but dual wielded
nobody at work knows tho
and theyre hazy as fuck even with my glasses on
<:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
which im immune to
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt
today was interesting
yep, that's how uni is
i didnt diss it
wait i heard keyboard
tbh i haven‚Äôt seen any college kid smoke
oh god, there‚Äôs a chance for snow a little north from here üòë
i have never seen this game in my life so i don‚Äôt want to ask what it is
its not
comic book plotline?
ninja or samurai?
though impressive
i saw the previews and i am very ready for it
im just...?
very slight but very much liked
the fuck is a syllabus?
oh well fnatic is from eu
like super super hard
i want you to be super hard on me
you know is it bad that im still not done my essay due last monday

when does supper happen then
guys i think i hate xml.
i think so
and flubs you would not like this person
whatever you are but in irl
schools overcharge, hooray
i can get a slice of pizza at school for 2.65 but it doesnt taste very good
she dies
there‚Äôs only a couple shows where that‚Äôs ok
why would that be exciting for me lol
i don‚Äôt want to say specifically for spoilers but oh my god
dang
you should go look at it youll be even more disappointed in me than before
well yeah. its cod. thats to be expected. shitty, but expected
it‚Äôs not good to have lol
so far your friend‚Äôs not bad
fight my enemies yes
(this is totally not based off of a stackoverflow question i saw a little while ago)
its a special arrangement of only the finest ~~volatile death orbs~~ vitamin rich frenchless unfrieds
considering i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve had this chain before i‚Äôd be ok with that
i'm right on the edge basically
and if i flirt with her punch me hard
i‚Äôm an east coast boi because i live here and don‚Äôt travel
that's because california is weird
burgers for dinner is good
how sweet
time stops love
hmm i dont feel like working on game but i dont feel like nto working on game help
flubs hates everything
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
but the littlest part of me is expecting like 13/20 or something
time to buy prime junk
flubs ruin my day pls
or did you feel like batman?
i need like 3-4 of those
your dog is dead
we're only  touching a tiny bit on integration but im like amazing at integration, so that's little worry to me
since we're still in q1 here
im honestly thinking about it
no cussing young man
alright i got the two most important ones
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
i do not insist
damn
i don‚Äôt want it to work like that
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
my love life
usually, though
i feel like im cheating
aight
i might be able to, but not quite right now
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i can kinda see that
market
welcome
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
well from my perspective, a full time job may help since it's more consistent in terms of hours.  though i'm not certain.
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
i couldn‚Äôt stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
sorry
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
and you don‚Äôt have it on your switch or pager or rock
so basically if i do end up with this new girl she is cool that we breakup
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
i fell asleep at 6 last night
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
what does that mean
most bittersweet shit ever lmao
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
next question
play skyrim
i have become crazy
20 or 40?
maybe a shiba
im in
k back
welp there goes 10k focus
rip zeal wheel: he had a short life
took care of dragon
asking for a friend
i can‚Äôt give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>
fucking ask her
:üá∫ ‚ûï üá≤ üá™ ‚û° üçÜ
i forget the name of the splash one
can't take away a whole pc <:kappa:374346980136058893>
at most
wanna play my games but ehhhh
also i thought the same thing but guess what? you dont need to be good with computers to throw it out of a third story window
but my mom is bad w computers so i'm gokd
"can i pronounce its name?"
i realize something
agrewd
haha time to make fun of a movie
i found 36 ds and 45 gameboy advanced/color games in a box of my old stuff
can't find the account though
so more i go to get
he's a legend
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo
and
are the dodgers in the playoffs or something
im not currently but now i want to know the answer
your grandma's a command prompt
it‚Äôs the stupid booming ones too
i hope it's still on da somewhere
thats probably because i reconnected him
they hacking
no u
licorice
okay so uh
now, i speedrun games ye?
g2 took out rng so they're not a lightweight either
not bandwagoning
oh yea definitely no clear winner
wtf fnatic
when did it become 10
anyone can win
~~now you gotta promise to buy c9 skins if they win worlds~~
that tells me nothing
~~aqua is now magma.~~
of course they aren't bad
whos aqua
the other had a very close series that could have gone either way.
long term it may be a better move
5/6 finish in summer
i fucking love licorice
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
could make sense though
you don't know that
no reason for him to
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
don't look away kugal that number will be orders more the second you check back in on it
you should probably copy and paste all those as a new e!suggest after getting that important one
its your brother
i‚Äôm back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming
the only thing i dont really like much about the class is how some questions we are tested on but arent explained how to do them properly
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
i probably didnt score as high as i usually do, but probably not as low as how my toxic mind thought i would
like if i dont show my work in the best way he usually wont care, as long as i came to the right conclusion and he knows its my honest work i get full credit
i havent played skyrim in like ever
gonna do one more run for the night
i just kinda wish my midterm would get graded already so i can see the horrible score i know i got
i have such a bad problem with self confidence
so that fucking joey with 100 metapods doesnt beat you by running you dry on pp
still no octavia
i need to dump some cause im at 14/15 rn
i use carrier
dragonite's just a dork
my profs don‚Äôt even let you see questions you missed if you didn‚Äôt get to class early enough
you too
wait a minute what is that
or you stop to scan?
i mean yeah if i choose arceus or dialga or something i'd just look like an egomaniac
in practice the above is false
and it's been 5 minutes
and i wouldn't have met you guys
i figured it out
these are closely guarded doctoring secrets
normally yes but when it's you they're smiling at one should probably start worrying for their sanity
and smelled like perfume
that sounds like a euphemism for something to do with the toilet doesn't it
top ten things said before disaster
but on the front page
i got a fiora bug fixed by getting on the front page of r/lol once
i think you‚Äôre becoming 
**normal**
now to do it with all the consonants. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i have a meeting with a prospective school but there was nothing that was said i had to prepare... so i have no idea what i need
i forgot about that
plus it ain't exactly hard to fake degrees <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
delusional
just showing off my sprite rendered titanotylopus for zoo tycoon 1
üéâ good job aminal
personally i think im pretty great
good for you fam
squid is playing skyrim
she broke up with me
where is my sister
i am?
oh my
no it doesnt
the smoke detector just went off and dragonite's dog.exe has stopped working
theyre still not part of the game's files though
you dont hear anyone going "dear ideal masters ill trade you this dark soul gem for a spicy alchemy buff"
so did the dwarves get yote or just kinda fuck off and stop existing?
hey man dont judge the dwarves on their cooking techniques
incantations are probabaly part of summoning
but should i really?
is dragonite awake _before 10:30 for once?_
that's an uncharacteristically good idea
play skyrim for the 1,000th time
i know right
this is non-negotiable
play it safe and ask in the morning. people interrupting your mindflow is punishable by death
in other news the wikipedia page of "list of numbers" is pretty good too
think it would be safer if i asked an hour later?
it yelled at me about for loops and turning x degrees already too
not a procrastinator
youtube shut up im not voting for any of them stop telling me who to vote for
thats got whats his name
theres only one i actually want to see
havent seen it
the office is great
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
i miss the office. probably going to rewatch it
my hair is too messy
pm me
for the past 3 hours
yeah i ate a baby
dare i ask why you are on your phone?
but it also doesnt
i just looked the lyrics up
mannnn i am so effing pissed with this banner leak guy and the smash community right now
i'm pissed btw since sakurai won't get the satisfaction of revealing these characters now because of this leaker showing off all of the remaining characters
that is not a chaurus
but anyway my rant is over now
if it wasnt intended
but seriously batman and robin is better than the dark knight
making sure you're the right guy here btw, is that you flubs?
hey will
just move duh
other people don't want to be spoiled!
the wifi isn't out
wasn't even working on the wired computer
hello kugals
no it was my old flipphone
big enough where i don't fuck up and press another button
depends on the topic
i hate phone typing
i only used it for 2 things
i uninstalled skype
but who gives a fuck its easy to use
i sort of understand that, my hands were really shaking after playing on my ps3 for a while
i have to actually look at what i'm typing if i have to use a touchpad
i must know these laws
it isnt even about cold i just have a weird feeling in my hands and wish for it to not be so annoying. if i wear gloves i dont have to put as much pressure on my fingertips
yea he said he had tog o
the what now
i remember that
im great at saving money gum
<:roocomfy:399827521253670912>
good point
i can't spell
make peace
tell me what he said so i can say it too
but i figured out what the joke was gonna be
i didn't knock anything off my to-do list today and i just want to go play skyrim instead
some time in the mines should straighten you out
especially if you still interact witht he person after the fact
the forsworn are nice they have cookies and only try to kill you on some days
good job gum
because it's like
idk how females work
did someone steal his sweetroll?
i am depressed
hey sis wanna move in with me for a day?
oh - dah - ving
that‚Äôs how i was until 2016
no stick pls
that did not age well.
what was the snapchat of
understandable
last time it was scary
hop to
thats going in the sub
actually kinda
me me me!
flubs
night at 5 am
that was four and a half hours ago now
guess whose monitor broke the night she needs it
im in bed before my sis
my classes hardly have gotten cancelled this semester and i don‚Äôt approve
i don't know dating
blitzypoo is next in line
thats the best
set her on fire then she'll be hot
the females only have bad luck though because you keep trying to talk to them
pfft
kugal he said _smart_
yeah i'm surprised there's that many too
interesting
either or
panda's here who wants to talk about butts
i'm not either but it makes my inner seven-year-old giggle
see ya drago
amen to that one
i‚Äôm just lazy and did an all in one kind of character
night drago
set who up with me now
i can hook drago up with a girl
she is 19
how old is she
also did i say i was going to sleep? i lied i got distracted by reddit
i mean i did the age test
but jesus that reminds me im gonna be 17 in like a couple of months
you and her go out
everyone wins
im gonna invent it for the lonely and desperate though
of course it isnt
my parents want the opposite
why is he asking me about shit thats past due
does that help
plot twist i never slept
~~sleep is for the weak and squid~~
is the twitter-removing-the-like-button thing real or did i forget to wake up this morning
good job?
so anyway, i drove a half hour to class, only to find out that class was cancelled
why didnt dragonite see said email?
that‚Äôs not the reason you should have to dislike this happening...
guess who got an email saying that class was cancelled!
either my teacher's email account is magically broken and it's the only one because i"m still getting every single other piece of spam that the school sends out to every single student, or my teacher didn't send an email
what other girl gum
oops didn't see you there
i recorded stuff earlier. need to edit it sometime
i should probably record something
needs more letterboxing
my desk drawer is jammed shut and that's where i keep my wii remotes
#getidaoutside
maybe revise that sentence
so sad. i already miss its weird screeching and rubbing sounds
shit i needed ida since idk how to food shop
buy food to make into food dont buy instant shit
just buy food
well i eat like what the soldiers ate in the 18th/19th century
is what good for you
is it even that good for you
honestly
instant coffee
i don't see anything wrong with it
why did i quit...
both on pc and phone
and i loved it
i have notifications turned off
provolone is pretty good but mozzarella is better
becaues that'll take forever
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
i know that, deci
one of my programming teachers told me i failed the midterm because i answered all six qurstions instead of choosing five
silly dragonite its not the pastime its the career
flubs front and center
nick valentine has the same voice actor as belethor and a bunch of other minor skyrim characters
dont do that its bad
okay, so where you do want me to put this lighter fluid at?
honestly i think a lot of people would stay in the server if they were greeted by a bot calling them a fuckwad and saying he was gonna murder them
its so very fair and balanced that he gets a free soul charge
so basically the whole ordeal
it breathes a certain air of positivity i think the world could really use
his excuse was that he has bipolar disorder
im curious now
you should do a histiry essay on tbe history of history essays
i have uploaded all of my 2014-2015 super mario 3d land videos
i should probably install a virtual machine with ubuntu or something
but they have tacos and burritos
i should have said chipotle
probably
the best thing ever
i always want to try chick-fil-a
and walmart in the frozen food aisle
drago
like some people do
i also like cheese
the latter
which makes you eligible for a parking ticket
it's a dessert pastry made of phyllo bread, filled with a mixture of crushed nuts, and held together with a syrup.
so i'm in no way tempted.
blackwake is on sale
how does one get someone in trouble in online school?
i came in to class
were you helping students on tests
do it
real scary
then yes its good
despite someone gifting it to me
and then there's stuff like the halting problem and the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics
your body wants you to get coffee ice cream instead üòâ
i don‚Äôt, so i don‚Äôt know why i want one
also take everythign i say with a grain of salt, im just angry, i dont mean anything i say
just to give ya an idea
maybe
im doing it, i cant let today happen again
or that you can‚Äôt be accessed by them, so they‚Äôd know it anyway
delete it
the focus is all just from running eidolon hunts
good choice kugal
no flubs and not robot
cool thanks
good luck bella
where are my dating advisors?
good luck
im not too fond of halloween
maximum full melee flow mode

we live like the 18th century
perfect
enjoy
jeesh its almost 4, where did time go
why would i have it?
sooo if i date her
i dont think thats how it works bud
i went out of a bathroom
also probably why i don‚Äôt like them
cause thats the most common answer
and i don't want to spend money on drops after noticing that recovery time was faster when i didn't use them
dare i ask what his response was?
interesting
with spongebob
i can‚Äôt get my head around it
sounds fun. might be able to later
boy were they wrong!
but the c did not accept the peace treaty
pls use code word
caught up on last week's flash for the episode tonight
they had a strange start schedule but its evened out
i guess they didnt make any in the years i played nintendo games
i dont think i played anything on the gamecube
when is paper skyrim coming out
i was busy
when elder scrolls 6 is cancelled, dragonite
i would write a very angry letter to todd howard's mother
we're fucked
why has no one used pick up lines on me?
nobody has it also how the fuck do you get robbed by a me
amazon is 24/7
secrecy
places arent open
i think the elven dagger has the fastest swing rate
whaaa

<:doit:334014889137930240>
i found someone im smarter than

xenoblade it is
i have an opportunity to record xenoblade today, the question is, can i be bothered to turn my wii u on
i think i did
shouldve replied "because your mom told me"
predicted death date: 8 december 2057
wait you have your normal icon how did you do that?
lmao even wolfy doesn't like "to-mah-to"
better than canadian weather
so thats $60 an hour for private security and $2600 for the flight and hotel
you guys ever get the feeling that the best way to find points for your argument is the flaws of the antithesis?
i will pay for her food though
i have to do a paper... but its also halloween.
unless dragonite feels like staying up till 2 as usual
its already christmas season
he probably swapped back after that screencap was taken.
hmmm
thats why
ftp is for like lettuce and cabbage and stuff though there really should be a separate protocol for the important stuff
do tomorrow's physics tonight?
tcp stands for "the candy protocol" right
academic or professional?

<:doit:334014889137930240>
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
halloween is dumb people dont even look like scary
oh they definitely are
or take matters into your own hands
i think halloween is moreso a fashion show now
im a kaiser
hey man i profit regardless
perfect <:lul:305559915714576385>
you record your office?
that's not what i was going for
awww whyd i do that
i hate halloween
like so many times i wish micheal would bully her hard
ryan is one of my favs
and its not fun
but i love ryan
depending on context, especially the dwight one
the office
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
because spoopy memes
not on netflix
pffft haha
im gonna do that next time
i feel deja vu coming along
since beef
that doesn't mean you can do my drugs
the office
there is a 25% chance she will say no
works for me a little too well
also that ^
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
jeez that box office is a lot
but you're still a tad young for that lol
he is lonely
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
weird, i can do that soon
panda, let's go get coffee
i think usually do almond milk
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
the odds are low
well, mostly fittings and horseshoes
or like straight as an arrow
post malone? <:roothink:399827523581771796>
mini√© rifle
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
i am a hair person
besides you can't hurt me rainy
i got acne on my forehead as well
and that i should stick to history
.....
my own sister against gum
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
blake isn't fuckin jacked
those are the best girls
me neither (sorta)
because eventually you cross a line and you go back to us and ask what you did wrong.
my grave!
i think i‚Äôve only seen an episode of scrubs
sleep over?
alright, everyone come over to my place, and we shall watch it and have the time of our lives
on purpose
well ida knows me well how i always somehow i accidentally do it
i told her she is the best
raven, sorta kinda
i prefer a slumber party
i just said she has more than you.
it‚Äôs like what me and drago so
bam roasted
i wouldn‚Äôt know what to order. i should try that out
oh look it's three in the morning how'd that happen bye
if you like white chocolate go with that
it‚Äôs fake
so what's the other option bella?
good enough for me, thanks guys
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
of what the literal differences were
smash just gets way too much hype and attention
is this true?
real men play mario kart
mario kart 9 is happening?
next week boys next week....
well gives me a few days to work out what i wanna say to her
okay well i blame flubs
in the northern hemisphere
flubs.
probably when the tenth gen consoles come out
because i left cookies and milk for santa once
wonderful, thank you
a character from xenoblade if i'm not mistaken
that certain emperor is me
how do you know that
and i can‚Äôt say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
yeah, i guess that‚Äôs a point
oh flubs she got sick tomorrow
but yeah, rex got relegated to being a fucking costume
him too
there you go
in fact i appreciate it
worth it if it works
flubs
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
no problem
but fell in college love
its only two late when one or both people are dead
alright but fear of rejection flubs
that was because i didnt have enough material though
i got a lot of things happen to me during my love life
so i would say they were sweet?
i wouldn‚Äôt care unless they were still dating someone
what else?
just have no self esteem
since they were still my friend
ok but you understand that her being in a previous relationship changes nothing right
not an a hole
which is a lot of people
depends who i don‚Äôt like
there arent really more though
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
in my life time
you mean my little one or ida?
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
so i don't know what i would do if i wanted to settle down
and upset
yet you were in the hospital waiting for her
the book says go somewhere fun
ahaha no
i need someone to help me grocery shop
i'll buy wine
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
god i hate november
why is the library a choice?
if youre asking them out invite them over
no offence ida i know you would
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
so i would have to pick
farmers market it is
anytime xd
probably helps not to limit it to one place
or what bella said
there is this good ice cream place...
not mine
that is benny's date
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
is there a stream right now?
told her over snapchat because she pressure me to say it because i told her i had something to tell her
true
i got rejected
yes you can
tuesday no matter what
but can i ask when will king of zeal/superskarmory will be back recording for youtube again?
i doubt even _he_ knows honestly
i am a disappointment to myself
that kid who i blocked, his brother confronted me about it in the middle of class
yay?
fighting him is better
skyrim
my teacher say the conversation and sent probably one of the sweetest emails i've ever received
<:lul:305559915714576385>
well i wish i saw that edit sooner
"we got to have.... *moneyyyyyy*"
>that sad moment when you realize you have a stronger connection with piranha plant with the games you've played over the characters in the fake banner/grinch leak since you haven't played those characters games
the german empire anthem is amazing
i'm not sure on how many stages we got with smash 4's dlc btw
bummer we didn't get smash run though, but oh well
hopefully there's not going to be another stupid great maze again
like why do you care, lol
the "not-so-great" maze.
and then it turns into who cares about a boyfriend when you can get an a in calculus
yes its more chill than secunda, dragonite
like i said to that certain person i saw, he could always be dlc
how many square tomatoes is it if each tomato is 3
yeah i expected as much
i have my character predictions ready for the dlc
which is better than platforming imo
still gunning for elma and joker, though i have my doubts.
nah, just felt like saying it
i see you are making use of that right today
this isn't in any order btw
it probably wasn't important right
for the record i didn't invent you rang i got it from foxtrot who got it from the addams family
who probably got it from somewhere else
oh you know what it's private
i could have invaded canada with all of my stupid high school videos
you said yeet like 6 years before it became common
i guess if you have steam 2fa enabled you should grab your phone too but only if you own skyrim
how did i miss that
and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold lies and the gold he had made
so greenland is on white witch time
i actually dont really like the smb3 overworld
the 90s were a mistake
also i played x in italian once even though i can only read like ten words of italian and was fine so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i loved playing as them
other n64 games aged decently, sm64 was not one of them
destiny 2 is supposedly free until nov 18 but i cant find where tf the free version is downloadable
anyways, i have nothing to do until stephen‚Äôs extra life stream starts in around 3 hours
and i tend to call myself a cat so that makes me a furry
-----.----

yeah
and it actually takes months unless you pay money
it's painful
im at 0%
you know what better than that
see if the achievements were no hit a boss or complete the game at sl1 thatd be fun
it was trash in gen 3
poor paris
like i just dont enjoy the action of eating
im also wondering this
run from it
runs at the speed of fucking sound into a brick wall and smashes her head into the ground
peggy still arives
always been trying to catch that one in animal crossing
as much as i would love to see everything go down, i have work tomorrow afternoon
i hate eating recently
are they nice?
dread it
be a shut in neet who hasnt seen the sun in two years
aint nobody cooler than this dan
amazing island is *already* back in fifth
sup pham, i just got a switch, so if u got one and wanna add me, here‚Äôs my friend code.

yeet
i wake up at 6 for work. makes me feel like i have a productive day
i woke up at 9 today and really wasn‚Äôt into it
sleeping doesnt make me less tired
maybe ida
1 am
you get used to it.
i do indeed
he lives!
use the one that doesnt sear your eyes
hot and lonely months
interesting
i still dont know *what* magfest is
it hurts
lets all go to magfest
it's also a secret excuse to eat hamburgers all weekend because all of the other food in the area is either expensive or trash but dont tell my mom i said that
perfect drago
he has hair like you
its directly across the sound from me and they have cheap crab and cheap alcohol
drink alone in sadness and cryu
i give you my presence
playing around with my joke youtube channel
it's like 1974
wing together a perfectly calculated setup
i think you're a bit too concerned about the layout but if it makes you happy and gives ya something to do, go for it
i spent 1 hours before i fell asleep watching musket videos
wait stream is on now?
freedom it is
only convention i know what i want to go to
when going to nyc we do usually stop at albany overnight to visit friends tho
out with family
what else would be on the do something useful category?
lol xd
demand your money back
you should probably do that too
guess i'm going to hell (the piece is called the gates of hell btw) lol xd
these are quite obviously shrute bucks
drive into pillars, is a good insult
"let me make my *entire fucking life* public
but i like free experience and money
you're allowed to run around it if you can't kill it somehow
one on the broken ds one on the not broken ds
see, peggy.
also writing is hard \
well i need a script writer
but what if youre a poketuber
that concerns me slightly less than mr. joe on street street knowing everything about my daily life
flubs, you need to react to more than just the c
dont google that
understandable
c is the only letter that's actually a base though
was a very interesting car ride.
shes laying on my leggs
my mom's boyfriend put on a ben shapiro debate today
they're waffling about somewhere, i'm sure.
ice on the sidewalk
i dont have his phone number
brb class
how dare she say that
well i need a lawyer and my sis is the only one that knows how to do this law thing from those ace games she played
you tripped over a mouse?
it made a really loud nosie
i have it
do you want a wall of 3's, flubs?
well yes. but sometimes we don't like fractions and prefer decimals
but with the question of dec100/dec3
hex superior
the chicken looks like i ran it over with a cement mixer
it's a dital image compressed using a discrete cosine transform
tried sending a picture with a message, but it didn‚Äôt go through
i kinda wanna hear the story behind that
tomorrow i meet up with the girl who rejected me
well done!
or just not do them
there
twitch is broken for me
hmmm
also its not loadi g for me
hahaha
what does that page say?
"don't fucking try me"
and i believe i still have the exact same score as a year ago. this is what happens when you never get a relationship
i regret going down this road
~~you~~
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
but the islands disappearing bit
not the "no one noticing for 30+ years" but
also i used a random follower for the boethiah quest and now i feel terrible
oh wow
they're your friends
second on the list is annoy drago
the disadvantage of a morning class: i really want to get the thing we need to do today done already
like sit there and do nothing
also the more i talk to my uni friend
well flubs
oh i know that one guy from pirates of the caribbean
comadore
im lonely
thats on them
i don't do that unless asked
thank you person who said that
lmao
according to vikings they don't say that
a hug is the most anyone gets from me
i only hug people i like
history?
you'll learn to enjoy it
only if you take them according to prescription
i sold my civic duty for drugs
so it's even
i know
someone should collab with me
<:lul:305559915714576385>
okay, because 100%ing mm is not as bad people say it is, and you're also on the remake and not the original
and then give it all to me because it was my idea
i dont see it
because video game movies are famous for being well-made and successful
congrats
how on earth are they like me then
not do oot: master quest blind, probably
wait how can the big man move
ahh bob ross
oof i wanna lean to bros 3
i gotta wait 20 minutes for the bus
anyone here?
im so cold right now
it's mind numbing
well
fiddlesticks
....
first thing in mind that i think when math is said is calculus
is there any actual use for a function whose order is 29
is that my cue to spend the next four hours writing code for things other than classwork or
i forget what the other name for the biggest exponent is
but that method is gold
antiderivatives are pretty neat
what‚Äôs wrong with breakfast
okay the last time i ate breakfast voyager 2 had officially left the solar system, but only just barely
things it does right: 1
things it doesnt do right: 68,7634,541
although node probably lets you do it
maybe 4th
the "getting up before 10:30" part
i mean javascript wasnt really designed for taking console input
yeet
i wonder if i can launch both the special edition and the regular edition
earth prolly
it is bad
im a kaiser
get it out of my head!!
flubs we should hang out sometime
welcome!
<:lul:305559915714576385>
hi person
after that it's less fun
ironic that it's with breana
i have a heart with someone on snapchat
also i taught my dad how to use discord
im actually not fully in charge of editing thank god
and somehow he likes me
most shit post admin would be...yeah prob master
ida don't encourage him
you don't remember when we first met
i don't..
i do
im still grossed out by that movie
do you play nerdy board games?
changed*
no you're not
yep!
to be honest
sorry ida but i can't take orders well or do something i don't wanna do
i would have destroyed everything
i like war but usually when i am here i think about it more
someone lemme know if thats too harsh, i'm legit not sure
this server is not nearly as mentally taxing as some others i'm on
which leads me to think about war the most when i am here...
great now i just know my mind is as bad as eyans thanks
and i thought ida was actually gonna end up like one of them because when eyan's server started she just went super mean to me
no drago
i feel like i missed a lot in the few months i was gone
im too rough now
and one of them threatens to punch me
ida i need protection
you were here yesterday though
can confirm because school is stupid
who has heard of the war of 1812?
werent there two of them
what
even the rejection ones
we are gonna do that
thank god since i hate kisd
just remember you got your whole life ahead of you
you weren't as annoying
let em come to you
can't have friends knowing
has nintendo given up on qa or something
theres some things i want to catch in the pok√©walker but it requires me to get a lot of exercise and i dont feel like walking the dog or going a bunch of circles in the kitchen
for once i thought about it
i'm leafleaf
nest
we've talked about this before
i don't remember but it might be
<a:atpc_jumpcited:485160985028460546>
this let's play stuff i will only work on
change your nickname then
thank you.
hey ida when are we gonna hang out again?
i gotta get through that
so nekopara is on switch now
hey, wanna watch lion king 2?
i have castle crashers
hey heard about that new undertale prequel game?
okay
sorry
and flubs
not the first game
didn't know who it was so i rejected the request
wowee
but back then it was absolute horseshit and no one wanted to pay $60 + a monthly subscription for a shittier version of wow
the world thing on steam
and probalby even more that ive never heard of
usually just end up getting 50 in one handed and giving up and go full warrior
two handed or some sorta conjurer is what im leaning toward rn
ended up fisting alduin to death since i was a khajiit
hmmmmm
because i'm terrified
jeez how many ffs are there now
still the same thing in oblivion
but you could conjure armor along with that
i‚Äôm very curious to know why some guy has a cut out of what i think is ash‚Äôs hat strapped onto his forehead
i have 108 as my iq
i dont like playing as an archer
lab mates and i today picked up beans with different items in the name of science.
why were there germans in hong kong
also did anyone hear about defy media shutting down?
i haven't had cereal in years though
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i guess i could just pet my dog until i have to go
don't
95% chance
hi person
~~screw family~~
you rang
i'm not responsible for hurricanes, power outages, comcast, and acts of god
should i play skyrim
guys.
i have downloaded a dating app
that is fair
this is too hard
active?
like what i enjoy and stuff
i can see how outdoor pictures would be more appealing to people
would have love to see how that would turn out
mapquest is not a dating app
but i have a rarity beach pic when i pretend to be rarity
thanks i've been up for 3 days
two in the morning is nothing
you know this sibling role play thing is so fun
flubs i'm looking for work as a professional dog petter, are you hiring?
shes been dead for like a billion years so yeah the new old people who live there would probably be confused
sorry fam im employed fulltime doing redacted right now
i could pet your dog for you while you're away doing redacted
‚Äúi‚Äôm not tomboyish, i‚Äôm just boyish‚Äù - flubs 2018
hi dead i‚Äôm squid
there is a moth flying around my room and i hate it
high
hi didnt fucking say im, i'm dragonite
it's what i'm about to listen to
it got too quiet after flubs stormed out
he did
uh huh...
im about to do the craziest thing ever
we only broke up 6 times
doesn't matter
hi i'm fucking done, i'm--oh screw this
imma do it
wait depends
tortillas have been eaten sleep now
brought to you by ms paint (tm)
panda might know
did it involve beans
my way is better
this is one of the rare times i use the mlp way
my biggest issue is the amount of services they expect you to subscribe to in order to be able to have a wide selection of newly airing shows
greetings and salutations, dan! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!
10 minutes?
thats not much of a concern to me
my fave flavour is salt and pepper wings
flubs i did something stupid after you left
drugs?
i mean uh welcome
also i had a dream that i was sneak attacking draugr in skyrim
someone doesnt understand how fast explosions are
also believe in your king
<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
welcome
there we go
yes?
just be like me and make all your videos terrible <:kappa:374346980136058893>
how do i do the tm thing?
but i had a sibling bonding week
but it's _almost as if the author has never installed an mmo before!_
but you didn't let him get ahead
obviously he started streaming twenty minutes ago but didn't realize that his internet isn't plugged in
it is right now
except you need to actually do something in mario kart to win
you don't have to pay me i just want to pet dogs
or do you?
omg looking at the old msgs i was way more energetic back then
you can play the game with no button inputs, that's just how you go in 12th
holy shit i was not like what i was last year
not that tm
who even knows
someone tell daylights savings to stop so i don‚Äôt want to sleep at 5 k thanks
hey ida hows the arctic circle the week before christmas?
like before daylight savings id feel like i was gonna get axe murdered on my way to work but now i dont
dark at 5? weak
i wanted to do something similar in wearing a costume the day after halloween
you can't threaten me
dark
will do
tell her that dragonite is cheering for her
thanks flubs
because of what i suffer two years ago
so i am angry to this day over it
flubs wireless or wired?
unsurprising
or i will, soon
i have ice cream
agreed
i just beat him like 4 times in a row, and he wasnt able to play online before today, and i fucking destroyed him, and the combo i use stunlocks people if they leave an opening and also i kept taunting them
oh also i failed the mission
it was online
go ahead flubs

quiet keyboards are nice
stan lee is dead.....
his daughter confirmed he is dead
i really want to play rdr2
otto was cooler than lincoln
im sure he would appreciate that sentiment
see my champ pool is l o r g e
oh god, we‚Äôre probably going to get 3-5 inches of snow tomorrow
today i learn you can make ice
history lecture pls
i can make a math/history vid
im listening to music on it just fine
thats sucky rc
as long as most of them are in the same language your teacher will just read too much into it and give you an a
bam assignment done
2. enough flour
i'll get back to you in a few days
dont rush yourself kugal
prob was too rough on it
no my computer mouse is falling apart
listen, after i more or less dropped off on harvest december after how absurdly long the august arc was, i think i'm at least going to try to get caught up with something that is not 'dragonite tries to read on camera'
that sounds like peripheral abuse
what, did samsung make that mouse? /s
fancy that
will the livestream be live until 11‚Äôish?
is stream potato or is it on me
i think it may have been head icons, specifically the homestuck one
im not drunk im flubs
i‚Äôll take the silence as a yes
yes samsung made it
okay, ,the show more input i guess broke
that brings you to a grand total of 55,682 years in jail or cleaning the toilets in the zeal palace until the end of eternity
what‚Äôs eyan streaming? xcom again?
good to know it's still functional i gu‚Äînever mind
no he is not
correct dragonite
yeah youre definitely up late
i managed to bs my way through most of it in 90 mins
that sounds like vampirism but worse
vampirism is great though
but yet you want me?
are you surprised
i am suspicious
the amount of dog pets that must happen per second is greater than the amount of seconds that happen per second
so someone tell me why my computer mouse is half beaten to death?
never give them back to me ever again
sooo yeah
yeah
dont say that to her please
im trying my best to assist
wait
like?
i need that medicine
and yet im kinda down for the similar reason but for me it‚Äôs more of
always wanted to experience a life of a soldier in the 18th century
that sounds like his problem
go to razer
i won‚Äôt ida
top ten smartest human beings who broke the system
we get snow
people are always angry there
i had fun there
you hate a lot of places
not including western fire island because western fire island is the tits
weird right
but you seem to enjoy life
now i don‚Äôt
though flubs happens to not get under my skin at all...
tbh most of the reason i dont stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing is because id be justified to and people wouldnt really be surprised
platinum
i like dogs
cats aren‚Äôt that bad as i originally thought
im german!!!
like i only dont at this point because i didnt before
here:
im going to the hair salon
actually looks great...
get a mohawk
i know, but that just gives me a few basic ideas
oh no
we've proved that ‚àö2 is irrational, we've proved that the number goes on forever, isnt that cool?
ida wanna cut my hair?
you'd think that would be impossible
and thats what makes it so not absurd
hey flubs did you know there's the quadratic equation...and the cubic equation? for cubic functions, functions like x¬≥ and not x¬≤
thats the cubic equation
well, math isn't simple because life isnt simple
i like science and math though! d:
idk maybe the higher level shit is cool but i never did any of that
which is why youre frigging weird
thats why nobody likes science either
ok mr 100%
if anythign it sucks really bad for the lazy kids who arent motivated and dont want to learn what they want you to learn
i needed it for my math classes here.
if they dont get high state test scores then some bad shit happens to the shcool or whatever
so i think thats one thing schools emphasized for soem reason
knowing how to do basic multiplication and the primary colors doesn't exactly make you look smart
and regardless of your actual intelligence
i was one of those until i wasnt
you're just gonna buy new ones aren't you
9th grade i took algebra, 10th grade i took geometry and algebra 2
but now it's like the complete opposite
im currently in intro to stat and calc 1
cats are kinda like me
algebra 2 had *some* trig for me
done with my phone call
dinosaurs are fucking awesome
not for me though üò¶
here ill teach you about dinos instead
then fuck em
theyre fuckin awesome
bully them back
make them feel useless
do it!
bully them back
why is it not alive
guys i spent the evening out of my coffin playing ping pong with dad and it somehow wasn't awful
wacky
draco go watch grass grow or something
i could win a world record for how stupidly redundant i can be
did someone say steak
butter on cookies?
excuse you all cookies are created equal
no theyre like so vanilla that they dont even contain vanilla
why do i have to suck at this game so badly
is having a good time with your father a bad thing?
why do elevator button pushers exist
i like it
yes they have animals with names like kangaroo and wallaby and blue-ringed octopus
also i have 2+ hours of the last two worlds of smb1 to edit
the answer is yes
no its bob ross
speaking of the upside-down
google was actually really disappointing
fuck
kugal stop being good at things how dare you
this is torture
its comparing two stories and how rhetorical devices were used to advanced and add power to the persuasiveness to each piece of writing
i wrote a poem about hating poetry once
im getting flash backs to poems some girls in my highschool wrote
i remember one day in like 9th grade? i sat on the couch and just got caught up on my english work. i got caught up, but not before doing 5+ hours of poetry quizzes and tests and readings and ***uggggggh***
ew facebook
probably
this "3d rendering system" thing is haaaaaaaaaard
not anymore
"shut up my sentret needs the exercise"
right skarm?
i also considered microwave oven and motorized can opener
my calc 1 midterm was stressful enough lol
and then it ends and you are even sadder because it‚Äôs over
i fixed my mouse btw
i broke it with a hammer and fixed it with a hammer
poetry for fun is really pleasant
human with a side of aged honey mustard
is 70 kg a lot and is 20 m/s a lot
155 pounds is a lot tho
maybe i should just take it up to the roof of the english building and drop it
not with that attitude
imma become an artist
bugger off mee
> is already signed into google drive
nahhh
i held!
oh, eyan‚Äôs streaming
t=+15 minutes and teacher is swearing at git, as usual
hey ida civ 6 next?
but i held on
if i have it i guess
i really should probably go home but the other people are being so weird it's hard to resist wasting time to see what airhead things they do next
watts aren't a lot
climate change sure is good aint it
at this rate i'm conviced fall just completely disappeared. so now there are only two seasons
and not july
i don‚Äôt want sala
what is a noitarepo
can‚Äôt i just create a goddamn palindrome
but then you would need shirts with three sleeves
well flubs they usually flow downhill
but you would definitely pet it 50% more
well
i can't tell if you're just being a contrarian
if you know something is a dumb idea
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
both
everyone gives me a less than 1% chance
well my sis is not with me
hint you cant
rit is not a state university
not a courtroom
reasonable amounts of sleep is for the weak
nah cuz if i did that i couldnt get on to the night terrors as quickly
why was it forced on?
first off, mood
and i just made up some 9 year olds new gamertag
flubs thats asymmetric i ahte it
second semester was more of the same plus a political science elective
pretty sure that's tje gamertag of a kid on my bus
i like using 489 in names because its very witty and im quite smart
this one
dont enter rem
dude being sad about the future is next level
as i say
this is the biggest time i chased after a girl this deep
i'm in a permanent cycle of mad and sad
or at least your postal code
i'm falling asleep from boredom at the same time
dragonite, you do cool things, stop
"opportunity"
yay for english
is it pronounced eye-er or err? who the fuck knows
is hampshire not pronounced with the shur part
that‚Äôs the only way i‚Äôve ever said it
black cats always win
i want to pet my dog
i can love both
but she's sleeping in dad's room and i dont want to wake up dad just to pet my dog
unnecessary
demon lord you should upgrade to a dog
nah jk i love my cats too much
why on earth would you want your code to execute _slower_
i remember begging my mom until we got one xd
he's of contrary opinions
you know what pronunciation makes no sense what so ever
on the other, what kinda shitty ass parent would disapprove of a class that helps their kid be healthier and more active
no im lazy
but nowadays cats are easier for me to take care of
i tend not to like the kids who play it
1% chance to get her back
it just still feels way too early for this area's snow season. and it's not supposed to be winter yet
fuck i should be sleeping
dab drago
i love when it‚Äôs snow season just to see the majority of you guys flip out
but _that_ is the reason people should care not "oh no popular thing"
its land though
bella i'm kidnapping you and forcing you to live in the temperate part of the country so you can suffer with the rest of us.
i think thats it station wise
and its got mountains
anyways i am gonna make an anthem
if it's about me
again
this, a song of sons and daughters
college girl and i talk a bit more lately on snapchat
when you grew up in phoenix
sup pals
hmmm
shall we watch again?
the bear thing killed me
once you know what verbs and prepositions are english is pretty ehhhhhhh
you‚Äôre fat
hey drago
how much do i have to pay you to use that?
well tbh i don't know either
im bored
does rarity work?
hey ida would you punch me in the face if i started shipping you with rainy
he got the wrong target.
i just go with w/e
i never knew you were gay ida
you should use my node script to generate random usually-pronounceable character strings
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
both regal and ida are gay i think
i got two gay big sisters yay
one hangs out with me through games and one hangs out with me through vc
poetic
rainy's cute, i don't mind
wait i was dating a trans
hey i held my own in civ
its only rude if the person its referring to finds it rude
a trans?
i dont wanna scroll whats up
so ask someone else
transgender*?
my mistake
you already have a stockpile
best friends would be ida, flubs, stormy, and breana
the answer is violence, dear rc
skarm, language
today a prof told me to make a medicine wheel
haha what a fuckin loser. being mentally stable sometimes. what a nerd
i love queer circles
civil war...you are talking to a friendship and war general
been waiting for a year
this is just kingdom of introverted ninnies: 1 vs. 100
but im like bi polar
i will individually break each and every one of your knuckles
that's uh, most of the reason i made it
ditto with ida and master
i am genuinely happy that they see me like a younger brother
i forgot it
that was suppose to be an insult
that would be awesome
i like trolling hardcore here
in that case do i have you guys' permission to change his name to "drago's toast"
got my hands on nova prime. what do you think of this moon themed fashion frame?
so the reason why i am crazy is because of trauma and me not being able to take orders well
apparently he's also supposed to be 7'03''. i don't think i believe it that much
this is fun
clyde
and when the truth finally dawns
lowering the brightness by like 20% did it
help
she'a dumb and wonderful and spills over the floor
i‚Äôll take your silence as ‚Äúyes‚Äù
here is a good joke
im not human
10,800 seconds until fantastic beasts
if you asked an order of seconds earlier i wouldve signed up
who wants to count down with me
it took me like a half hour to get out of bed this morning
it took me 10 seconds
just kinda...roll right out onto the floor
where did you leave it for that to happen
i am gonna do that
it happened before i lost it i went to class in the rain a bunch of times
mood
but it didn't make that much of an impact and far less people probably played it
i love pie
same, rainy
i think it's that they look at the game with the highest accumulated review score
kingdom of introverted ninnies: civil war
so maybe ones like kotaku's review of the game might be a factor as to how xeno 2 didn't get it instead of dragonquest.
good job
i like beef
thanks i think i was happier not thinking about that
weird
running on the world map that is not like frame rate or anything
i did once
even if i wouldnt like them under any other circumstances
idk maybe im just weird but i never felt any reason to be nice to my parents
in which case its perfectly acceptable
same thing with my dad actually, you would think at first he's the nicest guy on the planet, but when you start to spend time with him, that's when things start to go downhill
would there be a challenge run for pok√©mon or/as
hmm..
oh okay
was a much needed visit because it definitely distracted me from ym stress and stuff and i was feeling lonely as shit this week
personal favorite kind is the one where it only gets funnier and funnier and you  can‚Äôt stop laughing, and you try to stop, making it funnier
that's only three hours are you okay
it‚Äôs always good to get out for a while
me: gets up, sees that it's just after 9 am
i can‚Äôt math rn. it‚Äôs ok lol
never played either. both look ok to me
guys
a bit at two, 3-6, then got up at 7:30
yes flubs you can once i am done with it
also it's 4 am
errrrr
that was the plan
though pls don't upload nsfw
yeet
you are the best
there's your score
also like what do they matter at all
no math just made quantum mechanics make sense to human brains
without the catalyst of math the leaps to get here would never be made, not before the heat death at any rate
wait a minute why is dragonite on the side of the physics engine while im supporting the compiler
math bad
flubs say something funny
i wanna pick a fight with this blade lord person
blade lord nayru*
you should pick a fight with like a bumble bee or something
that is not funny
i wanna hear little dratini stories
i was very close to one though
pogi was the leader
ida wanna talk about pie or something
that was drat‚Äî
i can't forgive that
actually there was more than one person...
its just an example of when sending someone to prison is ok
i mean getting someone sent to prison ruins their life but if they murdered your parents it prolly justified
okay new plan let me dig around
insert obvious joke
tell me more tell me more
so skyrim stream it is when i have time
but resetting every time you accidentally blow lydia off a mountain is annoying
yes i do
why do you own all the dlc if you gave up ten seconds into the base game
gonna teach drago
i rounded down a bit
***hey dragonite did you hear your baby cousin won an award for marching band and was named ceo of earth, incorporated and has a girlfriend*** and by the way are you still like alive and stuff?
so you _did_ beat the tutorial bear
oh hey digging through my pics
or lego¬Æ the lord of the rings‚Ñ¢
which is 100% acceptable by the way
(‚óï Œµ ‚óï)
but dont 100% it because the dunwall city trials are fucking horrible
so don't watch that
i can't play drv3
which are basically semiannual two-week black fridays
but....
ram might go down in price in 2019
how many gb per hard drive do you waste on average?
all of it
no i definitely cant
that's like their whole shtick
ssds have gotten cheaper
fair enough
well if you're ever looking for more harddrive space i think i saw a 1tb ssd somewhere for like $130~140
every day is black friday with newegg
lol wearing socks
not if theyre on the right places
socks are the only garment humanity needs
did you hear someone got sued by nintendo for running a rom site>
its a gross answer you really dont want it
youtube just shitted itself again
ewwww
and ive been trying to get out of those for _decades_
squid arent you boneless though
hi angry i'm etinogard
black bear
why would i watch a show about offices i go to one every day
what show
then the name is a lie
charizard
i am angry
"these people literally behave like my coworkers why would i want to watch it on tv"
the first season sucks flubs
‚Äúfucknugget‚Äù is that a new mcdonald‚Äôs item? <:keepo:327304799919800321>
okay, his favorite food is the fingers of people who aren't as smart as they think they are
> math
and you love the fat guy
i have been inspired this morning
would that be a place that sells like rna bubbles or something
tarantulas can be pets
ida if you don't know what those are you probably dont want to look it up
problem is
wasps. oh wait, that's deadlier
i can be sane when i want to
do you have like an atom bomb i can borrow
drago's pet shop
crap i was in need of a filled soul gem
can someone kill me
also creator studio bullshit is dumb
what does that mean
with a mod
welp
i know
i'm going to leave it that way until march
~~chicken breasts or real ones?~~ <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
that should probably tell you something
actually i expected something worse
yes sis
i got fired after
oh ida hates me today
ping me if you set up a game
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
i could probably find a better one pretty easilyi though tbh
1815 for the first european one
maybe when i have time wednesday
apparently it came back
didnt you only break up like three days ago
flubs we need an anthem after this
i dont know if its kansas but kansas is in one of the two groupings of states that are all the same
hey theres a statue of satan in a public square in kansas or something because of the confederation
drago you are greedy
i eat them so quickly does it even matter
worse.
and master is russia
drago you suck at making a taco
it‚Äôs stupid
i hate film
what is the film class about?
there‚Äôs a lot more info about it than o ever realized
oh damn i'm late i could've subbed in for drago on data structures
sounds like a fun one
without a controller
wait you *aren't* trolling
‚Äúwhat killed the dinosaurs? the ice age!‚Äù
hey hey just because i wanted a tyrannosaurus as a pet at one poitn in my life means it's okay for _everyone_ to do taht
im not
false: it‚Äôs a 51% chance
only skyrim, fo4 and 76 so far run on creation
well i dont like having a beard and facial hair because it's more trouble than it's worth
i'm surprised so many people want warrior.
flubs
and even if its technically a different engine is it really *different*
to me, it's pretty boring, you just swing at shit
but that one wasnt fromt he beginning i thought
so, uh, i wouldn't count on it anytime soon
you played mage
echoes is not the game to start with
just play better 4head
i just dedicate a day to steam games
my recomendation would be awakening since its my favorite and its the one i started with
i'm honestly not that interested in slay the spire
i should work on that
i kind of wanna play 100% orange juice
i'm bored and kind of want to play some multiplayer....
it's kind of boring single player
plus, im super biased towards it
good choice
ya'll are kind of making me want to stream even though i didn't want to tonight, lol
i just woke up from an exhaustion nap, hi eyan
i'm down to  play
it's back, without blank cards
hey eyan, is it still possible we might see you play fire emblem?
trust is not something you can always win back, especially if you screw up bad enough.  knowing your track record, i know what i'd be putting money on
they all left me
wheres my money then
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
yup but the plan this time was to fix it
blind luck
is reddit down?
all i can think of every time you bring this up
that might take a week
password?
more
thats the 26
like he literally just said
linked in
no i just send death threats to it whenever it pms me about shit
true
i dont wanna get the thing tho
nonsense it's just soda poured on your hamburger so you dont have to eat them separately
we are all terrible. we are the hive.
round 2 rn
good lord squid
rainy
hmmm
also did the rules change? i appear to be getting the cards that i play but are not selected returned to me
the linkedin thing has a bunch of tags you can search by
exit
its not a murder if its by accident
nobody cares about grammar
i understand how it works now
based off who the czar was
it was the card i drew that turn
oh my god
god bless rngesus
you need communication, an owlbear, and communication with said owlbear
about 33% chance of this being the last round
oh ida forgot to leave and rainy is typing
how motivating
can you guys remove me on nov 23?
nerds
gn ida
well do it sooner rather than later, and by that i mean throw in the towel
all i have so far
wait
somebody
does this black card not even matter to y'all?
him and panda were both at 7/8
i poked through the source in the inspect element button lat time i was the card czar
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
(‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
dammit
not a single expression
just a couple times every update
its great
in other news it turns out that telling a computer to figure out if two angles are close-ish to each other is _ass_
a bunch of scientists did a study once about why we sleep and after a ridiculous amount of time and grant money they concluded that it was "because we feel sleepy"
kugal are you a fan of modulo division
me: ok it's midnight i should go sleep
i really like the way gamepad drivers don't give you the angle that an analog stick is pointing and just make you do all the math yourself
from scratch
is it a vape  or something
he got paid for it too
once a _month?_
i think these stat questions are legit broken
well, ,i missed the last sat test for this year. so at this rate, i'm not going to be able to apply for college next year
i know that feeling
i don't think we have one of those nearby in corn central
the only test i had to take was an accuplacer and bam that was good nuff
not dead
i havent played a pokemon game for years ):
darn, i wanna play games rn
so you pay to have a chance to pay to go to college
just dont take the tests
fair enough, rc.
societal pressure, higher-paying jobs, dream jobs/careers, etc.. take your pick
not higher paying jobs for college?
did your ds charger not reach the wall outlet or something
basically something that you could do in glsl and expect to work the way you intended it
neither are as easy as that
i can talk about generics and abstract data types all day dammit
i was gonna say something about doing what makes you happy no matter the cost but yeet
life
and liberty and the pursuit of happiness
the physics gnomes went on strike so gravity on venus is whatever it wants to be
yeah, who knows when that thing will get pissed and attack you
yes, because venus isnt as massive as the earth
wait
that's most likely wrong
its not dependent on if its a planet or not
well we're not taking the atmosphere into consideration
different acceleration due to gravity
yo momma thinks square roots are vegetables
everything that exists that has mass has a force of gravity
so the moon isnt a planet because it doesnt orbit the sun, and pluto isnt a planet because its too small
why arent stars in solar systems with two stars planets
that‚Äôs what kids do: repeat the same shit a million times until someone yells at them
brb vacuuming up the planet's atmosphere so sound can't penetrate it
but whys it a planet then
i'll just need a death star-sized bag that's all
first, they got to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people saying how terrible fallout 76 is
or they could just give me the code for the updated creation engine without all of the assets in it
theres nothing on yt i want to watch. send help
oh my god, ,the score for the ps4 version...
it also doesnt matter because the atmosphere would dissolve your bones on venus before you hit the ground
keep in mind i was like 8 lmao
big yes
im good (:
it is currently painful to keep my eyes open
ok so the moon isnt a planet but has gravity. but rocks in space dont have gravity. why not.
i named my sister voldemort in my contacts and now i flinch every time she sends me a message
but you also didnt say all your suggestions would be as horrible as they are
alright so i have to make a decision today. do i just eat turkey cold cuts with instant gravy on top or do i make myself an entire turkey and eat the same thing for a month
serious is subjective
one channel i've gotten into the last few days is mother's basement
oh, i love the amount of chaos you can get from the crowd control extension on twitch
ew rom hacks
three tiles
oh right, warframe is on the switch now
speaking of pokemon tho
i havent eaten at all today. this sucks.
aight well ive got 50 minutes so ill go start now
i'm bored
cant
join vc
yes i know its terrible
he was a nice kid. gross though
how do you pat harshly
also my nemesis is here
or that one
wack
it's the one from mario
that everybody hates
that's hammer bros and bloopers
:boxthinking:
so far ive got a penguin, a bat, a little...thing? i dont know what youd define it as, a kangaroo like thing, and a light fixture
sure idk its name
ive heard people refer to it as someone between 20 and 30
whatever that means
i think the last one has a story behind it
just not happy
i almost did that once fortunately the imposter site was trash and looked nothing like what the actual site looked like and i figured it out pretty quickly
i'm definitely creating enemies with the let's go base atm
hi yes i‚Äôm a band man. can confirm woodwinds are the worst (like it just ends there at truth)
most of the time i am still asleep by the time it starts
~~now why would you accuse twitch grandpa of something like that?~~
speaking of bad man, some people in their patreon server might send stephen a shirt with ‚Äúbadman‚Äù on it. and mal is in on it üòõ
i need to be at breakfast stream more
nier automata is 50% off
but i hate to completely toss away ss completely.  i think the best way to handle those comments is to just prove them wrong this time
makes sense to me.
my plan was to put together a smaller dream team than last time, preferably a more manageable one.  pretty much anybody who's a mod somewhere is at least part of the discussion though.
you take away my modship so you can kick me off the team
lemme check
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
bella what i havent eaten breakfast since 2014
is it really super secret though
i don't want emotions antymore
not anymore
oh it's not grey
i opened skype the other day and my eyes threw up
when is later?
just find out how messy her house is and make yours messy to the same degree and she won't notice
i just remembered today is when we get stuffing.
~~so you‚Äôre a hoarder?~~
just make it as messy as mine
so all of the things that i'm probably going to be awful at
so prepare for reading
i ain‚Äôt doing good at understandin‚Äô your language
he'll never make it past that step
i‚Äôm so ready
flubs is a myth
or he‚Äôll get stuck at anger
france is still a relevant country
though always wanted to be a girl for a day
now i look as superior as i am
and it's working
im not a pony
oh flubs great news i got a new right hand man
i think i will teach him how to be like me
i threw so many tantrums yet always get something or someone i wanted
that is not how that works
makes sense to me
she‚Äôs gonna tease me
yeah but i get to eat at dinner time not lunch time
i always hated thanksgiving which is weird because its a lot of cooking which i love. but i hate eating so early and then being hungry at like 1 in the morning
and a bunch of stuffing and turkey and shit
he wont?
where is my invitation?
i just noticed how much food im making
this also lets me play pocket monsters all day
yeah not a fan personally
unfortunately you
or creep her out ifk
what did i juat walk in on
what about your pink?
you can give him money now and then flaunt it later
that is a combination of red and less red
role red
cousins annoy drago
god no
you do that while i make my new anthem
and put them all in the same room
i hate it
new jersey accent
yeah that ones integration assigned, ida
yeah thanksgiving in canada is not what it is down there
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
wow narcissistic much
im thankful for ponies, my pony friends, war, and muskets
im thankful for flubs
ehh she spelled cornucopia correctly so its ok
some people give me a weird look when i do it irl since they can hear me whisper it
flubs what should i buy tomorrow?
oh flubs tomorrow is cyber monday
black friday
if you dont need goggles normally you arent cooking right
easy
but one of them went home and there is now 33% less dog in the building
lol ida
or your skin
bc im gonna put a hat on one but im not sure which yet
dan?
tomorrow is black friday so i gotta go to best buy
the closest one is string cheese dan
tomorrow is national stay at home day
except we're going to see fantastic beasts for the second time so i actually wont
because i know 0 people from that state
i keep hearing word about it, is it worth watching?
i saw it already, dragonite
but he is not awake as the same time as me
bc like you gotta celebrate christmas right? but idfk how to do any of that shit besides the food
just took a calculus quiz but i feel like 3 of the questions were messed up
both
i dont mind turkey, its good, but i looked at what we're having and it looks 10 times better
stuffing indeed
stuffing? what is it?
kugal youve only eaten like 3 foods shut
its food and it is goddamn amazing
stuffing is life
then i remembered you're canadian
there we go
mr food expert
whats the word. pm me it
mr food expert
i should probably drag my right hand man here for protection
master
help i want more pie
im definitely gonna be even a bigger pain
alright lets make this easy for you then
he still has an alt somewhere around here that he mentioned earlier
this is interesting
do i want to know?
thats a nice way to put it majestic haha
fourth of july is only american in name
fair point.
also sometimes we get fireworks on thanksgiving around here
other countries dont have a fourth of july they only have a third and a fifth
happy capitalism.day
we shouldnt have months and just have 365.241 days every year
but even so
that wont work out
just hit the middle ground
rainy i'm going to force you to re-watch the movie over and over until you change your mind
the one i use way more
there's still time to learn to hate python
functional 9/10
no, cause par doesn't originate from golf
why am i bad at everything
well he doesn't seem to mind
duck
indeed. welcome.
what's it on?
the last lesson was on hypothesis testing between two samples, both independent and paried
your course was pretty damn fast. we're only gonna get to integrals this monday
but i couldn't do it last night because mystatlab was under maintenance
just break webassign until he gives up using it
next semester im going into calculus ii
hey were always blue for me
that‚Äôs some dark stuff lol
guys did youtube change the color of these buttons or am i going mad
your face is infinity
yeah what i said is infinity but in math form
there will be a good amount of limit questions
like master said: everything is derivatives
one of my wisdom teeth just came in and i dont mind it
which is more differentiation lmao
everything else is built off of that
ive started getting fancy with how i eat the same 3 foods
but dont like it that much
how much mass in kilograms remains in your leftovers?
oh definitely
and be stuck with my great-aunt?
i made libre office pissed at me with a 3gb ram sheet
you know what's the absolute 100% best feeling in the world
either that or ill go into server settings when nobody's looking and add a greener nu role or whatever it's called
thanks
that's actually pretty rare
pretty much all of the reviews on all of the final fantasy games on steam say one of two things
that was me the entirety of bio a few years ago
jokes on you ive been dead for years
do it for the tense pre-presentation college students
some professors make you memorize them and suffer
annotations were the big boxes?
youre right they did it because it doesnt work on the devices that account for more than half of all playbacks, _and_ most of the others don't use them
that's a weird way of describing "the period before it's due"
annotations were ass
in essence, today is a mess?
that way you have to be less on guard all month for packages
just check the comments of the wooly world videos
welp, guess emile's comment sections now will be flooded with chuggaaconroy cultists. not sure how i feel about that
curse mobile and making it hard to show that
i think it's just average
also i got a confirmation email saying im enrolled in calc ii, so thats neato. now i just gotta take my calc i final and kick butt and do my best and then i'll be on the road to more math lol
how the heck is 100 average
no one knows why
as far as i can tell
im saying some would if 0 was the average
cause that's hilarious
i definitely do because im an idiot but for fucks sake just move the scale to a better place
but does a 0 baseline not make more sense than a 100 baseline
its stupid where it is. keep everything the same, just move everyones iq down by 100
intelligence quotient
so it's impossible to get negative numbers
bollocks im not green anymore
it makes me happy that two-year-old me is on average smarter than now-me
well, at a certain point it starts to decrease
the system was proposed by a psychologist
do you mean _your_ arms dont functionas swords
gotta make an email that wont be taken but will be looked at without being assumed to be spam
making throwaway emails is hard
wow. ive never applied to schools before and it‚Äôs kinda very scary
ok cool
nothin much whats up with you
not trying to one up the suffering contest
i mean that'd be kinda cool now would it
hmmmmmmm
alright so i finally came back to my third run on emerald
also no greninja & charizard this time
i‚Äôve used all of those except for delphox
delphox is the one with a wand or something right?
i was also so tempted to make azumarill a temporary team member yet again and choose crawdaunt instead
even then i haven‚Äôt played either in a really long time
i had to do one of those stall battles against his milotic with my walrein
my game carts battery is dry
they use it?
yeah, i still think the sequels in gen 5 are better than the originals
the general opinion in the pok√©mon fan base that i strongly disagree with is that gen 5 is the best and gen 4 is the worst
the final boss was better
every game needs a mod that will randomly launch skyrim on any blackout/death
if did not go well.
lol, i get them regularly
ehh, i either loved or hated the changes (or lack of change)
but that doesn't mean i will like it as a final boss
this is almost the exact same fight as we had recently
some people were annoyed with the changes to lusamine also
~~i think you mean climax boss~~
i thought the story in sun and moon was better than black and white. i just can‚Äôt be with everyone calling that the best story
and i haven‚Äôt bought a pok√©mon game in years
and with the let‚Äôs go games selling 3 million copies fast, i think it‚Äôs safe to say we will be seeing more let‚Äôs go games
also it was already confirmed that the 8th gen games will have a different engine to let's go and that they will be the best looking games in the series so far
i think people were just amazed pokemon was in 3d
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i am convinced that they just look sun and moons engine and made let's go in hd
i don‚Äôt really like saying communities are toxic, because every single one has its terrible fans, but yeah, some parts of the pok√©mon fandom are awful
hahahahaha no
let‚Äôs go looked more like x&y in hd to me
anything popular, labelled toxic. even when it's a relatively great community
irrelevent
also to be fair
you have to play a game to give a score
sorry if my phrasing was bad
the most toxic and moronic nintendo sub community
-rideable pokemon
·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
since they‚Äôre not optional in tv mode
-following pokemon
btw were the motion controls a turn off for you also squid
i made a whole team of 6 follow you around once that was a glorious mess
hephaestus
because he's like perpetually drunk and that would explain a lot
greek is better
brb getting food
personally i'd call in archimedes
it‚Äôs manageable for what characters it‚Äôs got
ted talk? this doesn't really feel like one of those
essentially, greeks are cooler
welcome to masters, bellas, and dragonites ted talk
greek seems to have stuck the most, but it certainly spread tech progress across the isolated nations a solid amount
truly too ahead of their time
are you comparing roman nanotechnology to bird doo
we can map out the entire chicken genome, put it onto a computer, then broadcast that via wifi which is really radio which is really electromagnetic radiation. thus you can radio people chicken shit
algettu has been revitalized
honestly the last half hour of talk in here is what enhasa should be like
darn
i wonder if youtube api allows you to get a list of discord users from those that join a channel
which ones enhasa
d position/dt = velocity | d velocity /dt = acceleration | d acceleration/dt = jerk
oh well maybe we just havent advanced far enough as a society to make use of inte or polo
i was curious to see if my calculator could do large sums so i inputted an infinite sum only to 100000 terms and it the calculator took 20 minutes to evaluate the sum
here let me get the sum
lemme c++ that real quick
master you do it for me im tired
probably
is that not what you entered
lucius appuleius saturninus, a tribune, passes a law to redistribute land to military veterans. the law requires that all senators swear to abide by it. quintus caecilus metellus numidicus refuses and is exiled. he goes to rhodes to study philosophy.
we're all going to die anyway
even if ya did then it still shouldnt be that high of a number lol
that‚Äôs santa marine crustacean to you
i dont have a good word for it but its too round i guess
i need a nice corner couch to work on

hahaaaaahhh
fun prank
this is about the purity test, isn't it?
and what is the score of 15 from? the roman thing?
you *must* know what that is
thats a new low for you
it takes being the most horrible to have that moniker
well,
i've got to work morning concessions tomorrow. because we need basketball games in like 9 in the fucking morning, an elementary game at that
but as for why they have them, i'm guessing it's because they think their job is the greatest of all tiiimmemeee
done
didn't help also that it took forever to get the nature and ability i wanted for my azurill also which needed to be happy to evolve, so that was fun with all of that walking xp
is it me drago?
like why do i need to justify everything with this guy lmao
radio silence speaks volumes
you can say it
rainy i hate to say this
only after accepting your low lewdness stat can you grow it
i prefer not being arrested
let's try and get eyan in, it's friday
(ssh, not here, rainy)
(maybe later)
you underestimate how dumb i am
so you're like 80% of the way there already
though asthma makes nerds, not nerds get asthma
i have one semester's experience with uni compsci
i feel exhausted but i only got through day 1 of 5 days of working in a row. again üòë
canary or default?
(‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°‚úø)
that‚Äôs how i am right now
also aaa the second half of the last episode was pretty good but now its so boring
squid stop hating things
this will be on r/enlightenedbirdmen by the end of the week
shut up it's owls
i'm a month and a half into this run and it's been exceptionally smooth
nobody yet
you should use me as your meat shield because i'm probably the skinniest person ever
the worst part was bella got hurt really bad by the assassin which knocked her out for a while but other than that, it's been smooth
kugal died on the streamed xcom run a few weeks back.  this is a run i started up on my own time because i was craving more xcom
is it a coincidence that deci just came online or are you two planning on league?
as soon as i get a chance
hooray time for another round of me putting off contacting any of you until sunday afternoon when everyone's packing up
just find the fountain of eternal life
also buh bye ida
i look wonderfully grumpy, thank you
you think that's bad? i'm just gonna drive 24 hours and kick in their room door
i‚Äôm already argonian
how do you say "cheese" in dovahzul
i thoguht your original discord username was really clever until i saw a couple other people with the same name =/
super nerd army
also i can also confirm that the friends suck ass in this game
just guess san diego enough times and youll eventually be right
i hope so
what the crap twitch
who remembers when memes had effort put into them
oddly appropriate then
yeah me neither
also what happened to not worrying about details and "fuck it just do it" in regards to youtube?
it still takes some details ya ninny
what else was there
no its just old fashioned
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
rainy just popped online
you guys are up late
perfect
dont have time to wonder into the  endless vastness of space
romans didnt know it existed lol
cool
iv unit, extra large, liquid crystal display, direct message
have you seen how romans counted with their hands before
alll valid abbreviations in modern language
ive counted to 4 in binary on my fingers a few times
also doesnt matter if you use thumb or pinky as 2^0
weird til "our" and "your" are only off by one letter
something something noose nice
good for compression i guess
you can sleep in now
you can sleep in gym
oh wait no that would have to be nouse
i didnt realize this until my current 3 heart run, but oot ganondorf has quite a big nose when looking at it
most video game characters do
welcome, have a baconator üçî
made it myself.
is it gilgamesh?
here's a gilgamesh one.
ida would you murder me if i asked what a gilgamesh is
my parents recently got new speakers for the living room so they‚Äôve been playing music loudly every night for the past couple of days üòê
what happens if it gets full
my mom would break physics

not here
do famous astronomers
~~name a dratini after me~~
yeah but it's about eleven characters too long
greekid
hubble, galileo, brahe, kepler, etc
think about it dragonite, going to go eat, get back to me later when i stream
all of them, but sceptile probably won't get much use
it's very bad
we're live by the way
i‚Äôll be watching the stream after i finish watching raw
connect your twitch to discord
oh, how do?
does that bot help with music theory and the resolution of v7 chords?
i shoudl teach him to pick apart subjects, predicates and conjunctions and jam them together to produce semi-intelligent unique dialogue
i can but im not gonna do that quite yet,
i wish
til boxbox watches chugga

that aloix guy is a fucking loser
too bad
just finished decorating one of our two christmas trees and found an old ornament from when my mom was young. a wooden cow. 
the teacher is talking about fishing with a guy who isn't in the class
very mooooving
is that going on right now?
squid i'm going to have to remoooooove you from the gene pool
this is interesting
so i told my teacher that i'd put documentation comments in the branch of the class repository i was working on so whichever poor sap who's unlucky enough to have to merge it back in doesn't want to punch me in the face
oh human
first come, first serve.  makes sense for this sort of thing.
i don't have much left and i'm going completely from memory because i'm at work
just my shorthand "draco" would suffice.  i know it's not fitting for a metagross, but it's less complicated that way.
now tell me a story
but they won't get much use so i was thinking of giving them to my not so active but big time past donators
not really a "story" per se, but you were the first person i watch on youtube ever and for the first few months, the only person i watched.
well you don't actively make videos right now. üòú
same
and i wish for the best on that.
now that's a good story.  üòõ
i can only beat most of them on normal.  i have beaten a few extra stages and hard runs on the easier games though
i found your stream randomly, you were doing solo queue for league and wearing your teemo had.
i feel lonely, sad, and bitter, despite being surrounded my a lot of awesome people.
i'm sort of in a similar position, only with college instead of work.
well hopefully i'm doing a decent job at distracting you.
i'd be lying if i said i didn't have a lot of fears about it though
i'm worried that nobody will care, the world has changed around me quite a bit, but from a youtube perspective, i'm still the same old derpy kid who just wants to screw around with videos
i appreciate that.  right now, i think support is all i need
it seems like a huge liability, lol
rainy, you are one of the most important people in my life
i am here
i couldn't sleep right now anyways
what?
yeah eyan, i'll cover for you, i'm off, go grab a nap
i avoid it like the plague
chamomile tea. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
you heard it here first folk.
i will admit though, i'm surprised how chatting with you guys isn't actually hurting my productivity that much
yup, i do it all the time in the kitchen, knife in one hand, phone in the other
yo eyan, ping me wherever if you want, i'm get a tiny bit more sleep
i'm usually 8-4 if i'm in the front, or 6-3/4ish if i'm in the kitchen
plenty of sleep time
that sounds dreadful
the end
somebody
hey nerds
tis a good story
bella!
i‚Äôm on the bus right now, it‚Äôs been raining pretty much for a whole day and thankfully there‚Äôs no one on the sidewalk. it‚Äôs like a full on tidal wave
no thanks
i love snow though, it's just what the doctor ordered for my crippling depression
i couldn't live somewhere where 50 was considered freezing cold
50 sounds good when you‚Äôre stuck in the 30s all winter
what‚Äôs the hottest it gets around there?
i'd rather move north if i had to go anywhere
i said special twice
it sounds lewd
wow, choosing that over me, i see how it is
it's been a rough week.  >_<
definitely
just human
oh god, that's terrible
nobody should want to be reincarnated as me
it's at least good that you're venting, though
so that was neat
besides, i'm not stupid, i'll be in a call with friends to watch over me.
it‚Äôs good to get it out
oh you‚Äôre working right now? didn‚Äôt know that
eyan, outta curiosity, do you see a therapist?
so, to answer the question, some days it can be my entire shift, other days, not as much.  i'm "accounts payable" though so my job is pretty much just to pay bills
that‚Äôs special
i have a bad habit of finding an excuse to not see one
i legitimately think i'm doing swell enough though that i don't think it's worth my time
it's beginning of the month so we get a lot of monthly bills around this time so i've been building up for the last few days to a day of just sitting around posting them
much cheaper solution
learn to drive
how long does that take? like, does that take your whole shift or just most of it?
understood
working out does good things, therapy wise
i've been able to talk to my mom about my issues
thanks guys
no it's called fun mode
i can‚Äôt imagine one side of the county to another
i can obviously do more, but it'd have to be a special circumstance
since she knew exactly what i was going through
i tried driving briefly but it was way too stressful for me
holy crap it's brad
shouldn‚Äôt be too bad
so now i take the bus
i can do more, i just learned that once i got to about 3 hours, i started not liking it anymore
i know it's not the brad i know, lol
this may not be the brad you know
driving is fun for a while
i can drive for about 30 minutes alone in the car before i get really depressing thoughts
money
dont die eyan
why not fly if you have to drive 7 hours?
f
try a 9 hour plane ride
oh fuck guys, i think eyan's actually dead
i usually stop at a denny's in middle of nowhere wyoming
oh no eyan is dead
i'm a capitalist at heart
and i'm sure she wouldn't mind paying interest anyways
wow, way to assume and talk about me like i'm not here
i mean
i try my best
you aren't wrong
i'm pretty sure she was just looking for an excuse to agree to giving me that in the first place.  üòõ
you bastard
gift horses? are you planning on sending eyan a horse for christmas? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but "no futher punishment" is not a complete sentence
you‚Äôre not a compl
i‚Äôm not allowed to do anything around here
ill be back in about half an hour if i get through volunteer duty fast
i'm a grinch, who needs santa hats
good job (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
also
yeah
you getting called up would have been something
although i kind of prefer the more...natural kind
i demand that somebody tell me a story
kinky
both of them
there once was a hero named ragnar the red
i demand the story of ragnar the red stop
once upon a time, a squid had to get ready for work. the end
i want an original story
guys, i think i just hit the lottery
too many scales for me
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
ok here's a story i'm recycling right now and the teacher decided to take a shortcut through the blizzard to go grab bags for recycling
impressive
wow lewd
try setting it on fire
wait
also nice unintentional double entendre
i watch them for the same reason you watch gross surgery videos. you know its gonna suck to watch but you just cant look away
that's the maids job
i thought at least jake would be in it
well they arent that popular and have caused a lot of problems for youtube
jake was in it; at least the last couple of episodes
yo fuck thats a good point
also bella, not a kitten
he wanted to come with us
she is a cat
high five
the cat _is_ the maid
didnt she fucking murder subaru though eyan
like i know it was a misunderstanding but she still murdered him pretty hard
and my body
only payment i have is love, is that acceptable?
i'll pay for all of your needed maid expenses
beacon of feminism as i am, i've always wanted to be a maid
i could be like the butler who always falls asleep and plays ds games on the job or something
i can cook and clean like a goddess
i forgot i could do that
i like maids
of course to keep it in proportion youd have to remove the forearms and the middle of the torso
hey, not quite ;-;
and how tall is ida?  lol
we are strong independent women
6' 1"
i feel like i really want to know what some of you look like
yeah but i could‚Äôve been like... 5‚Äô10
so maybe rem is more apt
my cousins have giants for parents so they‚Äôre all tall and it‚Äôs annoying
i think one of them is nearly 7 feet
just means you can attack the abdomen easier
now we need a disappointed head butler. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
secretary, coo, depends on the year, but i'm always trying to do something useful
he's the butler
hey 9k
yeah, but i'm sure he would prefer dark lord of the sith and hand of the emperor
rainy had a soul? this is news to me
cats
not anymore
you ca be the daedric prince of cats
eyan, daedric prince of walkthroughs and ninnies
indeed
that's molag bal's domain
i don't really know what i want
for somebody to fill the void of emptiness in my life
well i'm pretty tight with azura, and she knows all bout that void shit
love made with  pizza sounds mediocre at best
not attracted to me, i see how it is
nice
cause holy fuck i make amazing pizza
sounds to me like you're killing two birds with one stone
that's an odd form of precipitation
i get the feeling you secretly want to actually be my maid, lol
just roll with it
hey you're  cute hon
i am merely a man of class
it's not my fault you have shit tastes realmaster
public class lower{
but i've got an ass that you need to install a mod for
eyan;
i never said i disliked ass, just i'm more of a boobs guy, lol
that's why i prefer boobs
i would do that shit seconds before it's due
good job
you done with work?
\*and he was never heard from again\*
did ya guys see youtube rewind 2018 came out today lol
later, eyan.
hay thats a plus
i used to watch his stuff as well back in the day.
would i be bombarded by people‚Äôs surprise if i said i have never heard it before
<:kappaclaus:520412032042926080> and <:kingofchristmas:520412492787089408> are here for the holidays
panda is alive
audible gasp.
how is red dead 2's music and art better than god of war's?
just dont watch shit you dont like, and if you do want to watch it for whatever fucking reason, dont make it our problem
guys it dawns on me that maybe eating a large amount of coffee ice cream just before midnight might not have been the best idea i ever had
and proud of it
i just want you all to know i went to bed at 6 so i could wake up at 1 am and play smash until work at 4:30 am
so i‚Äôm not allowed to not like something popular? don‚Äôt act like you never go through it
it could be quite terrible so don't be too excited.  üòõ
but that's being human imo
~~if it makes you feel better, i would probably be worse~~
current game plan for salvation of the project is making 3d models then getting the angle just right to have them align with an existing stock photo of a person using a product
here, anyway
his channel was my childhood
will we get the old camera filming the top screen? lmao
we'll see, the theme of right now is "screw it, just do it"
it's people like you who stop by and remind me that i'm still remembered for what i accomplished so long ago
and sometimes it makes threats
you got two parts in and then stopped.
i've certainly gotten salty because of popularity for things i didn't care about.  it's not really a logical train of thought though, that much i will admit.  dragonite is right, why drain energy into caring about what's popular
emile goes on a noa rant for two minutes and fifteen seconds
this is important
ooof, drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.  how could i forget the golden rule
gday m8
i really should sleep aaaaa
\:thinking\:
not sure how to feel about that
i think reality is slapping me over the face again
probably like, the end of my yt career level video combined with early yt career level editing
that didn't work
no more than normal at least
edit yourself
not a half bad idea
i wish i could edit myself
make me
\:thinking\:
next final after this is my calculus final
my birthday always sucked cause it was always pretty much guaranteed to be right after winter break.  it was different in college though so that was nice
ah, the best kind of reward
good luck friend
oh nice
the college classes usually start later than my highschool semester but they also end earlier too
oh boy, calculus ii here we come
but i legit thought i failed my calculus i midterm but got 97%
i fucked up the curve several times in one of my entry level finance classes
i was quite proud of myself, especially for coasting the later half
friggin hell yea man
thats not too shabby
otherwise i would have failed it miserably, lol
except for that one semesters in freshman year in highschool
oras starting now <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
gotta eat breakfast, bbl
probably after i start uploading to youtube again
to me i saw 'breakfast' and it's fairly early where i am so i was like "yea makes sense" in my head lul
this stream made a bunch of people join
i wonder what would happen if i went around introducing myself as "mr spam"
i‚Äôm back from work. eyan still streaming?
i said skarmory, not skarm jesus christ
hola y'all
calculated that back in june
oh i've come to terms with this revelation a loooooooong time ago pal
there is no reasonable hour
perfect thanks
did you record a black screen again eyan
soon‚Ñ¢
then if your local recording doesnt have sound you can pull down the video from twitch, extract the track with just the game audio, and use that
why do anything simple when you can overcomplicate it
<:lul:305559915714576385>
‚Äîdragonite family motto
welp
üéâ ?
i remember
congrats
welcome
welcome to the show
why does it mention that you have the everyone role
i feel like most people have that one
you know it occurs to me that if i didnt procrastinate my homework earlier i'd be able to join stream now
i‚Äôll try it first, but thank you
if you send me the original pic i can do this with a better resolutino
what if someone sets twitch on fire?
all of them
or the finger one
you mean the finger lakes? because those exist <:kappa:374346980136058893>
engrossing
specifically the middle one
50 mins
that‚Äôs west coast
what _does_ this coast hve
darn it squid
is it really
yes! thank you kugal i thought i was the only one
dang it it‚Äôs for the holiday spirit guys
that was a fun stream
when i got promoted
squid everyone knows governments work best when theres two leaders with opposing views who dont want the other one to win
there‚Äôs like 3
you decimated it
it was a 100 question ap chem test
lmao
i mean think about it. being a great runner but your name not being recognizable makes it easy to hunt people for sport but not get recognized while people snatching
fair point
at least the assignment i got 72 on only dropped my grade by 0.5% so my calc grade still sits at a nice 97.53%
so how are all the non-sick people doing?
and if you get spotted what are they gonna say? "5'7" white guy in his late 20s with an average build" like theyre gonna be able to find you out based on that
man im really out of touch?
whats counts as being dead on the inside?
i think it‚Äôs a myth
yet another boss healthbar
crustaceans can't play video games silly
sounds fun, but i don't think that story even has an ending
wow dragonite
*grumble*  morning
well, you are his creator
skarm, try again
he learns from the best
yeah, no kidding
is it a euphemism for fart or something idk butts dont usually giggle
i mean, i was the one who came up with the term gigglebutt, lol
ok, i must go work now
wow rude
but he gives out free hugs sometimes
well i'm not working today
cause i haven;t gotten this weeks schedule
spreadsheets actually require energy right now for me.  v_v
i had to bother a company twice for a model, got it with half the dimensions missing, did pixel measurements for the rest, made the 3d model and now i need to orient it and throw it back into a stock photo using the product plus our accessory
i need more confidence, and maybe a map
i actually have an irl friend now, it's kinda weird
thanks
exactly
otherwise i'm just really tall and awkward
i couldn't tell you a single thing about pretty much any presentation i ever watched
i dunno, i'm in a weird state right now
to fix it.
i could flip my loneliness to  smothered by far more attention that i could ever desire, lol
honestly, if i could have touhou powers of some sort, i probably would just be content being my own little god
imagine the chaos that perfect possession would case in the world.
i appreciate the company though
on the other hand
very true.
how dare they only charge us 6% tax
new show: eyan 24/7
as does everyone else.
i'm also going to have learn to trust people again, lol.  i'm way too stubborn with wanting to do everything myself
i know the feeling.
fair enough.  üòõ
eyan we already have the plans, you have only to tell me to <:doit:334014889137930240>
i dunno
what do i look like, a genius?
no worries.
have fun
and scanned
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
not really, it missed a page
i could also easily assist in that department
hrm...  alone i'm not too sure, but if i were working with someone on revising it, i'd feel more confident because we can bounce ideas off each other.
but if i start doing the weekly series, it could come into play
i'll put it into mental filing cabinet #254. üòõ
gday mate
what's new in your world?
how'd ya do?
it's a little rough but it's not like i'm doing anything else with my pitiful existence so may as well.
noice
as in my major?
got some friends that are really good at it
thankfully we did have to produce it. there would be no way
dude, film school is even crazier han that animal man
film was fun,
sheesh.
people also complained that it took too long to cover a game, which, i mean, that could be arguably a fair critism
thankfully i stopped before i got to that level but the production of things is just overwhelming looking
usually people only complained about that for new games though
all hail bob ross
hopefully being a little older and wiser will make it easier this go round if i succeed again
crystal meth
i must let the words of our glorious bob ross ring true, i can do anything that i want to do.
you did this to yourself
that isn't illegal either
with how the building is?
it's true, constantly
did you know it's possible to physically move a solar system, one day the human race may say "we do it because we can" and move the sun
heyah
moving the solar system how far? it's kinda already in motion
we do celebrate christmas... and the russian version of christmas... and new years... and the russian old new year... there's a lot of drinking
jello
maybe it's a sign lol
just a spoiler in general
no way
i agree
lower that to 5 too
compooter benig dumb ill do it in a minute
and a lack of willingness to debug
guess who just got smash
feels like its been 12/10 forever
the last thing is to write  my 3 minute speech about it
i should just drop bot.js in the master branch of the repository and let everyone else figure out why it's there
yeah anyway homework bye
aaaaaaaaand this discord server is now at the top of my servers
it's calculus lol
oh, it's mee6
it's funny because he's pink nu
yay thank you
fucking moron
don't worry flubs
medz plus more meds sounds great
you are definitely gonna die today
yeah but is it quick and painless or is it slowly stop being able to breathe until all my muscles stop working and i lie there immobile as my brain stops
cuz id rather the first tbh
well, glas to know the tanuki leaf is called the super leaf in ultimate
well that is bullshit
i see
mesothelioma has become a meme now
i mean i dont really even get it all i know is im dying but it also doesnt hurt so who cares
well do you know if it is a short or long period
so you live till 40
and i mean theres always the chance i get hit by a bus or burned at the stake for witchcraft or something
it's just on netflix
just as an fyi
just like seven deadly sins
oh i wasnt there today but im stuck_in_a_box_
why am i still awake?
if the default healing spell costs 1 magic per second, how many points of magic do you spend after casting it continuously for 3.5 seconds
it's be beautiful
i have work tomorrow but it still isnt late
also i lowered the shanty odds
if i had a choice id have benny rip out my throat
nah t posing in front of a freight train
however no one said anything about giotines
and theres gotta be a maximum age for most people right? probably before you turn 12 if i had to guess
fun story my friend almost died by booking it into a tree and breaking his nose and forehead. there was blood everywhere and that is when i discovered that death is a thing
also here's a memefrom 2011
so i would say that's about right
i was i cant do math in 2011
i got this tablet when i was 8 and i found it in my attic because my phone noped the fuck out
i mean my phone was a cheap 300 dollar samsung
forknife has some problems but its the best one out there
that i paid 200 for
what about like your spine or something
did i ever tell you guys the story about how my sister punched me in the nose
said nobody ever
what the crap cats
my dog did it once
so therefore rainy is correct
only dumb dogs
oh you meant like...ohh
good job
no, with birds, obviously
oi, try singing on those choir stands for 20 to 30 minutes with no lumbar support
the programming community should band together to destroy the evil
ive seen it. its pretty good
attempt mage
watching my class trying to put everyone's code together is excruciating
thanks buddy
you know i realize i could log in on the school computer and not have to type on my phone
theres a non purpose?
how many hours do you think i have on ultimate <:gwsetmyxpeepoevil:405337570952740864>
if youre not playing it now the answer is "not enough"
on purpose?
oh good
i am playing it rn, tho
and an sd card
i have put quite a few other games on the  sd card, tho
i got a 128 gb sd card for this game
although i guess with the switch that's probably at least in part because the thing is tiny
i have like a 4 gb card for my 3ds
i would have like that
~~but it can be better~~
i did that on saturday
can one of you just sort of radio the video output of your skyrim game into my brain or something
gonna be honest i completely forgot how to skyrim after 700+ hours of warframe
you‚Äôd still get the best thing and use those buttons for others anyway
ggez
that it is
wait crap when did it become 11 pm
how many
the rewind has over 9.9 million dislikes
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
help
i just did it
hooray for interpreted languages not making sure your variables are spelled right at compile time, because there is no compile time
oh skarm
then do the best sneaky cosplay there ever was!
i can make the next half hour disappear though with a lunch break.
it‚Äôs snowing. why must it snow?
whatever happens happens i guess lol
every day is christmas
morning? my day is mostly done
definitely
you should totally talk to us
how does one get a 100% in english
you too huh?  üòõ
well, i wish thee luck friend
one of my friends is like barely hanging onto straight a's
honestly, not everybody should.  i've quickly learned that anybody can make a decent living even if they aren't smart.
he'll be fine then.  meanwhile, i'm sitting here thinking that i didn't have a job until 23 if you don't count youtube
i would consider it a job because you are/were making an income at one point which in my book sounds like what a job does lol
i'm tirrrrrred
my appetite has hit the gutter though.  i've lost 5 pounds in the past week and a half.  i'm okay with that though, i was slowly adding weight over the past year and i'm happy to shed some of it off.
falling asleep is an issue for me but so is waking up
also, yeah kugal, i guess it was technically a job, in fact a damn good one, but i feel like it did nothing for me in terms of developing skills i need for the normal workforce so now i'm playing catchup
i am jesus now
depression's a big dumb fuck
thats an interesting way to look at it, i havent thought of that
and also because i don't even know what kind of person i like
i don't have that desire
you are definitely not wrong though.  i wouldn't shy away from opportunities though.  failing at relationships is a good way to learn
and i don't want to be foolish and jump into something that's doomed to fail just because i feel lonely.
i value other perspectives.
because i still feel like i acted wrongly, even if i just didn't have the right information to act
but i think when i got with collette, the mistake there was just not really thinking about what i needed out of a relationship
i like how you evaluate the consequences of waiting and not waiting, becuase that could be the very difference in making a final decision
as long as i like them for them im happy
i also know what i like
yea i've always been in the mindset of it's better to wait, any attempt to wait to become older to fully commit in a relationship take that opportunity
how dare the human race evolve in a way that promotes reproduction and the survival of the species.
screw you biology
or just is too screwy for my tastes.
4 hours away was tolerable, but that is definitely my limit moving forward.
im gonna brb, i should get ready to leave here for the bloody final
nah, i really am just looking to talk to people
ah yes, that's kinda important
i feel better though, these conversations have been helping me not hate life.
if only walkthroughs for relationships existed, and ones that actually eorked amirite <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i think that‚Äôs all we can do
life requires and ungodly anount of patience
if you even know what your vision is
i don't have it down to a science, but as the years pass, i get better and better at knowing myself
honestly wouldn‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs highly dependent on the person
woah that's an essay to catch up on
yeah, and that's the struggle, everything is highly dependent on the person.  and i'm too trusting of an individual and i worry how much that can get me in trouble.  =\
which brings me back to, where's my damn life cheat codes at
except the dragonborn is life and you're alduin
she's definitely too good for me and she knows it
i mean, i'm honestly not opposed to mixing things up
if you don't start i'm gonna scan out every page of the drivers ed book i have somewhere and randomly send you pages
may have to
10k subs?
eyan can just go chill there
housing costs probably wouldn't matter, my aunt would be happy to provide living space
i can't stand 20 minutes worth of traffic let alone hours worth, lol
but for the record, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm too good for anyone. quite the opposite
im back
empty streets are an odd sight
yeah, arrogance
i mean, in all actuality, i have some confidence when i'm not depressed as hell
first
kinda funny though, i really don't put too much stock in appearance
that would burn through healthy mental states like a forest fire through california
well actually i usually just ask 9k to do them for me
i can't have too much summer and spring though, allergies are just too rough on me.  fall and winter offer me that reprieve
not the most appropriate timing there
sadly though i couldn‚Äôt live in any other state. california has pretty much got all that i need
i think so. it‚Äôs there enough for me to remember
or something like that
it offers me a place of peace
i prefer to look out upon the world and see death and desolation
and i'd say i'm not exactly a road rager, but bad driving is probably my biggest pet peeve
there‚Äôs always full streets of parked cars here
and then i will get one
and probably die
that was pretty nice
there is dragons, just, imaginary, lol
so is life
death is highly overrated
that's nice sweety, whatever helps you sleep at night dragonite, lol
eyan, i‚Äôm sure you have a better chance than me in my area üòõ
its ok dragonite
dragonite, that wasn‚Äôt a dream. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
ew...
on the topic of warm temperatures
nothing is nicer than weather in the comfortable 50s on a nice autumn day
147 is borderline death are you mad
that is pretty nice
i don't know you well bella, but you seem like a good person.  i don't think the arrogance that rainy is displaying is appropriate, but i think you can feel good about yourself
you get that a, wouldn't want anyone getting d around here
ida your country is already skyrim
sadly, i always have a nagging feeling to be productive so it feels like a waste of time
hey be nice to sheogarth
it feels the most fleshed out and most like home
it's cursed
and the endless power struggles
wasnt that riverwood though
hey nazeem is great
any female* single
is there a good mod that lets you be a bard?
i never used one but i know there was one bard mod that was pretty popular
no *thoughtcrime* is death
and usually anything that popular was at least good if it was what you were looking for
huh, darn i would've been good for music lol
exactly
welcome!
i'll have you know
haha good one master
that it is, thanks flubs
i'm surprised you didn't question how full of shit i am right now, lol
is he wrong though?
he now has nail polish
worst bot 0/10
it's assumed 8 unless he says otherwise
what master said
either way pings will fly when it starts
oh crap then i'll be sleeping, oh well
well apparently it's like 8 degrees out today
no reverse cards not uno cards
wow how specific
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
hey i have a life
i have the sudden urge to punch something <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
well, i have just reached my state of boredom that i go through every year before christmas; all i can think about is the new games i will play afterwards and nothing i have now can keep me entertained
no happiness allowed
unless youre going after every single medal there's literally no reason to do that when there are so many other things to do in the game
your small people are so hard to understand
let people ruin their lives in peace
i actually can't wait for the return.
why you cant go to college and also be successful? i mean you can but i dont see why youd put yourself at a four year, hundred thousand dollar disadvantage
yea..
nice
just wow
master that is how you remove yourself from the gene pool
just the usual
this shit needs the right setup
i cant get text to zoom in in my video editor even though ive specifically selected the option designated to do so, is this some weird windows shenanigans
but also, same. sadly
~~who?~~
really, i thought that was michael scott in a costume
i have literally gotten four mesa chassis in a row.
i'm michael stevens
oh, there it is
death doesnt discriminate *snap*
between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes
dont it though i mean if you got money you can get one of those cool hand freezing anti-death machines
screw you
maybe i removed it when i fixed the thing with the censor list not working
<:gwqlabsthonkery:398950779769061376>
~~80 is the best~~
yeah the censor list doesnt work
and ive heard good things about those pocket monster games
holy shit
flubs you're a wonderful person who's going to live a long and happy life
ok but why would you even use a different one
i feel like you do
text or call your grandma
huh.
oh, who am i kidding, of course you don‚Äôt
given that outoftouchtube is owned by google
to obad im already 2200 messages behind for that
done
now the only thing i send outbound email for is calling my sister dumb names
how were you not already using gmail
afterward it goes back to normal style
yeah
the end product is the same and it lowers costs
cows are food
cows that exercise taste better btw
or at least doesnt have the time for it
the entire discussion doesn't have to happen at once, albeit it is nice when its like that
well you can ask him about it when hes available and brew your thoughts together until then
history shows it wont and ill be stuck failing to understand why things are the way they are. which is really annoying
you want to keep talking about this?
id prefer to but if it makes you uncomfortable and thats grounds to stop talking for you we dont have to
milk, from it dairy products. cheese. cheese is necessary for garlic bread
mcdonalds doesnt really care if their meat tastes a little worse
it should probably care if the meat gets contaminated and they have to recall and check large samples for disease
what'd i miss
is all cow meat cooked well enough to be sterile?
who decides that's a good idea though sharing blood is the source of like half the non-malaria diseases in the history of forever
c stick one
i have absolutely no idea
wait a minute how long has my name looked like this
the thing only became a major issue in 1986 so if we take this as a sign that we can start doing questionable thigns again the problem has the potential to relapse
seamus
but probably no because theres no way this is gonna become a problem in my lifetime
but we've got time
wooo finished homework
do i want to go in for my last final or just sleep
maybe if i tell my teacher i came down with a case of death he'll let me re-take it at a normal hour
what the hell
also surprisingly doing ok despite getting up before 4:30 today
actually it doesnt but thats still an awful lot
how low do you want price
brad is this what you do for fun
mood.
then it'd kill me though
and my stomach doesnt hurt as much either
well i know that 8.2/40 is around 20% prolly closer to 21% so you couldntve done 5 times better but definitely did more than 4.75
very good intuition
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
dragonite why does a highway need to own islands?
3:30-9:30
thank you
want the audiobook?
i mean it didnt say when
thankfully i have time now to read again
i think my transcripts get updated tomorrow
you‚Äôre definitely thinking about it a lot then
kugal dont mock me >:(
0.0 stephen is doing a weird thing with the ending song atm on stream
there
yeah thats like a .0000094%
good job kugals
i cant engrish despite passing engrish final
you get
thanks pal
my final english grade is 98.2% lol
the midterm was like 90% multiple choice with just one short response  it should have been graded by the computer
how many people are in your class?
quesadilla burgers are great
same honestly
wow a new person
thanks <:pogchamp:305560024443518986>
not everyone does that
my weapon is bad memes
i think it's the steel typing
hey remember in like fourth and fifth grade when we'd get like five things for homework and the teacher would have all of it graded by like the next morning
it turned a samsung galaxy into a grenade.
that sucks
and whatever other fucking shit that counts as a character
skarm is god
he did it
the newer thief from 2016 or whatever is garbage dont play it
i feel a growing sense of dread
well people only get a little bit of god each
i think theres one in the house in solitude that starts the whole thing
those books have an interesting property to them in regards to damned souls, bella
brb gonna go talk to her
i didn‚Äôt say it would be good
tmw your robot has friends and you don't
why madagascar?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh right
but i didn't
lol if you want to
hmm it's 10:30 and ive gotten nothing done i brb
boobs are more fucking sensitive than me the morning after an alcohol bender
that's ok
i guess that may be the benefit of college
just turn it into a snowflake with editing magic
master these are your people or something
i wasnt on the ssformus
which equally is not a benefit at all
dragonite42 :::)))))
forummotion forums
did someone say forums
oooooooo
i'm the vb2 dragonite
interesting
doubt anyone remembers blackrayquaza except the few that knew
the answer is why.
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
i did this
just gotta use a bit of algebra slight of hand and u substitution and bam its super doable
initially i thought u = x¬≤ + 2x + 1 but nah
no matter how well i do on the final in one of my classes my grade will go down
i'm close to a level up so that's mainly why i'm here lol
do i continue skyrim even though i‚Äôve played a lot today o
yeah that would take a while then
is that wrong
at my school it was a 65 or below was failing and you only could go on to the next class in a series if you got at least a 73
no swearing.
backup brains, i burned through 3 of them in my theory final yesterday
this is a problem
no wonder you're so dumb. i mean what? who said tha
it would seem that way
i'm down to my last brain, if that one explodes then, well i'm shutting down until my next brain get's fixed
doesn't necessarily mean he's mechanical. and someone in the fandom most likely has written biography reports on steel type pokemon
yeeeaaaaaahhhhhhh
lots of new people
one more level and i get to be a red
a reder red lol
but mr stabby is a snowman
let's burn it
hey, i can only afford 7 brains alright
and december at that
same thing
you said yeah first which makes the no invalid
exactly, what i said
tomorrow can't be easter because easter falls on a sunday
then i'll throw a triangle
kinda lame, i wanted the car alarm to go off
both
you mean you've never seen a car growing on a tree?
more like natural farts amirite
dont eat discs thats unhealthy
yeah i thought skull kid would be one of the newcomers
i wouldn't be angry obviously, just don't care
everyone else that has a chance is just i don't care really
i also kind of have everyone that i want in smash already
dovahkiin, doomguy (just for the music), crono (watched eyan lp his game so many times), crash (i played 1 game being nitro kart), 8th gen pokemon
same, that's really why i don't feel the need to buy any dlc
and it was
yeah square is really stingy
watch as the dlc pack for crono only has 1 song in it if he's a character lol
i'm more inclined to play ff6 than 7
yeah i really don't understand why square is being so stingy with their ip
yeah and still only 2 songs
also i think geno might be dead now
yeah sora really had no chance to me at all
i'd love to see banjo in the game, but i'm not holding hope for it even with microsoft being all for the idea
yeah, so no geno, no noctis, sora's completely out of the picture because of the other company that co-owns kingdom hearts
and universal is owned by comcast iirc which is a competitor to disney
are 3 of your first party characters?: fire emblem rep, 8th gen pokemon, and slyux
i really don't know who else they could choose
btw if you've seen that quote of reggie saying that all of the dlc characters will be from franchises that are new to smash
and well
so yeah <:coerip:508432005038342174> that character
that's a given...
i have my expectations low here
there's also the fact that they would not add an echo unless it's a two-for-one deal, and each will give us only one fighter
i'd say it was that he was announced as the first dlc of the fighter packs, even at such a big event no less
instead of banjo & kazooie <:lul:305559915714576385>
it honestly annoys me even as someone who has never played their games
though metal gear rising would make for a better point of reference because platinum games
i got a 106/100 on the final in that last class and my final grade _still_ went down
dovahkiin or doomguy
for some reason, the 21st always had weird sentimental value to me for absolutely no real reason but i forgot about it this year
so only 1 more 3rd party then?
it makes sense actually. i think i‚Äôm the same way, but i had an earlier birthday than i was supposed to but i don‚Äôt know the date of that
one day i‚Äôll find my birthday twin
paving your own path is the dream
*plays the ‚Äúi hate people‚Äù song from spongebob* this should be my theme song
as it turns out, i'm going to be spending most of today applying for my first ever job.
lets not
you can catapult yourself ahead a lot faster if you get a good one
everyone did
i have pirouettes which are a close 2nd
or at least well enough to enjoy venting his frustrations on fictional characters by brutally murdering them?
you tell me, you're the one who answered the question
either way, they need to work as well to get their pay
an ethically questionable career
must be an important job just sitting in one place
i see that, it's okay though, i won't ignore your ass
i imagine that line will now go in the bot also, lol
hai friends ^w^
greetings, will.
oh joy, apps are always unnescessarily long
nice
nice ^w^
nice
i'm not even going to ask questions in risk of getting snapped to dust
e!google ask reddit hangover tips
but still, i just didnt get any joy from it.
r34lol is great but has become infested with kda
i think it's supposed to be a glass of water per drink
they'll get over it
most people forgot about the meteos situation within two weeks, so it kinda is
ohh....
i frequently forget rall exists
k pop.
i dont understand, why are there people that find underage anime girls attractive?
do you exercise regularly?
i mean, i'm not fine, but i'll be fine, i think
cuz even small things like going for a run can help combat feeling depressed and down,
i better, lol
i think i have an unhealthy obsession with this overcoat
neither am i
i love when this bot is accurate to the conversation
i‚Äôve had three coffees this week. am i a stereotypical adult yet
close enough
i really want a water bottle but have been too lazy to buy one
i also forgot where my box was so i lost my debit card as well
and i have a soda machine in our lunch room but i've been cutting back
and that's it
anyways food is here peace
actually, good
nice
i don't even know what that is so i'm good
just dont get a degree and you can do that
what is wrong with me
it's an internship position.
it's a floating island how hard can it me
today's was about cats
tis that cold time of the year
no theyre still doing stuff for the community, but this is like a giant wooden spike in your side that puts all else on the sidelines
ahhh
and it's stressful
id say theres the effective solution of making all claimed content private but theres too many alternative uploads available
eh, true
why didnt you just attend them when they were live
that would be somethin' else
oh dear, we lost him
greetings, animal\_man\_.
just let a bot meme
ive never understood that expression. like i get you *can* kick yourself but why. it doesnt even hurt
very weird in fact
the angles of it make it tough
well you can be alive on the outside and dead on the inside
live a little
have fun with stream folks
he prophecized this moment
cheese
made for an art challenge on another discord server

she's just going to recite the entire library of babel
i do want to do that
what are the main memes of 2018
honestly yeah
oh that
you got that pretty spot on
otherwise
i'm not eating there
i've never been so complimented and intrigued at once
i'm just depression drinking to ignore the fact i'm spending christmas entirely alone
in statistics you always round to the even number
just time
i've played maybe an hour
i don't have time i just make it by putting off things that are actually important
is nobody going to point out the fact that i've had gms open for like 9 days straight because ive been too lazy to click the little x button
cool
but cool

based on the context, you

<:ironic:307345212328509442>
the rest being days off from work, partying with your friends, and watching gladiatorial events
saturnalia was like 40% gift exchanging
merry christmas eve, ya nerds
you mean they played football on christmas in those days?
magfest is a 3.5 day event so on any given day there's a 1% chance that i'll be at magfest
of course you did
everyone is dragonite
music and gaming festival

italians do the big song and dance on the 24th
good luck don't die
it's the main day in some countries
you guys will be here all day tomorrow and i will probably be with family almost all day, except for the hour or two after opening presents in which i play my new video game(s)
ironically missed the ping because i was playing sims 3
all driving speeds will be in m/s
and go to church and apologize on the 25th
i like how the modern internet just lets you google strings of six words and instantly find out who said them
nice
yummy
it's a sheogorath quote
i'm pretty sure we lose like four one-millionths of a second per year or something
its the one people want the most of
the clone wars
then one day the charge port just decided to lose all grip on any charger plug
tonight has been downgraded from "awful" to "armageddon"
i once dropped mine flat face first onto concrete. was not pretty
so today i was playing my drums, with my phone bluetooth connected to my headphones and then when i decided to stop playing i dropped the phone onto a drum, and it landed onto one of th tension rods in the worst possible way ever
that is, if you play the drums
but thats not the point
come to think of it, i actually need to get a phone at some point in the near future
that‚Äôs the exact lyrics where i thought it‚Äôd go bad, actually
like one day the charger port just decided to lose any and all grip
i asked for a new phone for christmas. hopefully, i get it tomorrow
present spoiler
point b
the train station most likely
something something westbound train 70 mph something something eastbound 10 mph faster something something when will they meet
that
no the answer is boston because one train breaks down
congrats don't get too litty now
i can't talk
mine may have a second one, but with the only angle i'm viewing it from, it'd be impossible to see
sheogarth - guru of madness

<:gwnonexmaikasmug:402867199825674251>
well yes
why does mute not fucking work on the bot
it‚Äôs still only christmas #1 tho
merry christmas
sleep is in picoseconds, the rest are hour:minute
so my average day for the past year consists of 7:51 of sleep, 3:20 warframe, 2:39 school, 1:40 with eyan, 1:36 with family, 0:57 on homework, 0:37 in the car, 0:36 on reddit, and everything else is bellow half an hour so its inaccurate
hmmm sleep what a good idea
but i dont remember any dreams
happy christmas exclusively to those who dont celebrate
christmas merry
how loosely?
theres a second one?
id join and sing but my throat is missing
i might pop into the stream later when my family is not here and i actually have peace and quiet

panic mode activate
look
ruined the grading curve
i win???
deja vu
rise up
i can deal with this
duel me
i can rap guns and ships
you got this
they don‚Äôt reach a peace, that‚Äôs alright
time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
you have him turn around so he can have deniability
you pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
oh god
it was amazing
honestly, i'm stupid proud of that timing
awww
hmmmm
oops?
that's me falling out of my chair
how can men be so fucking dense
like what the fuck
at any given chance
are you calling eyan stupid
sorry.
did rainy just get cursed
there's aplan?
it's a mess
if eyan had infinite density shouldn't we all be accelerating towards pittsburgh at infinite speed
mucho mejor
yes danit
depends on starting location and end destination
nooooo
oh my
what
buy me a pretty skin
answer the question bird
fuck you
did i say an expensive skin?
i'm in school, so that's where it's spent
so like
not rn
panda can‚Äôt math
i‚Äôll try to. i haven‚Äôt played in a while
eyan, go to mag with me, i'll cosplay star guardian ahri
yang, one star guardian. and stevonnie
weird, me too
tsa broke a $400 prop
i did
eyan
nevermind
we can‚Äôt hear you. at least i can‚Äôt
all of my attraction
hear who
aqua
i loved kaisa at first
but we saw her first
shes right
ehhh
oh im stupid
no hetero
oh noes d:
i'm just drunk
go to hell, robot
it's one of those big neckhole ones
wait get one for me while you're at it
i paid and played
thanks! hope you all have a good day
no thanks lol
you're just noticing?
how do you think i'm getting that cosplay bod
eyan
nerds
you know you love it, babe
considering i dn't die of hangove
reminds me of infintie hover in jak 2/3
panada. do i have you on steam
what??
no clue how it works tho so rip lol
wow, eyan just called me cute
we killed him
me and my sister were playing smash this morning, on the gamer stage
i wasn't here when that happened
also she's your age, i'll introduce you, she also loves gamers rise up and prequel memes and warframe and is about your age
holy fuck
awww
anytime
supposedly i havent joined the steam group before now lol
honestly, 9k has filled much better role of god than any christain god has
its the 25th for another 2 hours lol
did you just assume the size of my skull
oh come on youre supposed to assume the size of the other head
how dare you assume assumptions
what is sleep
fuck
you always do, babe
dumb
heed
scream
you like drunk me?
did you see that density chart
it's okay, deceit is prerequisite to fun oft times
he's dumb
night guys ^w^
i'm always questioning
nighty
try me then
men are so easy
and also to god
it's slightly sad
if the next song makes my ears bleed after this
so not like he'll consider not saying yeas to anything for a second
considering the amount of alcohol
can you screencap mine and eyan's duel? it's very important
master got sent to the gallows
i think she wants to blow me or something, unfortunately, i'm more dense than a black hole so i'm not really sure
oh everyone's gone
i probably will soon enjoy, i fucking love hiking
haven't gone on any this month, probably a good idea to go burn off the like 4000 calories of booze anythe 300 calories of christmas dinner
when did rainy become a monarch?
beat him up
why do you say that? did you steal $11 from me?
i got an electric blanket for christmas and it has helped wonderfully to alleviate cold
i am a cheap date for real, i look for the chicken on the menu and order like the cheapest thing, if not a salad
7% but i'll ignore it on rainy's behalf
it's always safe to take me to a steakhouse, i hate red meat
lol, i know i'm weird
you seemed to be quite interested at one point in time
sure
gimme a sec, i gotta get back in character
also eww
you're right
it's okay, i am too
i mean, you could be like rainy, she's interesting, but it cost her her soul
being that awesome doesn't come free
i mean, people in general arent very interesting. they dont have character arcs to follow and no cool powers. they just complain and use resources until they roll over and die
i never had a soul to being with
1:55 am] queen alexis hamilton: 9k was just showing me his pussy (underappreciated and underused joke)
please don't, lol
we break that rule pretty often
oh no, i know exactly why
i mean
oh, so we're role playing now
enlighten me, why?
it's such a bother to have to keep turning all caps on and off
because you are innocent
my response to it is "yeah, you like that you fucking retard"
fair enough
rainy said this [2:01 pm] thy queen, zealots: you can just yelll at me, i'm into it
r/askreddit i assume?
there was some story on reddit about things people accidentally said during sex and that story blew up and went full scale meme
same, they feel like a waste of time
they're really nice people, its just a very non structured job
my schedule is "come in the next time im told to come in and saturdays"
they probably won't, just saying, that's the kind of thing where all it takes is that one asshole to screw it all up
kinda like how i could park out front our hotel until somebody got caught and then there was a massive crackdown on it
on the bright side, at least it's a little exercise
i don't call him that, master is a... reserved term for me
where'd my queen go?
<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
i was wondering who you were referring to
thank you my queen
i have a very stupid question i need to ask
so just as a warning, dont get mad if it is very stupid
don't worry, i can definitely get more mad
yeah, for once i agree with eyan
so should i not ask it
are eyan and rainy dating?
no, please do
all of em
all of them more enjoyable than the last
you'd have to be some eyan levels of dense
gonna need you to explain that one to me
she just likes fucking with me
go to hell robot
<:gwqlabsgarthink:407619157044232192>
that'd be giving too much credit
does it ever not?
that's not how being dense works
no, we'd be dead because you would have somehow managed to unleash a virus on everyone in the server
i'm also surprised
unless it's to x person/people who shan't be named
this day is draggin
also you only got what, 2 hours left
normally it's like 40-50 minutes depending on how fucked i get, but it should be 30 tops today
unfortunately
what a tragedy
perfect isn't easy
look
and rome wasn't built in a day, i know all too well that looking beautiful takes time
i blame rainy
that's how i felt yesterday, but i think that's just called  a hangover
i had to call you a dumb fuck three times
new year's isn't until next week
new year new me
i'm capable of trying
pfft, that's up to your discretion
that was a fun read
just gotta gimme the word to release it
obviously
but we can't test that theory
of a useless goddess?
an aqua cosplay would be remarkably easy
e!google glass of water
materials for everything else: <$80
yeah that sounds about right
rainy only shared one of the two cat pics
<:rookb:399827497786540032> ?
so do i, i built a youtube channel off of it
what's the least ajit part of florida?
take them to the house resi7 was based on
well a bog house where two barely human bodies were found and never identified
who's being dense now
don't ruin my fantasy eyan
should we document dragonite as an scp
i'm gay now
welp
wait
so we stopped giving a shit
just saying
if you must specify a playable race, probably balgruuf the greater
who is the hottest male character in skyrim?
yeah that
too much stress
i can make any cosplay for any body, given enough... experience with said body
no the one that gets you in and consults you in the storyline but then doesn't do much after
along with a picture for reference
you won't stop me from handling you sexually? wow, truly a scholar and gentleman
why would i not be?
there are quite a lot of medical students though
picky, are we?
good job (‡πë‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)b
hmmm
charge extra per hour for each incompetent client
people like complaining more than money duh
nice
technically i'm referring to my ap system, not windows
we have children?
hmmm
i didn't even know we were dating let alone that far into things
i get the pc
i get his cat
i miss a lot when i‚Äôm busy working and not being here ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
"rainy - guru & queen of ass"  something like that?
(dont worry the hard drives will be incinerated)
i ain't eyan's s tuff
a-sofs
but i dont know if i could handle that responsibility
highly effective
oh look, rainy is finally understanding how i became more dense than a black hole
me right now
well, it's up to her, lol
what were your expectations?
you're good at drawing a bunch of scribbles and pretending they're instructions
are you?
i wanted to go to prom, but
alcohol will do that to you
alcohol?
same
ill get the flamethrowers
a lot of people look back at high school with at least *some* degree of fondness
but i wanna dance
eyan you just need to learn how to optimize your talents, is all
black 2 and white 2 came out
oh wait that's for the smoking campaign
i didn't choose anything last night
thank you for that
that was worth it
alakazam can eat whatever he wants with his spoons
plot twist, i was gay all along
except double plot twist, not really
fuck all that
eyan
now see what you did
fair enough
and thus rainy cried
btw, 9k, set our permissions for the voice channels to include anything prehistoric frog and above
no idea what you're talking about but okay
hmm?
i never would have guessed from the name
what's with you and baconators?
correct
imagine being assassinated by someone who uses a knife and fork for their pizza
that's who
uhh last night probably
were i anywhere remotely in the vicinity, we'd have already had multiple let's go dates
steam apparently understands me
it recommended a game called boobs saga
so it was _you_ who sent me the free trial of playboy magazine?
you'll notice i said "mostly"
it's not your fault
you dont have to give us an exact number, just the data type that would be required to store them
probably
i'm sorry
huh, maybe i don't have you beat then, technically i only have 3 but i had a fourth that was close
cause if we're going with one date, then, uhhh... lol
i doubt she remembers half the names
and i can just go back though my google account that i use for tindr contacts
i'm here to shine bright and bring everyone else down with me
yeah but with even more ways to start an explosion
like all over the damn place
i sort of always imagined rainy is the personification of a nuclear bomb
the deepest emotional connection i've had heretofore...
i'd say she needs to aim
well i'm not
how depressing do i wanna get with this?
zero
oh yes
i don't wanna build emotional connections with anyone
probably wise

<:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
everything
my two year+s with men permanently scarred me (one literally) and my year+ with a girl is still my friend
the heart wants to beat
the heart wants a beating
therefore brain is stupid
case in point
but on the other hand the brain gave us video games
yeah but brains also invented the lobotomy
that sounds like a problem that can be taken care of at a later point in time
another thing about men, they always see me as a problem to fix, it's so fucked
stop
nevermind, i'm just self pitying
granted i haven't looked at any of em
i type, send, and than ignore
send them to yourself?
you should send them to random foreign emails
i mean i wouldn't have put it past me to have sent a few to random people by accident
i mean
not much, you?
keep it on
play smash bros.
because you complain about being tired
but you won't go the fuck to sleep
same honestly
cause in it's time, it was fucking stupid
i'm calling you fucking stupid
not brilliant
so you're tired you say?
i see you ignoring me
you were
you're welcome
driving trip continues, i'll be there at like 1
huzzah
we stopped at some store to buy tomatoes and cucumbers
dad is being stupid with the checkout
do we just like the same shit or something rainy
clearly
oh shit
you forgot?
bring me some takis to apologize
which ones tho
i ain't picky
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
lets get it
so it works out
lmfao
more or less
<:roodab:509458870700212235>
shall i spam it
so it doesnt really matter
good shit girl
remember?
i dunno, next summer
eyan
it's refreshing
but it wouldn't be authentic
but alas
hmm, i'll move to st catharines, seems like my kind of city
i just wanna live in canada
no promises
alright, fine, i'll take the pic after i make you breakfast, if you're clothes aren't on by then you're a lazy fuck
what kinda breakfast do you prefer?
wait no
but eyan
oh right it's still not magfest
what kind of breakfast?
called it
probably not
i can make amazing coffee cake
yo wtf
can i come in the middle of it than?
you will not escape coffee
fair
or slow motion
i also love tea
tea is great
that it is
nice
we have acquired the vip, back in another 50
i'll be long gone
hear me out
bullshit
tim horton's is üëå
yo right
oh my god i am so aroused
none of them are talos
oh shit
unless it was just a jebait
okay artemis and aphrodite are actual gods so props to you for using actual gods
he's god of memes and menial tasks
uhhh
but not my god
empire loves lists
actually isaac brock
move everything else down a step
so a clean 10 now ok
that last name is neat
me or 9k?
the christians are so boring with one jackass
this one sounds like a party
no offense to any christians in here but your religion robbed me of the first 16 years of my life
well it's certainly not the heaven i want.
even thought mike is still alive
and jack daniels
that stuff is just... no
to make a molotov with?
making a molotov without vodka is heresy
wait you mean it's possible?
down the hatch it goes
i'll let you know later
so the vip we picked up is now talking about various religions to my dad
ask about the most obscure thing possible
pffft
it' s better tho
oh wait
yeah at least you learn shit from that
yeah it is better the vip is roasting dad's bad management
doesnt sound like anything new
whos the manager?
and then the vip starts screaming mother of god at an average sized deer like 50 ft away from the road
who is the mother of god
the not-so-virgin-rainy
the anti-virgin
wait panda is?
power of what?
oh hiya flubs
rainy have you tried a preschool that doesn't have catholic influence?
he wants anything
please
my ego
if you make that graph
i will add on another dirnk to what i owe you
blueberry
pancakes/breakfast in general
chocolate chip
and cinnamon
well still
flubs
such a sucker for food?
anywhere
megumin, put her close to but below me
also hi friends lol ^w^
hiya will
i need a negative
oh right
that scale tho lol
thanks deci and panda for setting the curve
i am aroused
i just cover my calzones in sauce and eat with fork and knife
i work in a hispanic restaurant
rough translation
how often do i go outside
ok rain
can you fill this out
precesely
i love quickshot
i'm just going through discord look for things i called god at any point
it's a metroidvania hack n slash
and the 100%+ percent come from things outside of the game universe
mithrarin's augment?
fidget killed god
this is fidget, she killed god
that's the only material i know on top of my head cause it sounds like weed
i'm so proud of you
my favourite thing about that game is that fidget makes a resi4 reference
i believe so
rude
thats less than not productive
hell yeah
but i keep sitting in discord and staring into space
skyrim?
it's the goddamned skyrim engine
time is math
i'm into it
time off means memory decay
it has a purpose
integral of y dx
no +c no degree
should be fired
why did he design malaria
just integrated one of the craziest functions, got this as the answer lul
and i can‚Äôt fall back asleep because i‚Äôm hungry
#blamerainy
i‚Äôm just glad i have today off. but i probably won‚Äôt be able to take a nap for a little while
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
surprisingly tricky compared to vector editing.
i'm much more at home in inkscape than gimp, but i'm learning, i think.
i figured the end of the year would suck for this job, but god does it suck
uh ok then
oh, so we want to debate semantics of what is possible vs what is justified?
because
as soon as you hopped back in voice
and i told you to go the fuck to sleep
pardon me, i am as dense as the entire universe packed into a tiny spec of spacetime right before the big bang
that's deep
that's another large point in the "pros" column
i wish it was time for lunch
just pack your own lunch if you don‚Äôt want it
why? i don‚Äôt know. everyone is crazy, i guess
fuck off mee6
oops all caps
also hi ida, i played your gift on stream last night
(i've gotta find the vods for that)
i love the genre though so i'll never not like metroidvania
the number one reason i want smash is to play castlevania, lol
the number one reason i want smash is because smash
he'd be way too op
yeah, and?
i'm just depressed
when that shit comes around i'll have to settle for not actual nerds cause all the actual nerds will be fucking their computers
i mean, you really don't
ooh, yummy.
i mean, milk chocolate is fine if it's what you desire
dark chocolate is where it's at
wow 9k, i've never seen someone on here have such a correct opionion
you're wrong on the grounds that you annoy me
dark chocolate reflects the bitter, stygian nature of my soul. i have a connection to it that spans the eons
he's just dumb, he doesn't know what he's saying
i've got a plug in belgium that frequently sends me belgian, german, and swiss chocolates
also, who the fuck spends 1609.58 on a 100 napkins
get out of here with your bitch ass dinky ass toilet paper ass napkins
i need a nap
we shall rest when we are dead
sure
this kingdom doesn't actually have rules against any type of death
you see the trick is to do that before you leave the shower
try harder
~~they love each other~~
this is too lewd
how's saturday at 6 sound?
not you ida
my place
i mean, you're invited if you want ida
you want her to give you a not dumb reason?
real life is dragging me out of my coffin
at one point? did it ever stop?
imma take an aside to say i have a great butt.
i just had the anime scenario of trying desperately to get my new jeans over my butt
hope you stole more than a check if you're planning to share
code breaking for lockpicking. avoiding security cameras for sneak. bows disabled for archery.
unlike rainy
that's cause you're stupid
i have several chapters of gov notes to take care of before that which i haven't started on either
and the reading is a nice one that i usually have to cram into a few hours so this will be a nice change of pace if done right
sounds like it‚Äôs doable at least
eyan
mmmmm
listen here you little shit
quadruple doesn‚Äôt seem like enough
eyan what's the integral of 3dx
i mean, i got a b
but in high school, that was failing for me
high school was hell for me
oof no reminders about gpa
but i had just over 1500 on sat and 34 on act
so applying for schools is fun
not really, i didn't try that hard, lol
took one, did fuckall on the english and essay portions, somehow got 1440
but i don‚Äôt remember much of any spanish
i did ib but i was kicked out at the very end for uhhh... reasons
~~did you get drunk?~~
my condolences rc
english however, required 4 credits. so, you had to take one every year
1 which counted as 2 in 12th you mean macro econ?
hope so
why would i though?
eyan
mmk, that's acceptable
actually, maybe not, we're almost sold out
lemme check on actual flights
yeah, dia
kinky
9k, look those up for me
3 monitors
that should answer all questions
nullpointerexception: soul reference
i have no siblings, but i look forward to fucking with my cousins in the same way
my restaurant already has a well designed site, unfortunately
oh yeah that works
that's
i plan to replace the 16:9 after this next semester
someday when i have free time again
but the pixel count
the blonde's outfit on my desktop is one of the cosplays i have now
it's in the show
they have icons
dumb people
cause i feel like that should be prerequisite to meeting me
for like, everyone
hey 9k, you dabble in avengers memes, right?
any chance you could get me the thor "does he...?" meme
oh wait no, it's is he
that one?
i see you're on the winning side
if the rapture happened would it resemble the snap?
maybe
even the bot hates me
i expect nothing less
>implying you cant bend the meaning of language to be appropriate with ever message
he does proc the censor on edits thought
curiosity expands the known data set to expand a search for potential patterns which can in the long term simplify the work necessary to get a desired answer
the macro scope of that is logical. if you have enough people in your society, surely some of them can take risks and venture out into the unknown. the society can survive the loss and may get an even greater reward for it
how many people sailed out into the unknown and were never heard from again before one managed to find a new land?
yeah, we're all just sentient links in a very long chain of evolution. the way we sway will have an impact on the future for others
neither does living another 10 years
sure it does
sure having them around is great for then and there but that impact is limited. if that group does manage to find somethi- this is the part where i realize i have no idea where i'm going with this
something about elon musk wanting to have other companies put him out of business
being curious is an emotion, emotion is illogical
are we planning on re-implementing the naughty words censor or something
actually it doesnt
that's a topic for down the road
also master im disappointed you did not save fus go fuck yourself
fair enough
what is a man
hmmm
in a good way or a bad way
all right that's it
curiosity creates long term gains at the price of potential short term losses if you're not careful
you seem to oversimplify it
doesnt automatically invalidate them all
it would make decisions based purely on logic
or do turtles eat turtles
eyan isnt it past your bedtime
also, my bedtime is when i want it to be
that's what curiosity gets you
wait that happened?
if you ever think you did something stupid, just remember, at some point in human history someone decided to squeeze a cow's udders to see what happened _and it caught on_
and are they still alive
do you have any data on how often questions in this server actually end with question marks
considering the one you just asked doesnt
what is a man
when is it not?
that looks broken
so one to one reply to valid conditions should be fine
some people are into that
jesus is into drinking blood
you mean tomato juice right
it's symbolic ya ninny
>for 10 million, i think my wife would be there cheering me on.

mages can cast beneficial spells on others, does that make them gods?
most of the time

this is a good one to start with
i'll be home in 20 and beat all y'all's asses
