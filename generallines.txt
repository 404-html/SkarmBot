wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
that means you swung to attack.
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
fine fine
it was, ida.
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
it changed my keys
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
just a reminder that 3 diamonds are needed for the storage heart.
currently -23 here
gummy i will destroy you if i have to

if you buy it for a year you get two months free
wait wtf

okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
yes ida
oh no i didnt mean the food
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
now i want pizza...
fine but if i go to bed before then i expect you to be honest
make games
flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night
i don’t even know what that is
benny has won a total of $10,000 so far
i can't tell who raised the hand on mobile
that’s the word
the p stands for "public", silly goose
christ, and it takes like an hour to launch, too
perfect ida
heh heh you see what i did there?
breaking dirt
got battlefront 2
have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
i have one pencil tho
eating it
i dont really care what quality its in
i could tell they were being flirty also
good
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.
those are the best easymode wings you can get your hands on with thorium

minus ore seeds.
if you know you definitely took everything, try to think about other things
nah i don't feel like keeping track
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
we died so many times to it

i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
previous mistakes were repeated
because she did the forcing/blackmail
oh trench warfare is wasy to understand
peter the great
i can't at this point master
the sad part is, the businessmen back home were profiting from all this
it was probably the fries that gave you away
also, did you try fighting skeletron already?
if i wasn't, we wouldn't have been able to beat the bosses.
i don't know.
although i just lost connection
e!says-add i don't know what to do, its working!
-spirit
-calamity
ah yes, the bees.
krelian, please. ^_^;
it's fine, wolve.
not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
i'm kicking overhaul out for the next server
forget it ida
it used up every single free bit of space on my drive
taking a break from playing 2 hours of blazblue.
oh fuck
not even close.
i can imagine the banner having stickfigures in it now
like the soc.
canterlot equestria
i'll tell you about flubs pm
speaking of playing, we just beat plantera in our game
you have a biased sample
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
it’s not
not that, you ninny.
it's follow
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
heartgold and soulsilver
just walk away slowly, animal man.

the paul brothers are loud. you want more of them?
cuz y'know
they just subbed to me and followed me on twitter
i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
fear
and who cares if it’s fictional
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
~~ill have fun hehe~~
i already explained it to like idk
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
money chest
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
the hallowed megaphone
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
ho-oh
idk never played it either lol
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
its gotta be true
a rarity plushie and a tricorne/bicorne hate
henlo wolve
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
do not participate in the life ruining juice
i thought panda meant me for a sec lol
rarity pkushie made in the uk
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
i think that's calamity
everyone said it

when you least expect it
physics is evil
just stand there while everyone dances
im bored
no, it is literally the opposite
honestly knowing me since i can’t fit a mlp song actually i might but i am leaning towards a military song
you know rainy is right flubs
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
platinum was the last game to have it
at least she thinks im lovely
i reversed your message
we all did
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
gummy its totally bc its you
ahem ahem *cough* enlightened ahem *cough*
coffee drinker
even the decent ones are just not realistic
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
it just might overhaul though.
its in
that's the smell of nature, you fool
how'd you even get it?
they charge money for use of the mods content.
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
that's a good idea.
so if i had to guess
save the portal for next time
currently alone in a very empty quiet hallway
nothing happen to me
college
2 was meh
ehh effort
yes rc go ahead with the snarky
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
more than you
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
yeah me trying to pogo myself onto my desk using one hand
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?
it's not a kingcorphish repeat
seriously my cabinets have chips and other snacks, my drawers have cookies and other desserts, and my shelves have high quality spices
idk why my classmates made a big deal about it
so asshole was an asshole, huh?
i have like 0 friends irl and im 100% ok with it because irl people are weird

this clip is a very low standard for both faith and a very high standard for humanity

i really question the use of math sometimes

they weren't stupid enough to not learn from their mistake tho
im 5 11 but have tiny hands and feet
my parents dont know what patreon is and that';s probably a good thing
i just wear shoes bigger than my foot
i can't stand that stuff
i was responding to stuck's last message to me
urgh, i should sleep too. but this is the first time ive gotten to write real code in a few days and i'm trying to fight the withdrawal
brb screen break

i always read "defaced" as "defacated"
or maybe it was alyssa
hey guys i have an idea
mine would be a remix of nuclear fusion.

i'm still in pre-hardmode xp
i'm not going to be held responsible for the death of the bot
it reminded me of you
damn it
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
"the funeral is at 6:00, please be on time"ypoo
too late
doesnt help me figure out who tf owns the discord beta testing server tho

yeah, we do
owo this is interesting
great now i have self-confidence issues
"genious"
did i miss something
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
but when you type `main` in with a capital m you need to manually input {} later on for your code to run
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
you need a 3ds and money
you have a lot of liquid nitrogen
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
i dont want those nsfw ones tho
i don't want there to be too much lag
can't too tired
how about that weather?!
eew gross why do you have poewrpoint and onenote pinned
and that's just one item.
fibus lusec wecos vinosec
i needed that after dinner snack
in a holy shit my mouth is burning but i'm also hungry kind of way
and while they use modern guns they actually wear colour uniforms
thats that to none
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
thats how you are supposed to upload now on twitch i gues
now it's a force schedule your video
how many views
this is the kingdom of zeal
everything?
so i don't have to do that ^^^
even with a job
you already do, ninny
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
good
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
you are not joining
it's not this video is a test run master
you didnt change your number tag yet
probably could but this dress is expensive
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
i do
:spinning: x3
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
we already know what you're gonna pick tho
how dare somebody play my champ
~~one of us. one of us.~~
i'm afraid to join vc xp
i'm sculpting models right now, squid.
when
i wonder what other rank ups could’ve been
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
did you see the pic rc?
!rank
get the chat to fight and blow things up
i see.
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
the world doesn't revolve around you, gummy.
it is
wait thank god squid is now pink
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~
he’s going to die
remember magic wand
you killed my father
i arrive back
i love hnnngggg-ing
figured out how to make a brachistochrone in excel
that too lol
what is with all of the icons
oh hey, you're dunban now, rc?
nothing, like that
henlo shade
drago is the winner
my tradition is just not watching the game
damn misspelling...
darn
so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
what game is it?
e!bot
skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
no its a color
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
a bit of both?
dammit (follower name here)
adventurous
they let you on phones last year in spare
plus a server which is connected to the dm
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
my catchphrase is better
pot meet kettle, gummy
i never guilt trip you
did i just walk in on something here
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
it's fun
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
but drama is fuuunnnnn
or pregnant luigi
i wanted to be blue :c
goood gummy
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
the bot is taunting me
im no friend of his
never most likely
let me guess: same person?
how goes things?
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
how are you?
because flubs is more fun
um thanks rainy
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
officers!
no no lets
wow before premiere it had quality options
no one talks to him
ida what else do you thinki do that’s a waste of time?
and that too
notice the "man"
banked garlic bread from ~~scratch~~ raw ingredients
dazzling is next at school then
every kind of doughnut violently smashed into one megadonut > all alternatives
doesnt mean he cant react with them
kaiser
keyword: should
love being the hypocrite here
heh heh
brb looking up how many joules are spent in an hour long bike ride at fifteen mph
i thought it was fairly obvious :c
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
so i just made some more pure gb today
it’s been more than 15 seconds since he last said something
i’m nit picking probably haha
archive them somewhere or something
whelp.
in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
close
programmer art sound effects
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
and they want to outplay inflation in profits i think
ahh starting week count on monday
and hey you have bad apple yay
i guess i missed the part where dragonite's name was changed to 'screw you master - guru of screw'
said you were
until you quit this server?
i like the diving events too
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
huh?
you dissapoint me and i leave now
i know rc thats why nothing bad should happen
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
him and mal (his wife) do show up in the discord server quite a bit; at least one of them, once a day
yeah
<:treason:396483914803445761>
not the greatest.
no squid that’s inappropriate
and thumbs up had its own glitch
“prick”
use sylveon lol
i didn’t. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
i already promise not to have a huge freakout ever since the october 8th 2016 at 7pm incident
i have crystal and there is a reason why they made remakes
okay then
ill throw one ultra ball
why did nintendo do a poor job on vc emulation?
maybe flubs but i know how to handle most of the situation
asus
same
can i get ban so i don't have to jump back and forth to different servers?
i do plan on catching legendaries in unorthodox balls when i get to usum
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
i can wear that and shake my tail
what do you guys feel about randomizers
it just has this charm to me i don’t know
i could have done 1804 or 1815
yes it was dumb bird
what kind is it?
now it feels like the bot is being sarcastic
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
there's another good response
when i wake up its a blank slate of "~~where am i to go me johnies~~ no idea what to do today"
-31 here
oh that makes sense
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
that is ok
and i don't wanna do a sidebox
no kill me
what’s life? isn’t it a game? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
doit
we need a quarantine
true true probably when i get idk 1000 views...likes that’s going to happen lol
amazing how many costumes he can layer up
possibly
seen the escape rope fail yet?
i said me, you ninny
you know who was also a good tsar?
oops caps

namely, her.e
kk cya
wow, grade a english on my part
and now it's rubbing it in. <:lul:305559915714576385>
this is what i look like
what was i being thanked for
ask my classmates
i’m not drinking anything
and they don't know anything else
funny how a jerk friend tried to convince i really was a lady and that my brain was telling me i wasn’t
\the adventure one is sfw
well don't throw up in here
i do wish he could just chat here once in a while, but i guess he’s too busy
explanation please
frickin captain colours sounds better than that
the battle is starting soon
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
i see.
so many scottish accented voices shouting "think you can take me?" in my head right now, this is normal
someone help
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
waffles
it sucks you in, i know that from experience
no but can we talk about the non food pancakes. theyre better
that sounds stupid

not a fan of steak either
not a name i recognize
i dont even remember posting that
i wouldn't willingly order it
i mean where did you find the news?
wow i am not ban in his twitch chat
like overall student's eoc scores raised by like 7%
it is beyond my comprehension how someone doesnt like salmon roll
that good?
nice
e!dragonite-b
pay eyan $5 and that'll be a yes
you have to look really close and cross your eyes and poke yourself in the face with the arrow tip
raw fish?
i question how effective that solution is
enhanse
never thought i would see this day
over yours and corphish's dead bodies
i've always gone for water starts on my first playthroughs.
i was only 1 then
that went well
man i quit the mod job
sleep is for the weak.
well go do it then, i'm too lazy to do it
okay, because that previous message confused me
does that kill
you dying?
are you telling flubs that's the decision you made that he won't agree with
because it's not
sup nerds
it may not hep, but it helps
brb doing garlic bread cinematography
<:coolstorybob:327305348698603520>
oh...
well i get it
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
also on the subject of ports secret of mana just got a steam remake, anyone know if it's any good? (it's getting pilloried by the reviews)
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
i also like just drunk ideas in general
"hey!"
wait i havent added taht
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
good mentality
hai everyone <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
<:pcmr:305892755014418435>
that wasn't a pun
or alternatively: looking at the abyss
and that’s not green
i cant get food out of my fridge
but fallout 4 really is better
where is he?
now why would you do that
dayum
oh darn i missed a stream
again, are we dealing with the bot or gummy at this point
good
they're glitchy
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
it's been fantastic
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
honestly i kinda believe andi would do something crazy like this
~~are we eating chicken?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
but are we eating the chicken?
even talking about treason is treason
i should get it, but again...lazy
iirc
you can stop with your pickup lines now
time to ask everyone to follow me
x&y has always been hated
it's just getting better and better.
congrats
i said dragon, not dragonite
i'd pay money to ban this entire server just because i enjoy anarchy
definitely
gen ii is still my favorite.
connection issues
oh and fries get a free pass ofc
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
modulo.
i wanna get an inkay though
that's not fun
because it works
this is true
it was funny
you never talk to me
how do i hide channels again?
maybe
yup master jinx me
i am
to have something in common: to share the same interests ~~or have similar characteristics~~
that's my job

thats not something in common
mystery dungeon explorers of sky is stupid
hg/ss is so expensive. a new copy is $799
i despise it but i don’t fully hate it
well today was a horrible day
did you see godzilla blow up the mailman?
i ordered two...
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
a dog didn't explode the mailman though, a giant mutated lizard did
is it part poodle part moth <:kappa:374346980136058893>
maybe. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs
time to level up
rest well then
thank you
i kind of don't hang out here anymore
hey will
wait nvm he got caught more than once
like
sometimes it takes 2 seconds other times its like half an hour
against sivir azir rakan
hey man turn that frown upside down
i dont know how to respond
few days later and i just remembered how bad it is
oh, maybe
it sounds interesting
but double team umbreon just murders
theres nothing in the bullet
yeah thanks
though i don’t think you will give me a wand
is that the first action directed at wolverale, now
skarm does not want battle revolution
i don’t like ghestsis.
yup twitch support is on it
colress is good

<:lul:305559915714576385>
wait a second
you didn't even get the joke.
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
my code isn't working and i have no idea whyyyyyyyyyyyy
no skarm turn yourself in!
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
that took years to make
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
yay!
you caught me
i return with cake
good job master (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
well if he constantly says he’s 11 and to leave him alone because he’s young but acts like 11
she plays a lot of characters besides twilight like timmy turner

!image twitch lol
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
nintendo should make all the main pokémon games available on either the 3ds/wii u virtual console or if the switch ends up getting a virtual console
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
i think
damn
dismebarks

:feelsannoyingman:
uh oh.
plus, you can’t take pokémon out of certain areas until post game. and the 2nd and 3rd games have side quests
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
wowsa.
and took the free money
and it uses jpeg images
its a collage of 3 images one of them being negated and all of them being mirrored diagonally
it's the perfect pink nu quote
later, squid.
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
i got a really good paxel and scepter.
you mean loot cubes with a mob spawner?
now that that's over with, can i wipe my rank and start over?

boring
hey, i was going to eat that squid
by the way, wolve.
remember kids, always make the best use of your situation
because they feel like it
but does a tough battle make a good character?
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
and we're done
same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
please dont blow up dan
oh god, he's lost it
shadowmere

ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow
work is never fun
correction: if had some entertaining features in the netcode
i just got back from work
good, it's working
that's what i thought
what story
oh dear
i never play competitive games though, i've always been a solo player
the ocean one?
shoving off to sleep, was nice knowing you, etc, dont burn the place down, etc, etc, etc
i’m back from work ya ninnies
unless his discord username is different now.
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
im confused now
and now im gonna feel like an asshole when it turns out he had a perfectly valid reason not to come in
ughh, i have to do bleak falls barrow to do the civil war?
you ate some thing edible
fucking bullshit
100% oj, 2d game.
thats how high up we are
tell the physics gnomes to stop fucking around
avicii was just found dead
seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
no, that is incorrect
argonian?
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
this is healthy
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
sounds good
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
i know
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
well i found my 5 weapons to go for in pre-hardmode.
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
hmmm

although i broke that trend.
well i like luigi for reasons other than dabbing
won't have to do those things for another year
you fit right in here. =w=
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
do i get another trophy for level 60?
just the one.
no you just havent caught up with death yet
the formula was n² + n - 1
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
we didnt do much abs in precalc
hang on
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
why are we talking about trees now
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
yea, fun fact i never named my chanel after him, i was trying to be original but still naming myself after something related to space
assholes need lessons taught to them
so clearly he knew he screwed up
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
or given my personal rating
hotball is undoubtedly the best in the world right now
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
looks like java doesn't care master lul
hotball1 is, to date, the only person who's ever beaten bloodbath on 60hz
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
how would you plug that in?
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
he made me face palm so hard
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>

chocolate chip would just mean generally anything that isnt vanilla
nice
public class dragonite{
arent sata cables generally easy to get a hold of though?
what ~~class and weapon~~ bow do you have?
gummy arent you the one with the super fancy gaming pc
*kinda*?
yeah close enough on the zeroes
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
just finished physics class
when was i supposed to learn this shit
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
as opposed to the double-precision one
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
it's great
<:lul:305559915714576385>
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity
now do it recursivley
that chaos!

and then went rogue.
oh great!
i’d do it if i felt well
happy revenge of the 5th everyone <:kappa:374346980136058893> is that even a thing? my friend who loves star wars said that so it must be, it oughta be.

probably shouldn’t have sat on him...
"don't get me wrong, i love lamp".
in a text bubble.
he’s my dog now
master would be proud.
20 secs to load pc

i'm was never hired
what were the questions?
dragonite.debts.master.owe = 0;
never timed it though
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
my tavernkeep in terraria is named blacksmith
do you what?
it seems we are at an impasse
so when does google make a nation and we end up in some dystopia where they own everyone
he was saving it for a party tonight
and only assholes do that
mmmh
i’m back from work ya ninnies
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
well yeah
i’m back from work ya ninnies
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
it’s fun
thats true, maybe we'll get a gtavi within ten years then
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
because only high quality shitposts make it through
    }
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
shhhh
no, square the temperature
nah rainy they were being crazy amount of bitch
what do you think?
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
i kinda wanna frame it
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
then you are safe
go faster than camera take picture
reverse reverse
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
something about technicians
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
yeah, i think that’s important
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
slow clap
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
what here needs modifying?
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
real java meaning notepad++ and cmd/
lol bob the builder
i cant remember how it works now though
3+4=5
im a doof
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
welp
i think 5-24-25 is also one
i like casios but the rest of the planet likes the texas instrument
why?
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
it's not
idk who to pick though
same
it was thanks to war that got me in this mess
sometimes relationships just take time to heal, other times it may be for the best that they never do
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
like doubling numbers
theres those junimo huts you can get
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
it's not like the class is experimental
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
oh grad party will be safe
why are you upvoting
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
yeah we know
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
only one way to find out
~~phanpy.~~
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
it was only 20%?
either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place

i can truly live in the 18th century now
also met a new friend at the party
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
i want some more twisted ice tea
get one for everyone here too
that was exciting
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
$1.26 a liter
obviously
i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
way less pollution
i forgot my wallet and came home
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
smart bois
go for it
is it all private?
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
there's at least two in my colossal cave adventure knockoff that i sent you a few days ago

what?
good luck with that
i guess you aren’t hungry
i like to take credit for that
ouo!
none of them are done well, however
so i have confidence that i'll qualify for the course
<:lul:305559915714576385>
in javascript and game maker anyway
gummy remind benny that im rooting for him
though if i could i would
in java decidedly not
the following year students were not permitted to change the wallpaper

oh there once was a hero named ragnr the red
so i was actually going to do something productive but napoleon total war is calling me
i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol

how about chant du départ
modern rap is like saying classical music
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
then why side with him if you're gonna betray him anyways?
they make such satisfying noises when they die
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
welp a 15 minute talk about math with my dad turned into an hour and a half debate about god
it's just my phobias make the game hell for me
oh hey gummy, hows the windchime?

n(n+1)/2

we are not enabling the bot to post memes
but, i really enjoyed it
it was an automated message <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
someone called me earlier. i didn’t answer, but he left a voicemail saying he wants his money back and then bye
if benny is illiterate how could he play the slots?

it's okay youre not supposed to be able to remember elven names anyway
youtube has done it again...
friends decides to troll in server
used that 4 cheese-blend
don't sully that name by bringing it up here
what’s pride and predjudice?
the plane game was nice
nice
since everyone has a different role and in the same category
brb looking for cheese
how about napoleon total war?
i beat you in that
with a sawzall and a blowtorch
this is pointless
you suffer from a condition called not nerdy enough
it is always the time for java jokes
i dont remember that but that thought got a chuckle out of me
thanks
the russian empire sucked after tsar alexander i died
nothing?
you called it
that's a surprising thing to hear from you
because
also was asleep 2.5 hours before you sent that
you just put a kitchen in that house
once again the asshole made me super mad
so are we
it ends on may 28
i have something very nsfw for you gummy
dialga
what did you get, dialga or palkia?
same but that is a good one
why not have a paint concert or a lumber concert instead
no rap
drago
im about halfway through melting down cookies, garlic, and bread into my stomach, if theres anything extra stupid going on today please ping

it’s 7:32 and i already feel like going to bed. help
dp2 is almost starting soon

thank fuck
simpsons has been going on longer
though i wish i did cape, i hate it when people mistake me for a *shudders* straight
spongebob is better now
it was
i couldnt stand ash back in like season 1, where have you been
i think rc needs to hang out with gummy more
and once i find my mic i'll get on for what will probably only last until i either a) go meetup with friends to binge a bunch of shows or b) we decide to play the vidya games
now i want cheese
shush panda it's more fun to blame me
what foobar thing?
who was the asshat who called it foobar?
it's more or less a religion thats one of those stereotypical ones i guess
> dragonite
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
it's deja vu all over again
inebriated
just saw deadpool 2
i call the english language the language of anguish
im seeing ads for barbecue and getting extremely hungry
if it's written out you can decipher, at this point with speaking i don't think you could understand if they used spelling or grammar correcty
flubs can you give me 10 examples of ideas that aren't a theory
flubs
sooooo
nothing happens
i should probably talk here more
why does it feel like he never streams anymore
lol, day off, if only
have fun with that
~~yourself?~~
flubs you gotta watch this amazing show that i am currently watching
ida!
well then back to yelling at people for pinging other people
~~i think skyrim is going to be on your phones now~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
god damn it how am i still in the lead?
camelot 2.0 is falling apart because i hesitate on decisions
what separates an idea from a thing?
what?
can you ask her to let me finish my finals first
very carefully. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
like linear algebra, number theory, topology, etc
then i can get into differential equations
differential equations fascinate me, i wanna learn about those eventually
if i put the same effort into my other classes like i did math i'd be amazing at everything in school, lol
cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
my ap history course for next year just assigned their summer project
it was invented when a supercomputer was injected with 12 tons of meth, 3 tons of weed, and a pool-worth of lsd
yup looks like it
not the best, but also not terrible
im pretty excited just to dive into calculus
okay, now that i think about it, lets go is gen 1
because gum doesn’t ban
what have they done?
so i just decided to make a text adventure rpg and implement sound
but you guys never talk when im here
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
nice
if we’re taxing people now...
i throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~hole in the wall~~ window
time lapse snapshot
hai friends ^w^
must not damage the pages
i wanna come back to fun stuff to read
no idea.
c—a—n—a—d—a
does dragonite not like bluej
because i have no idea how to make an algorithm that will do this
forgot about that one
eyan is starting the sequel to jersery shore
been a little while since auto pin kicked in
did you even hear a word i said
oh wait do you mean one that i actually use?
meh i hate how all my plans have changed
have fun with the penguins, flubs
when i wake up in the morning, i instinctively look on discord and youtube.
i think this is the 3/4 time
i did once
i was going to say flubs' current missiles are probably more explodey but i guess not
exploding footballs break?
brb food
no pink
is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
n = o/u
as long as my pink is unchanged i couldnt care less
yeah because my voice is fabulous <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466>
i was in a squid?
bc i have reason to
i'm sitting here uploading july's videos because that's how far ahead i work because i'm stupid
had to rewatch my stuff and i did do a good job
oh yeah
hmm what to pick
everything looks the same....
that's a little bit gross
time for new friends yes
but didn't you already graduate
cool...if only the military was like what it was once wa
racist
i must say, it is rather amusing to be looking for an enemy that turned invisible and then finally when they turn visible again they're having a seizure on the floor due to the paralysis thing
oh no
oh yeah, it's officially gay month
and you arent even told what is incorrect,just that it is "incorrect"
relatable
should be
im doing a rare editing stint so ill join later, probably
im gonna work on this spreadsheet for like 10 mins and then bother gummy about starting up another conversation
it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
i broke through the part on the left but still
missed the rest of stream, apparently. oh well.
also that separation makse sure you dont have any of the old stupid or edgy shit you put on the old one
what
albino umbreon
im going to yell at people today
exactly. games are a form of art
nice

good job
you should know im a brony
personally, for me i would never even bother with the dock if there's a cable charger
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
yeah blame drago
right person, you thought wrong
and only 1 line of ghost and dragon types; i never liked that
i honestly don’t like muk
for me
because those are funny
i probably shouldn't get too far into it but to give you an idea there was one hitler fan a few months back
i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future
taking latin 4 next year then ap latin

is anyone else not seeing comments on youtube videos because of "restricted mode" even though restricted mode is off
bella we are nerding
i wrote down i was emperor, huge warlord, have absolute power, and my wife is rarity
mommy works too
rc gets what life is all about

as a definitely oppressed gay, i demand these shoes for free
im bored
id make a darwin project video but it doesnt work well with shadowplay
garchomp and vaporeon as well
(long pause)
how'd research on d.js go?
asshole 2 is blocked

whats wrong about senior skip day?
(sarcasm)
you cant punish a student who doesnt give a shit about school

how convenient
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
woah
and im quite sure that the failing grade was a 65
they are talking about star wars
damn thats pretty...okay
in xenoblade or pokémon or skyrim
dragonair and ????
and its so good to kill in it
mine:

i mashed 1
only here master
truly the ultimate pokemon adventure
posted a thing in blackbird
see he's ready
idk master is the guru of names
do stab and boom at the same time, booab, or stoom, whichever floats your goat
i'm biased, it has the word princess in the title
and i like to pretend to be him
i have to smash it against my desk until it comes apart by divine intervention
rip i can't change my server nick to "dragonite - guru of life and laziness"
tastes like licorice
yeah otherwise gummy would be running around with a picture of upside-down rabbits also
i have no idea what to do all summer
12 more days until the old gum turns 18
im watching the news about a killing husky
also did you level up recently?
actually
is that right outside the window?
while master is doing teh maths im also doing math lul
ohhh i see
and im hungry

bottom one master
well too bad
the russian army mostly had peasants as troops, they only had 200,000 regulars
you can't tell the future? what are you? a level 17????
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i’m killing rabbits in minecraft pe version
fast food
wont this just slam my face into the ground
who said we were driving?
(just testing stuff)
she was still following me in boolean but was stuck on the platform for like 80 load screens
or 4
thank
squid you're slacking on your job, you're supposed to give out baconators to people
my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
i just got back onto discord
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
jokes on you i'm on summer break
and then questioning why he's doing any of that work
anyways where was i?
i think sumo was kind of a last straw for him
he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
with the whole "the only people here"
beep
dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
okay thats it brb
stop making me feel old .-.
most of us do
good job master
gummy stop getting deatroyed
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
dont get dragonite started on faces
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
again
woah now no need to cuss
since i essentially finished it today lol
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
aqua
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
i feel like theyre gonna pull something
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
i don’t see you declaring war on countries for no reason and looting cities
the fuck you mean 3 am?
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
misc. stuff
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
hello there
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
we’re a small group
its a very fun game
and really shitty
master you officially have too much time on your hands
beef?
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
you can play wow by yourself too
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
rc you suck
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
(◕ ε ◕)
guys
but i need my analytics
or youll be alive, if you call that living
i just love this movie
sleep now or something bye
on switch
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
ah. meant to type that into a different server. sorry.
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
not in that order
i'm a daisy main for life
but still i'm hyped!
and i'm going to stick with mario kart. and maybe mario party when it comes out
you'd think it would be that easy but apparently this little to-do has been raging for like a half hour now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
or try to hit from far away
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
no part
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
of course ive only seen like 4
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
i don't think it was bad.
one thing i hate: es6 overshadowing the rest of the conference
cake or ice cream?
it just was pointless at the same time
i'm not crying
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
what about double dash?
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
for not being faithful to the original
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
nope
86 years old
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
its been free
e3 was fuckin boring
speaking of which 18 in one week
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
well im kinda not in the mood for jokes
good job 🎉
i’m pretty sure there won’t be as much story and stuff in it
tomorrow will be worse
what do you expect me to do with a bowling ball
they told me im obsessed with warfare
destroyed 8 ships and captured 2
also, squid,
we own the land, we own the planet
then what gives us the ability to claim ownership that the dinosaurs couldn/t
yeah people have to agree the land is yours. which you prove with a deed
function flubslogic(){
well it hasnt
the gamecube was my childhood
ok, it looks like the octo expansion does have a midnight release. 😑
isnt that just calculus
i just wont eat for a day or two
bug/ghost.
dragonite are you in the steam beta?
not to mention the lesson was extremely confusing with backwards grammar rules
haha, yup
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and that was a decoy house. for the times that someone might blow it up
well its also a species but thats unrelated
you should get it, it's really fun but insanely addicting
the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army
just like me
since the rest of my troops were in russia i was forced to sign a peace treaty...i hate the portuguese
majestic spaghetti is overthrowing the bourgeois

eh, just leave him against the wall, he'll be fine
muskets though
it’s poisoned with something
a new royal anthem
this has been a psa. back to your regularly scheduled madness. thank you.
i'll probably never touch an mmo
no you cant
never before in my adult life have i looked so forward to the holidays lol
smash 4 menus weren't the best.
the menus in smash 4 were a mess imo
hey, i was going to eat that chicken thigh

oh hey it's rainy
what isn't happening?
so is unity and unreal
i'm just a blue organ so you don't see me much obviously
~~don't answer that~~
real men do let's plays with their phones
and more often then that, i'm bored
hehe
tends to be how people eat yeah
pretending to not want to die is a full time job
i'm just more active so i can attain red galoer and be haopy
so my teeth hurt today so i had to rely on swallowing most of my food
this is true lol
i had to im sorry
hes mine for now
of course you sellouts would think the common folk are insane
and, demon lord is like 23?
wait 4 years, in the meantime pretend i am
i've never even heard your voice which is pdd
anything after that is when common sense died in it's entirety
persona stuff, you probably wouldn't like it there lol
it's only in place for lesser evolved species
btw told you camelot 2.0 will be successful master
and i've heard will as well
oh yayy
or did i just miss it
yay rc too
also as it happens they're not losing but it's only the third inning so there's plenty of time for things to go wrong

why flubs?
oh so you went to the not populated places
i just don’t like the large jump in levels

that's what they all say
so if the sun were to explode that would be a literal disaster
any cooked pasta is good
random stuff
i hate friendship
like honestly there are better ones than ours
hello there
then its not a virus now
and thats on the complex plane?
i knew flubs was addicted to cocaine
static shock and the zeta project
maybe should have gotten yelled at but whatever

okay what about west virginia
theres no second place in running. theres first and theres last.
and no teen titans is not in the dcau

im assuming this is all weeb shit
i will cut you
the bag with all my shit in it
im equestrian not canadian
shouldnt you have a few med bags for each of the major staypoints?
also i only live like 45 minutes away from the us
this ones ok
why doesnt it give a preview
no i hate it
it's not like it's cold all year long xd
i'm inside flubs' head
insane?
it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
i was surprisingly popular in high school
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
i can ignore the sounds and listen to the words
zeus got it on with a lot of women didnt he?
there can be two moms, jesus christ it's 2018
classic barry
want me to re-route it to algetty?
wolve luigi isnt a millennial
the newest few at least
well yeah
why are there builds?
welcome to rito patching
i type in supergummying and it goes to you
gummy wheres my bag
i need a hobby
not irl
you have failed
sorry deci
msgs here
honestly thats kinda smart
but yeah i can afford one i should get back into gun care
thats why my picture is luigi dabbing
it does
i bought it to give the creator money
last time i used a credit card on steam and other places
rollercoaster tycoon 2
signed in on a school computer now, let's see how long i can do this before the teacher notices
is there a final exam for speech?
the old man from pawn stars has died
yeah he was like one of the only authors i read wililngly since harry potter ended
why must it be really active when i’m busy?
legs are good for things even if you cant use them
weird
flubs is your dog superman
nicholas the second was a dumb ass
they're good
sorry gummy is just rubbing off on me
oh boi, sneaky back at it again with another cosplay
well i've got some years to go
oh, and stephen is going to meet mal in canada for something
she is awesome
hai majestic
much curlier, and benny has brown on his ears
powdered mini donuts are so good, let me tell you
oh boy
man there was nothing like wii baseball
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
im the dumbest person i know flubs
because time paradox
same
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
my report cards don't do that i think, mine would register as a 101 or whatever
we want mario 64
who were the contenders
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
and nothing but
have yet to go to the ben and jerrys place near me in a while tho
and future
couldn't get into it, don't know why
i figured out why she didnt eat this one
almost one year anniversary of something every big
yeah because they suck
the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
but only because
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
and those sandtraps always get in my way
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
actually my road trip might not be that bad because i get to see my pokémon-playing cousin . . .
thats where youre wrong
i resent that statement
july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
you already have all you want from previous events as well
i'll give you 10% of my check
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
do we though?
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
but that's just a part of life
solving in general is my cup of tea
he’s 8 pounds
actually it's personal so i can't talk about it
i lose and lose
hiya
awesome
the exam looks like fun
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
it’s rotten because of stupid events that happened
vista
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
it just amazes me what people come up with
i wonder how many of those are in there
that seems more like letting your rival pick a pokemon first
the french were cowards after napoleon’s empire collapsed
it is, and i'm winning
the french wanted the brits to shoot first
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
then the english did
im sharing memes with friends
whoops
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
that butter replacement is better squid
now it's a civil war
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
drago you are in charge of it now
i am the senate
manman sounds like a good superhero
idk, try poking him or something
good
foooooooooooooooood
who said i was making steaks?
_looks at bella_
divert 1% of bird game to d.js
and yes
no worse
also my video editing job got delay
wanna hang tonight?
4000 pieces just means it'll last longer
thought you had it on the floor
they might've changed a few things since than.
oh i see
do you not know what a stoner means?
whats the old folks home
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
good job
half of conversations are fun
i like music
such is the way of htings
and its almost been a year since the best day of your life
well camelot 2,0
drago gummy called you crazy
but it really isnt that bad
....
no no kill the old people. old people hold jobs and say mean things so just remove them from the equation
or a glock
traditional news outlets think anything that’s animated is for children 😒
chautauqua
i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
my bacon for baconators...
you know what
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
welp
still didnt answer my question
boom
but you wouldn't last
did alienware glue those in or some shit?
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
nice
master
the case i have rn i got for free from brad
upgrade
there is still a new motherboard and power supply
ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)
ram is good for me as well
im going to end up blowing something up
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
i just saw that
thats 3 not 2
the thing with e!commands is that nobody uses them after the first few.days
wait
did something go?
except for like the crash one (me)
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
you want side window?
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel
except for the time i recorded b roll for something while waiting for the professor
not really
my major is video production
and what i got seemed like a devil spawn
now, back to fallout
good to know
what formular?
cpu model?
i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
my sanity
mmkay
spring and fall have allergies though
but i had no clue it was called super tower
mom wasn’t supposed to go with dad and sister to the city but i guess they did
is it valuable stuff?
spring and fall have allergies though
wait, what?
no just 55 million and what i would buy
and you were right
thanks, i mean i think i can reach it since video premieres count as streaming
holy fuck
seriously
la familia went to italy a few years ago
hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
of course you have to be sarcastic...
then eat
fireworks are ez even though i've never tried them
didn’t see that much yesterday
that gummy is crazy?
i meant the former best friends list
well this is the other super tower on this site
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
drago sounds like a robot
why would i switch spots with you? and what are we switching spots with?
how come i still do?
what is life's greatest illusion
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
no gummy
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
yay single buddies
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
of teeny tiny pizza
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
oh please i've done and said worse, now i wanna hear it
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore
oh i called one of the mods in a server "favourite little mod"
you aren't even on the list
there's no max level anymore
<:treason:396483914803445761>
i am the most crazy
(◡‿◡✿)
got th modding yet?
i wanna get the duck blown up by the ship
can't believe wob found a loop hole through rule 8
“some people live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world”
*throws the sentence out the window* i suggest you start over
ooo another pokemon argument
im actually psychopath level according to both online and irl people who know me well
i mean im doing it im third person
“i do not know when the fire in gummy first burn, perhaps he always had a destiny...”
enemies (drago) and peoplei despised (drago)
the pokemon tournament
teaching the bot to sing is the best thing i ever did
and guess what you aren’t in it!
even though they weren't even in that server to begin with
i got a sword
why is the rum always gone
i meant acorn gun
i want the roleplay
imma break something
i want rum right now as well
xenobald
perhaps he always had a destiny, but sometimes destiny can use a little help..or even an argument"
panda and squid sound similar...
the irony of that.
but i need something more powerful
whatever you say fantom
thats what i have so fay
how have you not gone insane yet?
gummy the south pole is not the equator
what i should be doing: taking the dog for a walk
｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
goddamn emote isn’t working
:ya da:
for some reason, “ta” kept getting autocorrected to “ya”
would have taken me days at home
reroll that dream
im supposed to be a wailord master
i am angry
i dreamt i got promoted to mod on pony server for one week but i had to change my name from supergummying, rarity gif expert to supergummying, wailord master
wait
is that <:treason:396483914803445761> i see
you rang
im refering to the server theme nto the usual topic
subway
six perfect for tampa bay
im not sure if that's how it works
fineee i;ll ask ida
he’s my new best friend
im going to get a sylveon gif maybe
bunny would probably just chew on the cards
who else do i fight?
you need more
thats why i asked you about the writing to a file in java
....
what smirk?
whee
okay rainy
big brother feature
you always agree with me
it’s fun <:keepo:327304799919800321>
it’s usually ida that drags me around
well i could always drag ida in the roleplay
where is luckyskarm?
but i want to know how fallout ends
intel® core™ i9 7980xe (18-core, 24.75mb cache, up to 4.4ghz with intel® turbo boost max 3.0)
how are we boring?
traps are so so gay
well
editing an advertising video for him
case should come tomorrow or wednesday
my stuff came
cause its unrealistic for some like dragonite or animal man where those might be used in a different context
okay the bot can mention people but i've trained it to not in most circumstances
i don’t wanna video edit
im not complaining
don't look at me it's not my fault we're out of phoenix down
but um
dead yes
and there was one more?
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
ever since he collab and made friends with people
1327 for me
drago's forum friends got the boot
he is using fimora
i think i know a place
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
do we call him dragobro?
why do you think i leave this place all the time?
oh hes offline
i tried that too
so it is
burn your phone
that’s pretty much it
'; /                          5555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555563 m                          50..7uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu858965555\\\\\\\\\\\/
thats not full ap thats kayle
i just got baned
and go on from there
30 mins later
hmmm
it's okay, life's a joke
so is renpy
i embrace the magic
the serailzable shit?
never heard of him
you are no fun
he’s a great guy
so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
nobody does
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
i'll fix it some other day. for now, code.
someone explain to my sister what a raspberry pi is
/r/history
complicated bullshit
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
what server?
and gummy, have you considered gitting good?
you can guess which one this is
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
i have my own bad counter this time around
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
have you injested enough of your namesake
i need to get in my pc again
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
why's that?
perfectly balanced
k both hard drives are good
reading patch notes is for losers
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
a guy posted his setup in a server and i saw for the first time an extended super tower
while others say i don’t
now to move the processor over
i never read the rules
they're good for your health
pretty
that’s just a toaster
youtube recommends dogs getting tased videos
like this
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
what about those bean boozled ones?
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
oh finnaly
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school
dont nom
be grateful.
thats not your pc
flubs is like dead
guys let's just face it, eyan streams when he has time
i said i thought it was wednesday in another server
windows products
the royal navy is better than winter
other than that summer is brilliant
i mean technically you said it last tuesday, so....
isn't gimp available on linux
gummy did you say "a terabyte" or "eight terabyte"
for the record i don't know what half of these do
that's something i never though i'd say until last year
hang on
you know what? that's like the third time in as many days that i've posted osmething to the wrong server
what is the gift of death?
what am i going off on
i fell off the ether mine a good four or five times
in this windy old weather
im an expert
what is the music of life?
rainy here
well
that’s embarrassing drago and you should feel bad
i'm pretty sure that's the default
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
whats your point?
it grows exponentialy
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
pretty much.
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
i am more insane than everyone here
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
well except skarm
i guess dragonite
and they did great though was hard through discord
but made with science
get rainy to talk to you
well you better send pics
every ten levels
scrub
it was just interesting to look back
and why am i in charge of the vc? thats drago's job
and they turn out like you
that should speak for itself
lucky you
its easy
thats how everything breaks
give me a dollar
break time
dardoch is a bish
i got attacked by a rabbit
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team
reboot first
im actually really surprised
thinkingface
that isn’t pony base
you are in france
so im kinda like you now
theres no way i havent mentioned that
i mean uh
don’t go to venice though
well tbh it explains why benny comes to my house everyday
417 days or 14 months or 1.14 years or about the average time it takes for someone to climb out of bronze
                if (spl.length>=2)
var spl=message.split(" ");
you are good
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
we figured it out
i feel like this is the 5th time the fishing pole story has come up now
no bad
~~we’re all just crazy~~
so you would have to import them on your end
hey master i'm bored and it's too early to make food, tell me something to do with the bot
fuck yeah
and even though you sniped me in saying that i'm gonna type it anyway
i vote option a.
i only cook bad food
i was trixie last week
i hate mobile keyboards
good job benny (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
well, you’re no help
gummy, you really need to read a book on how to make good insults
bari
i said often you troll
it hasn't kernel panicked yet anyway
do `e!setref demon` or whatever you pref
i am
noooo i just lost two pokémon in a nuzlocke
then they travel around looking for that spell she needs
r.i.p. grozard “swormswood” and eletux “elle-ectro”
this is so sad alexa play wonderwall
alright, same
that translate to 
im having heat stroke again
nope i was gone
really?
that sounds amazing, bella.
turns out no....
the one you gotta watch out for is gummy, aka rarity, or whatever he's calling himself right now
when was this?
howdy fellow frands
i come back for one moment and i'm greeted like this? shame on you.
i was pretty young
apprantly so.
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
im the dovahclean
i’ll take his apology as a surrender
welcome to the world of airplanes
or lewdness
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
gonna get led out by security at magfest
that obviously hasnt stopped spongebob
because it will cost $2000
but i hate anime
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.
over your dead body
i thought it was a rabbit
never book a flight for next day
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
oh that reminds me
if so try warframe next
you make it sound like skyrim
im still single, and this is the first time in my life where i'm legit kinda sad about it so there's that
video games
i proposed to her yesterday but realize you were suppose to do that way later
play total war
nice nice
but i found someone even though she is the same one that tried to force me to be trans
i won the wat
i've never traveled by plane and i hope to never really need to, or travel in general
also star wars is ending in 2019
it says the last movie will be 2019
it's not hard
yeah
and took power for himself
she just said the office
because it sucks
fuck
@ rainy
then i will borrow it
that movie was made in the 70s the rabbit has probably been dead for decades
that’s a guy who needs a haircut
you told me benny eats everything
i was inform by my mom
bella
flubs does not have wings
well at least we know its an int
flubs only has left hands
i challenged him to a duel
and threaten to unleash 50 people on the ex
you can slap gummy with it
people are gonna be idiots online
i fight dirty
there are many ways to check a problem
i did this same exact way i did another similar problem but im getting results that dont make sense
i know
alright
my calc was in bloody radian mode
697.0 then
nah not demeaning enough
guess who almost typed their brokerage account id and password into discord again
it took me twice as long as building the shape to add the letters
that sounds like a once-ever-five-year event
cats decided to make me play contortionist in bed for 2 hours
gotta love having a monopoly on mideival bitcoin
it is
why is gummy a fridge?
yeah thats what i thought when it ran on hotel wifi
i tried to scare them
welcome
also it only has one u
you hook the rods onto the enemy or boss and it deals damage every period of time as determined by the weapon.
did you pet the cat
i sleep at 2
nvm you aren’t old enough to drink
0/10 connection skills discord
probably wont be finished with my work and workout in like 3 hours but thanks haha
they will
last night was on the complex plane and demovire's theorems and today is about vectors and ellipses
~~in english?~~
gummy this just cramming
alright
did i hear history
well thats fine, you might bump into someone better
exactly
btw side tangent i saw someone wrongly say "i believe in you" and said "i believe at you" and i refuse to say the correct way
i don't like work
relationships are always hard if youre not 100% ready to be in a relationship, or not sure how to approach it
they could actually turn out to be someone you might not like so it’s a safer option
well
what. is free on youtube. they're both on netflix
stop being picky
what the fuck
alright heres an easy one
until you realize you were being an idiot
when you do it you just come off looking like a dick
ooh we talkin bout exams
i heard the mets lost 25-4 the other day
but it was trending on twitter
i don't know
well ida in runs in he family
i don’t even watch baseball at all <:keepo:327304799919800321>
~~i think throwing him out the window would be better~~
im shoving off for the night don't etc. the place down bye
i ate it
there was a 2017 gummy?
ohhh ideepoo we still need to play civ one day
also, my opinion on video editing is that, why learn video editing when you can put the time into learning something like photoshop
what
imma dinosaur
my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio
this was the girl i told you about that force her old bf to be transgender and me
it's like drago 1500 and gummy 8
imma slap ya
so you will never marry sarah?
drago my heart is not for you
a long term relationship is emotionally and mentally taxing as hell
shes pretty much an objectively bad person but thats ok
you aren't taking my throne
<:gwdogawoophotoblob:402874215759609867>
im at the nicest ive ever been in my life
acceptance
i was suppose to love him
someone eli5 what the point of league is
um you can't do anything though
that is um that is me
idk what you are talking about
i can't picture serious gummy for some reason
bella dont encourage him
remember
hmmm well i am tired master
good idea
which will be ida
also i am breaking wedding traditions
never met him
when you get back
i like your great grandpa already
kinda. we get along
or something
oh dear
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
alright guys since master doesn’t think im crazy and hyper anymore and that i “lost my touch” well prepare to listen to my new theme song
```java
you do it
flubs youll be dead before we extract gas let alone have permanent settlements on another plane
they did but they were affixed to the walls
traitor
something you did to me
thats like half of a train's interior for one section of the thing
gummy, plug yourself in. you’re ruining the orange juice
okay let the birds eat it
man i love super mario world
flubs arent you in italy time why are you awake
needsmorejpg
fiiiiiiiiiine
what do you mean
hello rc, you’ll really like phantomrc
you moved on from super cases when you found out they were real
i feel like gummy rates games based on whether or not it has muskets in it...
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i still have yet to be pinned
opposite of whitesleep
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810> 
they even put that in sun and moon
yes rc.
i am gonna clean it
3 in a half years ago
i really want this pirate game
i found chocolate chunks in my keyboard
i found dust
thanks
im nervous about this podcast
and then it kicked me out
and food crumbs in it
want some chocolate chunks?
so water won’t wotk
ask negative gen 6 questions
i’m back from work ya ninnies
"water wont work because its *somewhat* water *resistant*"
drago
why would i be a home
gummy it's too early in the morning for this nonsense
and bad news
skyrim is overrated
good news i get to meet her irl sooner than expected
see my stomach is not my weakness
i got a new mission
that should be an option
and either way arguing is a sign of a healthy relationship, not an unhealthy one
he also has a pretty extensive wikipedia page
lets see how long this lasts before mee6 flips it back
soon enough that collection's gonna have an integer overflow or something
or go
greetings, squid.
im shoving off bye
drago
flubs i don't like you
what in god's name is going on in here
most peoples first phone is an iphone
theyve done pretty fuckin well
but you just said they shouldnt
lower cost making + higher cost selling  = more profit
that sounds fun
flubs
but its been a while since i've had a full load of courses to deal with so
they deserve it though
like the first 3 weeks of school i never procrastinate i always get the work in like asap and then after that i slowly start to let it slip
brb then
i don't think so
by smashing a keyboard
lately i've noticed i dont really procrastinate assignments but i'll procrastinate everything else like my daily stretches for example
come on gummy
i'm calling the canadian equivalent of the fbi to put a giant magnet on your hard drive
zeke von genbu, chaotic bringer of chaos
ill start catching up to you in about a month
or literally just mythra
who said it didn't?
but at the same time no
they are better if you buy them from their website
isn't that just like
if my relationship works out i will need to learn the british pound sterling
holy shit you did
if wages scaled like they did in the 50s
it hasn't broke yet
function factorial(x){
yea prety much
```
   return (x>1)? x* factorial(x-1):1;
the human race deserves to die anyways
same until warframe
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
}
league is good
god damn i am addicted now
the exam was way easier than i thought it was going to be, i'd rate the practice exam a 10/10 difficulty, i give the final a 5/10 it was really tame
why not
alright now that you have that out of the way go play warframe
plus im like pretty damn good at what the quizzes cover so it wouldnt be very good practice to just redo problems im already good at
alduin plush
those last two lines are contradictory
dont think so
i could have install windows 2000
what?
yea squiddy ya silly goose you
blitz what is my wedding present?
i can't watch this anymore
but my brain explodes every time i try
shake me
do you have a mic stand?
so i take it magfest is a pretty big convention in terms of crowd size
flubs is a smart.
lies and slander
maybe it is
splatcord
imma tackle drago at magfest
man i may love muskets
welp, i've corrected some incorrect intuition now so i'll retake the practice test in a bit to see how i do with the correct way to approach problems i first got incorrect
planes were sturdy
oh god the intro
thanks
interesting
restarted my computer because it was being a butt
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
civ 6 and 5 are amazing
he doesnt play often though so i get it. im pretty sure he just walked into the encampment and lost
or solitare
man i love war
but when i teach you
instead of taking the bus
whiskey?
laptop?
yes laptop
25 minute work on highway
if you never hear from me again you can conclude i was axe murdered
well drago
i suck at getting ayatans
i have no idea what that is 🎉
no idea
i swear this building purposely messes with signals
sorry gummy
it’s not too old
also thing
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
any luck on finding more?
god damn it he's been infected also
that class.. was stressful
no i meant something akin to this type of it
that's like
im gonna try weekly next
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
the relatively saine weekly version
nice
what cant count as a drug at that point
i would say spreadsheets if that didn't count as a drug for some of us. *opens up 3 more in google drive*
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
i had given up on it, but my brother started watching it so i would sometimes turn around and see it
thankfully rhino helps a lot
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
like, the entirety of the ultra space arc is really really good
its pretty much a video thing
oh gosh darn it meesex
i am very upset
tfw warframe doesnt specify how long your locked from accessing your account
my one complaint about it is that it doesnt specify the amount of time until i can again
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing
its just an oversight but yknow
too many password attempts
i didnt want you anyways
welcome <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
and didnt know it had to be an essay until today
that's a line they can access
i wanted to add another class
you had to do that before?
feelsbad
though that one girl is cute
probably because he has to google "most boring way to articulate (x)" for every sentence
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
go for it
i read part of the book and i have to say
no downsides.
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
ping
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
i have this.
i mean like
link.
oh cool
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
omg drago looks lame
its best is an idiot
what's the link there for?
~~well thats cause youre a mod~~
whats the other jo then
my gf plays zombie shooting games and stuff but says animal crossing is creepy
i’m back from work ya ninnies
e sharper pointy stick
play pokemon red and blue
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
in 3
college is stupid
i stopped going in december
6 maybe?
i have one
nah go ahead
algebra is fun
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
that sucks
and that was just to test a thing for eyan
master if you're feeling like self-harm i can put you in contact with some people
hmmm
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
ah, gotcha
that's like the same thing right
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
thats where the secret money comes in
you can just make files end in whatever you want now?
i like how javascript doesnt give a fuck and just plain texts it
i'll take that as a yea
whats that the code for?
if the new program was written properly it doesn't care what the file extension is, and just reads the header data in it to figure out how to parse it
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
they won 1 and 3
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
they were pretty much "don't post anything that breaks international law (((((but if you post it on /b/ we're probably not going to moderate it)))))"
did google give you the answer you wanted to see
which quest?
i’ve been lazy and am probably on the last part of the new strange
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
yeah
but that really is me
with that i'm going to go do food things bye
super weird
100 thieves or tl?
i like how everyone doesn't even comment on gummy's name anymore
a little
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
we've just been so used to it to the point where it's just normal.
god damn it
and no drago
i thought about it
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp
you said so
which one was the one where... ah shit i dont remember any
i told myself i was going to work on bird game starting at 8
oh look it's after 11
i already wave a white flag
he does that in every episode
i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
this is the original video
question answer
shed probably just scream
\:thinking\:
i checked his reddit profile a few hours ago, he got snapped also
so it is
that's because your waifu is shit
whyyy
perfectly balanced. as all things should be
yes to sm
ah fuck tomorrows monday
shit
ahhhhh
my mom is ready
yay the light's on that means the battery didn't explode
stream?
unless she's actually a competent person
the supergummying youtube channel will return
yes, and axes are good at killing pokemon
i need a name
you literally told me to get you banned
notsupergummying
finally someone with some brain cells in this channel
don't forget no wind
i like when ted talk(s)
lesson 1
which is sogno di volare
my theme when i battle drago
i'll beat you in civ and total war
most of it was simply theorizing how long his dragon's penis was
friends?
man i’m still wide awake
wait
<:rooisee:430400878302855177>
slee[
isn't tomorrow labor day...?
i asked
man i need better weapons
tsm got knocked out by c9
rhino skin should make that easy tho?
it honestly doesn’t last long sometimes
a pro at zd
oh god i glitched the plains
it ended up hitting my leg hard
i do!
oh they're league teams
huh. now im just gone in general
now im stuck
game borders are fun
no you don't
since supergummying is a curse name on youtube
lemme get back to you on that
you just can't youtube
ida 514 gummy 0
drago 1563 gummy 0
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
sorry.
the plot's thickness isolates
its not raining, no
is it supposed to be raining?
so water isn't supposed to evaporate or is it just rain that's unremoved?
as time goes on i'm starting to get more and more nervous for calc, lol
yeah gummy about that
oh yeah ive been to _all_ the parties
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
what can it be???
most of what i remember of early calc is basically revolving around the unit circle
i don’t remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
cal-bc was where things were different from what i remember being told
but you will most likely break up before then
thank you
interesting
why is gummy benny?
and yeah what ida said
oh sorry to hear that
>implying family gets even
no she only has 514 points to your zero
im just a wreck now
i know
i mean what?
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
lies
ida actually has finger
fine
are you sure?
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
no, i'm icelandic
eh, it might sound like that
that your icelandic accent is like a drunk scottish accent
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
either way wossman also said it
only
i don't drink coffee
i never swear
i kicked the addiction
yeah, let's go with that
it's 2 am
don't do drugs
that is dr wossname
i remember people used to like him but now they might not
<:mhxsleepy:362261093998919680>
sandwiches are awesome
wow im actually understanding proofs, kugal did a thing!
is she cute?
dont think it works that way
help
what does it mean to not feel tired
i'm streaming gummy, you should throw bits at me instead
they pay better
i need a new gummy
how do you pronounce it?
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
its not the most noble strat but its one that works
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
at least it works
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
dragonite give me your creative writing class
gldd
...
sick
in other cool news
gummy wanna go to creative writing for me?
god damn it
teacher: who knows javascript?
oh wait todays the fifth
ooooh nice
no college for me on thursdays 👀
in lastvillage
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
teacher wouldn't even notice
sounds pretty normal
how dare they
brad and i are in ap physics
so we by extension are neverlucky
about?
university isnt high school
gummy you arent in high school now
i also, hope you realise i had a bunch of circumstances that allowed for me to leave regardless
i get up at 5:30 now 😄
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
huh.
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
physics is fun tho
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
so probably 2.5 math classes
press f for kugal
i love this university now
i liked how, in my statistics class, we could bring a notecard with as many formulas/examples as we could put on it for the final. mine was full, front and back 😛
fuck no
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
also he allows students to collect data together on laboratory assignments
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
greetings, bella.
make your own fork of jslint that doesn't judge you.
and drago no
nice
like 20 minutes over due
can i visit>
hai so delicate
im gonna get phat
thats the answer im going with
for x/x
mathway probably doesnt use a high enough x for its 10^-x
before 0
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
just gotta get another rare rock as an offering first
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
nice
it's about 45 cm away from my head when i fall asleep
okay
speaking of that guy
sounds like a swell time
*breaks whoever thought that waking up at 6:30 was a good idea*
pham
watch me
but i have stuff to do anyway. feelsbad
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
next lesson is on limits at infinity
what
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
from what i've heard and observed
i'm not talking about the observable universe. all i'd say is that if the rest of the universe is not observable, why would we come to the conclusion that it's infinite?
and when you divide anything by zero you get infinity
when the fallout is distributed evenly, the explosion happened everywhere, never showing signs of ending, thus making us think it's infinite
excuse you public static main doesn't compile
keep learning
maybe that was the universe also
i unsubscribed from pbs space time like two years ago because all of their videos were pretty much the same thing
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
unconvinced of what, im confused lol
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
i like to think of it more as the boom happened everywhere instead of one spot
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
arguably yes and no
why do you have so much water?
why the hell was i testing live streams yesterday?
let me go to sleep now
arguably
huh. just finished reading eldest
and apparently the monado had a hidden monado and that hidden monado had a secret dickson that had a hidden monado. and now my head hurts
im slowly moving my desk away from people
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
but i’m sure this semester i will at some point. yay.
i'm over halfway through the day
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
work in terms of what, kugal?
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
draco im going to make _your_ brain hurt
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
mkay..maky..
thats confusin to me
oh okay
spazzer the great
so yeah
delicate is playing
holy moly
and how strong they emphasis that course
<:walkthroughwizard:372149588783529994>
some courses last six months
online courses yeesh
im going to walmart today
the guy just had something and went through the backdoor
you're a criminal now delicate
hey magus i gotchu sum questions
oh dat
are you all from the us?
i haven't gotten the kill order from eyan for it yet
well eh
the role
we have very eloquent discussions here as you can see
but first index runs all weekend for credits
then cardinaloscl is mainly for storing information on a per-server basis so i can have custom welcome message display for the bot.
i use flutter bot
welcome home
thanks i needed that
i think?
oh yeah my dsi had a l button that was perma-on
i joined yesterday
rip superskarmory.net
oh is nick on this server too?
i wonder what gummy wanted while i was making foods
i feel like there's a bot command for this brb
hes fuckin seven during the oldy times?
you tell them how fucking wrong that is
but america has more boat
thats crazy
nice
bc you didnt reply the first 5 times?
well you will if you try to leave america
lmao
ok maybe its a *little* bigoted
yeah and its also much worse. puerto rico sucks now
that's racist
florida wars = seminole wars
imma become a professional poker player
gummy look up the australian emu war on wikipedia it's my absolute favorite
sets of 15 points for the win
that sounds like affirmation
i hope so
the end
or lie down
but the release date for the next update was moved to the 14th
oh btw here to share a rumor
i just finished reading the 7 chapters i was supposed to read by wednesday this week xp
haaaaaaaaaaalp
but i think that can actually cause brain damage
seems like besides eyan
i think i have a photo of it somewhere let me look
what the fuck
yeah that won't work
my headphones are being fucky nobody say anything interesting
he said something about dying
once done with these league games gotta farm reactant
submitted my second calculus assignment. i hope the professor likes it
this leson goes over first, second, and third derivatives...cool
i've taken 42 pages of notes in the first chapter of calculus, wow lol
~~keep subway in the subway~~
nice. i sold my nyx prime neuros finally
i don’t get how, last time i exported a 35 minute video, it took a little under 2 hours to export. today, it’s only going to take 50 minutes instead.
are you eating a subway in a subway?
hey subway is good
wtf why do i have 82 plat now
have fun with that
kill 42 with finishers without going down
bread is nice and stale?
air is stupid
who needs to open them
only the splodiest memes for us
he’s our math boi
i have a total of 54 credits.
not rn
college
hello new person
hello
but i brought wolf
(guys i think the new guy is a perfect replacement for me)
oof mauling citizens is fun though.
don't worry as long as we beat the enemy
hmmmm
(i am officially retiring)
what happened
friend
gummy is replaced
you lied
also make sure you give blitzypoo ding dongs
_dangles treat in front of spazzer's nose_
flubs took care of that
jazz hands
no you cant
i can now
silly gummy
i crossbreeded the explotatoes with corn and made none exploding ones
i would insult dragonite
he did
solve p=np
the p isn't just replaced with a number
no clue
258 in an 8 bit system
xini
see ya gum
isnt that the one thing with triangles
as x approaches 0 of 3+x, the value of 3+x will be 3
"258 in an 8bit system"?
pat friend?
they have to
it multiplies them to that exponent?
yeah no
basically x^-n = 1/(x^n)
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
there is a solution
that wacky character is a radicand
or the existence sign?
probably
so positives make it bigger and negatives make it smaller
compactness
why not use +
whats 0^0
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
yea pretty much
i always had a hunch
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
i used to be smart you know
says you
i have a question
yeah well it's neither
well
it gives an area
when would you ever use long division
yee?
at midnight
an argument in 5th grade
me too
which could approach one
so yep
like geophysics for a magnetostatics course
computers usually cant handle a lot of errors
or a senior actuarial analyst
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know
they own the hospitals?
and you *pay* for it to be harder
then how do they pay for all the expensive shit in them
government owned
welcome to canada
nope
like longer vacations
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want
better credit
thats so weird
you can rent a house easier
so more corporations get involved
free healthcare
no here
jesus christ
they make a lot of money
but your credit rate is in the 800s
do you have a spare or is that your only one
every year
you want mine?
back to volt i go
now to roll it
aw that was short
youre asking me to change chairs, find the thing, come back, switch chairs again, and then talk hushed like so i dont wake sarah up
yeah
if you plan on using melee weapons at any capacity
tony stark
"i am definitely my boyfriend" -gummy just ow

~~i knew ida was never really a human~~

~~lizard9000~~
awww cat
fuck you mom
what gave it away?
my homework can suck an egg becuase i now understand this stuff
i'm your mother, of course i'm of age
i'm hungry
what
seemsgood
help flubs
you are forever shunned from this point on. *shuns the shunned*
checkmate
this is spreadsheet abuse unlike what dragonite has ever seen
ida is mine
no clue
me_irl
that's not scary
anyone feel like grinding for lith in a few minutes
good lord
glad to see you missed me
right now i have a gf to deal with
one sec
all the surv missions have equal drop rates
i was briefly very confused by that statement
i know that
this is dark sector?
do you still need any mesos?
im getting close to having enough for all frames
works for me
thats a no go
am doing a calculus lesson
i'm in a karaoke
being social is the worst
in what context?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
great now i have some racer's life insurance
i need to think of a better symbol for g in my crypt
that's not so bad
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
i didn't want pizza
and freedom fries
papa john's is bad
absolute zero breaks physics
thats just when everything gets boring
leo mcgarry
once you hit absolute zero you can never regain energy
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
among other things the heisenberg uncertainty thing sorta stops working because you know the momentum (zero) and you know the position (unmoving)
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
yeah exactly
once the uncertainty principle fails
probably need more than that for solid hydrogen
so thats 2.4e-15 newtons per atom
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy
i like breaking physics
somewhere
apple products are gross
somewhere
when did i say i wanted a light black hole?
why are there two ses
vanilla chocolate and strawberry
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
of helium
i was talking about solid helium for thep ast half hour
and turn it down to 2%
so its a function and not a method, got it
they were trying to find a cure for something else
and accidentally made penicillin instead
volta
everything changes mass
discord has been giving a lot of poops lately instead of page previews
is that your final answer
when moving
are they also a piñata?
it's great
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  a a aaa   a a aaa          a
youre cleaning it up
you cannot pat me
shoulder to shoulder generally
you're really not understanding the hint
i swear on my grandma's left nostril i've _never_ heard that one before
its healthbar went from 100-0 as soon as the cry for help went down
dragon resists stupid
its not cold enough for skyrim yet
ah ok
it's a fairy explosion
nice
also pretend to be the reverse flash if you feel like it
got it
but its not midnight yet
red is nicer tho tbh
you all thought i was done link dumping when i finished reading all of xkcd? you ain't seen nothing yet
yes that
legend states of a mythical creature that only shows up in chat every once every x minutes and causes chaos before disappearing for an undefined amount of time
me sleep now
i should just ask if i can get all of the papers for the homework/labs/midterm/final right now and turn them all in next week, and not show up for the rest of the semester
is dragonite still screaming on the floor
1) the programmer first sketched the desired classes, before writing the code seen above.```
he knew it too well
how do the peoples of zeal do
holy crap there's a 71% off a 5 pack 100 sheet composition book sale on amazon right now
help
though it should be chill
to gummy i leave my trash bin
later peoples
i was on my phone and was messing around with stuff
or that gummy consults ida on all matters
i got an email...
seems like somehow i sign using my personal facebook
you promised me gummy
i promised you gummy \*if i die\*
oh my god
aaaaaa
yesterday
i buy poké balls in lots of no less than fifty because the only thing i can be arsed to do is hit the `down` button on the shop screen and make it underflow to the maximum you can afford
just go get it from somewhere else
i got a message from tatsu to do my homework but im just wasting time instead
okay who stole my bagel bites???
how are you typing then
i did not
i'm doing my homework
stop messing up the universe, it's unhealthy you idiot
and thats the start of skynet
youve broken my legs. how will i get to work now?
atlantic

they can if they try really really hard
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
i dont think
i think therefore i am
no i set it on fire
the moon
like wasting time
oh yeah big block of cheese
you know, i think sometimes it's better when it's not really active
drago
hello there
the moon to where
someone lost the sign
imma look at my next calculus lesson
is that a yes or a no?
holy moly it's a short lesson too
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
it tastes like stale nothing
just dont do other things
neato
youve never had anything
you're a plant?
also known as: colds suck
til kugal is outside the universe
i dont mind english
i hate freshman and all they are made of

and im still horrible
what
away faithful servant
oh no, now he's ripping off animal\_man\_.
what
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
did it have victory road music?
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
i technically sent someone somethign nsfw once
yeah yeah
work takes away my motivation to do anything
if i was friends with only emotionally chaotic people
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
that's all im gonna say on that matter
and last night he was having a tough time
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
so i'm worried
im just worried that my family will disown me when they find out im dating a transgender
ida you’re stable enough
so think what would happen to me
i'm just complaining about you using an adjective as a noun, tbh
or mugged than shot
so it’s tough for her when her family calls her a guy
eh i'll take it
welp
mugged then shot
so how is my replacement?
will they shoot you through the screen?
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
that was the last thing i needed for boltor
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
kinda
no it's just a big lava lamp
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
no just the comic pages
im serious
we'll see what happens faster: my beard reaches the floor or you finish sm
drago i’ll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
slam the door
what game can we play together
like mount and blade
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
mind stone: yes
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question
but i want a giant cupcake
volleyball
oh youre playing dodgeball or something
my physics teacher roasted me today
that's fun too
also i think i have 20 neo limbo relics
there was also pizza and i drank a bit too much lukewarm tea
oooh
why is that surprising
if this was fight club
oh i guess i did
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
now it'll be pretty
do people not do that
i wanna fight andi now
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful 🤗
the best part about that was when i got home
how so
getting assigned an essay on the same day its due
welp
oh shit
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
to be processed
im already used to spazzed making no sense but i dont get what rainy is talkin gabout either
you considered streaming?
enterntaining in general or if youre there rainy?
good job
boy oh boy
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
he died from essay overdose
yo cool
have you tried warframe?
i dont know if i should be in awe of the internets stupidity or appalled
i just hope i installed my graphics card stuff correctly
i dont hear you at all
i'm still here tho
absolute values linearize absolutely
why smelt a katana
oh wait
on the bright side, this 20 pound chunk of scrap metal is great for working on like muscle stability
is that a quantum mechanics joke
shipping a sword, that is
never trust a bunny
discord stop sucking
you're hearing me
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
bunnys be evil i guess
the latter of the two
raise the air sirens the pants are on the loose
don't?
shit not again
no cookie would ever combine chocolate with tomato
thirteen doesnt exist
where did they run off to this time
apologise to google
your job is to beat yourself?
but i like it flubs
what is that?
hold on im turning dead robot zombie hearts into jedi focus points to let myself have better mana regen
and he like discover gravity
like an eagle piloting a blimp
its nice
no idea ive never played it
same
where is jeff and the winter raid on that scale?
worst
i was playing a hexadecimal arcade game and got a bit behind on cs notes about date time storage even though he was talking about dd,mm,yy and hh,mm,ss and i explained unix to him after the class was over
uninstall it or turn off the phone if you have to
i can't understand
master's grandma confirmed to be gummy's professor
missed half the notes
i write notes on my laptop for film class
she would be mistress8998
to be honest you're not of magnitude to be a headache
eh could score around a b
or in university it's different
citrus just got a lot more fun
all the while java being noun.verb().verb().etc.
nice
so microwave your phone
look at these nerds getting sleep
hai gummy
easy
flubs
oh ok
i heard flubs
is a service doggo?
what happened?
oh i thought it would have been more like bumping into him hard
but why would you do that?
speaking of which
that's rude
or rawr
yeet i ruined everything
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
just got back home
almost two?
also my parents are helping me open a bank account which is cool
i just email the lady my info and she does all her facy stuff and my parents do other fancy stuff boom bank account
it's been a long time
something like that
but no one ever asked for my solution
then you just roll that up in a layer of antimatter and bam you created a black hole
definitely
as many potatoes as is humanly possible
thats the best name
e!skarm original joke
there are infinitely more solutions where p != np
salt
fuck yeah
e!kill dragonlite
also his friend is a fast man with a funny mask
he is the largest
oh man i have figured out statcrunch
hes great. he also has an evil twin who makes you eat fire
also speaking of getting good at dark souls i hope i can do that soon
""don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018
do you mean patches
abomination of nature
"don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018 -spazzer the great
everything
it's larger than a gallon
now go get a gallom of ice cream\
nerds
it's funny the 16th time
typically we discuss the bunches of reading we do. really depends on the authors. like we go on about their thoughts on matters important to the time.
i don’t like them either
disturbing the peace
i haaaaated reading lord of the flies
isnt harry potter just the bible but on even crazier drugs?
oooh
oh dear bella
since we had to pick the book
i read them all way back in elementary. good times
true story apparently
a different read but a good one nonetheless
well, more like 2
they’re more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
my first thought was the millenium pyramid or whatever it’s called
i dont think the level of math classes im in were determined on my smartness really
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
bite sells for a nice chunk of plat and forma is self explanatory
depending on what you mean on hole, sure
or were you thinking yu-gi-oh and you though of the pieces?
i like this green fellow
friday has ida
here too
wait what
that too
its a 3 letter word, do you expect it to never come up in conversation?
its free
squid you are an invention from phineas and ferb
hes a bac*onator* not inator
also known as the eastern roman empire master
allow me this as a late birthday present
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
does that count?
it broke like, 4 times?
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
i discover donations on twitch
oh shit yeah
turn my name back to green! pls
tbh i had some interest in romans, a little greek and egyptians
honestly who needs to remember these things when you can just draw a little picture when you actually have to
i would pillage rome
you should give him all your money
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
then again i might not, i'd have to add up my credits and see if i can fit it in
kugal why are you in an english class
well she went to look for a female eevee with a nature she liked
the introductory cs course is 3 credits
i agree, good point
i imagine that's relatable
wouldnt that make it harder to digest
i enjoy english
and?
do you mean outside my apartment or in general
ok so maybe it was one
she called me many bad words. also called me an "ungrateful bastard"
that's a noni
not sure what i should be grateful for
it's strong
what do i do
exponential derivatives are that easy?
but then i realize i probably was being mean
last 10 mins of ap physics was throwing around paper airplanes
it was like $129
well go get a cat
is that still a thing
go play with your cat or something
and pet
also i like this part of the chart
have you ever tried to teach a cat tricks?
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
i thought all moms did this - no not really
plus i cant drive cos im a moron, lol
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
whats the advantage of online classes
i wish i could say the same
ive brought this on myself havent i
driving is easy
i like that
which enhances it for me
i hate it when that happens
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
wow my stat test today is 5 questions
wait
nope they dont offer math130 😦
appreciate it buddy
ouch
100%on stat test woop woop
nintendo direct just happened
wait
also good job
not anymore. now theyre dead
good
whomst aboot
hooray for books and food
a what did a what and played what and where was i
you just answered your own question
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
that's a good amount
there are too many darn fortnite videos
drago you have to hear it to know it
nice
you know i said in the literal sense
my goodness
squid dont encourage him
oh cool whens that coming out
i gotchu squid
anyway, for warframe, i've heard rumors about that going on the switch, so i'm not too surprised with it going on the thing plus it's on every current gen console thus far
you'd have to design games for instances regarding the multiple modes the switch has, though
~~xenoblade x~~
there’s no 2nd “s”
i know mario maker hasn’t
plaaaaaaay something else
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
they kinda have ongoing costs
im actually rewiring slon to be 2% cleaner
gta v is pretty expensive. now that one is pretty crazy
he didn’t like our money talk
so why not put your games on the money printer
nice
and also steam prints money
nice
if its on steam someone is gonna buy it. example: i bought 8 copies of robot rollerderpy disco dodgeball
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
me rn
axi s3 and v7, specifically
how do you think that is?
fucking finally an s3
i should just learn to code in my sleep
you’re in the path of it?
and the answer checker liked to do things like mark `x=5 m/s` wrong because it was looking for something like `x = 5 m/s`
decisions, decisions
fuck it
so i have an english essay tomorrow
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
im already getting started on my essay
except for yesterday when the janitorial staff kicked me out
(okay so a half hout later im _actually_ going to make an effort to kick myself off the computer bye)
just looked at it. it’s crazy how far and wide it hits the east coast
i just spend my day off doing all of my homework
t=+1 hour and still cant sleep, as per usual
you dedicate one day to homework?
where is dragonite and what did you do with him
i need problems to invent stuff to solve for a class
hmmm
can you react with both to this message
priorities are s3 and v7
technology has gone too far
give me problems
this is nothing.
he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp
heko
*slaps roof of cipher* apgt dpewp trebawqq bfdoq horcwhp
convert back later
add me if you want
*smacks cipher* this bad boy can block so many people
am or pm
hes helping me with my resume
i live on the edge
out of astronomy, time to finish this english essay
so how did you decide i would get that one?
or is that just a random one in my possession?
im up for grinding now btw
new pokemon looks amazing
greece
i should demand a refund on the grounds that the computer science department isn't excruciating enough
eh, i'll do it tomorrow
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
look at the picture
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
thats the time that matters
flubs do you rule the world?
i got a good insult
fair enough
learning games
nope
so much frigging effort
im pretty sure its legally impossible for a disabled person to hold a position of power. have you *seen* all the stairs the buildings in dc have?
he wouldnt take the thing with him
today i learned that dippin dots has its own cereal.. :
whatcha up to
alright just venka gauntlet and scindo blade left
who's good with computers here btw?
aqua relic grinding?
and again it won't stay in the middle of the screen when i drag it there, and reopen it
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
with nothing to play it on because when i suggested i get the ps2 that was $10 more than it instead and i told her i only had one game she said to get another game
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i really need a better rhino set up 🤔
watch as it's amiibo festival deluxe
nope
no effect
i need a sister that fits under my category
why is that even a question
me hungry
oh the horror
if i ever make fun of your code style again just remind me that you have a twelve-year-old sister
your dog making cat noises
this is what a mudbray sounds like
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
my hearing is pretty bad
my gf making mudbray noises
and put your ear next to his stomach
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
like how there’s a venom movie without spider-man
i had no reference so i thought they were good
flubs
emo spiderman.
and also the first kirby game but that doesnt count since it's only like three levels
maybe if you're still playing in like 1 - 2 hours from now i can certainly play
barely <:roothink:399827523581771796>
demon lord stop being old
speaking of skyrim
sure so you just *happened* to shoot me through the smoke and a wall
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
panda stop
"cane" -> [kayn]
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
it's from that one berenstein bears book
alright
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bonus fact: i would've done it anyways
kugal wanna trade sisters
you shant be forgiven
<:gwnonaismug:373159826525519872>
hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
i too like panada's
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
good job windows
did someone say chickens
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
update the update
flubs
hey master fun fact: you're at least 85% of the fact i don't believe in the pc master race
bye pnada
you should joint he party
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
demon lord why must you encourage gummy thus
flubs let's be honest
ida is still up 👁
exactly
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
master are you compensating for something
there's a green and blue
gummy is cheating
master stop being stupid, demon lord stop trying to argue with stupid
i update it monthly
its not a toggle
do you keep up with this or is it constantly updating?
twitch twitch
bella and aminal
over summer break i filled out about 78 sheets for a group and they were oh jesus what the flip is that
in other news dogs in cars are fun
yeah
no i mean like all the other people who are red you cant see it
i played as waluigi i think
hello hello hello lol ^w^
i have officially bandwagon from tsm to c9
you can only trade primes
be at worlds
bothering mom about useless shit
or an array of booleans
to what degree of certainty do you say that
i don't even hate zven/mithy
i mean
i believe so
now i'm getting flashbacks to chessmaster 9000.
which is their week 1
today “drop the whole fucking team”
anasa 10
nice
socjust block everyone on twitter gummy, easy
i just import it to gimp
or stay off twitter
the one holiday i hate
got 3/5 becuase of the screwed up questions
can you display that to three significant digits?
hey kugal
yeah but master if you work the night shift that implies you can sleep during the _day_
thats about what i expected
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
good job discord mobile
yesterday “we are gonna 3-0 c9 and crush everyone at worlds”
two hours until class starts and i dont have anying to do and my phone's on 30%
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
hey kugal
ask him if i can turn it in as my poetry assignment for my writing class
i was charging it and totally forgot about it
see pins
hmph
i didnt do any of that yesterday anyway
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
trynig to get boltor prime now
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
what skarm
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
they weren't very easy essays either
food poisoning is just buckets of fun at kfc
also salty
maybe
taco time
im with you gummy
i agree
can i have any leftover tacos?
tacos and the tears of yellow dragons
thats where we get tacos
mission so far successful
did someone say tacos
cavalry charges
what are the reqs?
a massacre
film class showed me a movie on that
complete a survival mission with level 30 or higher enemies without killing anyone
ahh i see kugal has discovered the internet
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
i just don't know if the mod itself is good
last i checked soma was considered good
my head feels funny
i'm in the mission
or just shave the entire face
i prefer that
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
thats like asking why a baby needs food to live since it needs less than an adukt
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i havent been paying attention
much easier
nope
this does not bode well
stop being so smart you weirdo
darn
flights
trippy smooth version
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
be nice flubs
yeah
i hated mike and a little bit of zven and mithy
not after what he just did on stream
nah listen anyways
though i rather c9 go to worlds
four to seven pages
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
anyways brb playing aatrox
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
ooh that’s pretty
my physics teacher said he likes how he picks on me and i just roll with it
nice
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
well who knows maybe i deserve it
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
nobody does
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
oh cool so the new 2000 series cards are a waste of time
ah, gotcha
remake voicemeeter banana in js. <:keepo:327304799919800321>
my advice is stop being a bitch baby and if they want to be a bitch baby let them
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can’t buy and have no use for
it's torture
you know how a couple
so you can find what you want, write it down, and then buy it from somewhere specialized
home depot is great
they also have metal
rona is better
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
sure
write about a space ninja
gummy be nice to the hardware stores
![]==[]
chuck*
i should clean out the pins one of these days
"and here we have a super gummying in his natural habitat"
and drago can be a guest on the show
no be mean its funny when someone else does it
previews are nice sometimes
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
like e!kill but cheese
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
e!wolfram 13 gmt
there's kiosks to trade prime parts for them
he comes every two weeks
i had someone in my server thinking the nazis were good...how does this happen in a non public server
~~good point.~~
i googled it and wish you luck draco bc i wouldn’t know how it’d go together either
let people major how they wanna major
i don’t want
how was i supposed to know drago
it's like forcing a biologist to write a paper on physics
oh the history major thing
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
balls javascript doesnt have a `choose` function
well thats sucky
it missed obviously.
this is very disheartening
but still
i dont even like _one_ -page essays
who had the changed
tmw your code doesnt work all afternoon and you finally figure out why
firefox > chrome anyways
new life goals?
i got 1 fact wrong on my astronomy lab and that dropped the grade by 10%
i'm in the middle of figuring out how to use the wikipedia api to generate content for my homework assignment for me
such is the curse of ham thursday, that most cursed of thursdays
for three hours
and they sell for more typically
yall wanna run an axi s3 radshare
so the show of my daily life is gonna get exciting
ham is gross
nothing
i remember back in 2nd grade i really liked ham and cheese sandwiches
when i met him i was more successful
well corphish is successful
fuck
i can't believe i got all of ember's stuff in the minimal possible runs
oh yeah that one was hard
lemonade
it's true, grades k - 8th i literally didnt know anything
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
often 8 +
oh hell no
yea if you're getting a phd you're basically saying you want to stay in school until you're like 30 +
go for it
my mom went back to school at 36
i’m not into the camera work at aaaaallll
well gummy could be a film and history teacher
or editor
remember stay single and don’t do hard drugs
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
ha ha
im not single
drago
there is tension
gotta do 5 waves with objective taking no damage on lvl 30+
hah. time zones.
i need a phone with 8 gb ram to handle my spreadsheets
hello there
joaquin phoenix as joker is actually really freaky
damn sleep
woo 100% on astronomy test
i did use a spreadsheet to check myself though
kugal stop being smart its too impressive
kavat cudes up rn if you need them
or maybe just that boy with the hat
it's the sylveon pfp
youd need like 15 of them though
how is that going?
too bad i still have no idea how to get bacon in this game
i want the frame for myself but im probably not gonna go all out like for rhino
just get my sister to entertain her
first day of fall and it should be 90+

:dragonitewasamistake:
my irl sister caught a cold
she is sick though
i am going to report this to the un
im gonna zone out to space music the rest of the day
sorry to hear that flubs
but then again driving on li looks horrible
~~wasn’t the internet always stupid?~~
vsauce michael here
unfortunately the people who do drunk driving and road rage also happen to be the people who are least likely to give up their keys
same
through x^.5 form or?
im guessing itd just be the factorial of the factorial of the original number
6th i think actually
i just gave you a much better name for it
yea i think i may just use double factorial
kugal is a happy boi
man one assignment for literature takes a few solid hours, its impressive
author master
don’t know yet
yeah but being an author is risky and dependent on success
i’ve come to realize i’d rather be happy and doing what i like than be unhappy and dreading work everyday
good idea
i should teach kids war
who?
oh yeah peaceful places
play them my songs in return
how the fuck will more music help me hear less music
gummy dont you have anything better to do
mostly chroma doing tons of dmg
probably
stellacor
i’ll let you know
3 teralysts, one gantalyst, and one hydrolyst
what are your pc specs?
its got two mods for roar rhino
basically i am gonna take everything i learn over the years for this
no, flubs is the demolition expert
but i have stat work
thats flubs
no joke
im docking your pay until you improve
i had curly fries
oh yeah and about 400 vomvalysts but those die so easily i lost count
oh that's easy
wait is it without getting detected or
i ran ivara stuff way too much
on a closed interval
iirc i got pretty lucky with t3

huh, is that right? lol
its a t3r3 low chance drop
orta is like the second best price one
thanks!
pluto junction here i come
i just look at the wtbs until i see a good one
after 7 more missions than shouldve happened
i have a key left if you two want to use it
thonk

oh wait my sub expired
yeet selling out is awesome
well thats why we call it a raspi usually
what the crap it's autumn now?
there are phones that cost over $2000?
wow this is.. a lot
i say to the canadians in the room
you don't
its just slush
not looking forward to walking to the bus stop in -20 weather tho
winter time is magfest time but im pretty sure thats just because winter coincides with when the convention center is cheapest
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
that takes skill
if they ever do you restart
the people you go on discord with
no squid would be playing it on a smart window
to mot
something bad happen
there we will find the next step of the story
i nearly died
someone told me to go to sleep
allows you to take an aura like corrosive projection
zenurik is super strong energy regeneration
and now that you can hunt teralysts you also have arcane buffs to start collecting
as per usual
what's the challenge?
it’s cool that they gave a riven
gonna try to sleep now
like +30% strength
sounds fun
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
you say that like it's a good idea but then you realize steam games take a month to patch/download there
i think you mean a shit ton
assuming the butt is predominantly meat with a small layer of fat
guys
its so much easier
\:thinking\:
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
goood
flubs convince him
minus the "social" part
this is going to be like the old days of youtube when your only impressions were you and your mom isn't it
on every site
they can *do* that?
gonna go watchwestwing();}
i thought windows used ntfs
"well we've already shipped fifty million of the things, too late i guess"
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
how long is break time?
that's what "formatting" means right
break time
*breaks dra*- oh wait, he did it himself
all you have to do is dip a piece of paper in the septic tank and then take a picture of it with a really low-quality camera
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
now i want to google "corrosive font" and see what comes up
latin likes to play loose
i dont think this one has a right answer
rates of change and other not-exciting stuff
make what a thing
i don't blame them <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
byebye pins
i sent the prof an email about it too
mines on the top
(๑•͈ᴗb•͈)
and when you die it stops being your problem
is that good or bad
<:rooduck:399827506665881600>
im sleepy
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
it's all mems
as you know, fred
well it's actually more like a record label
i'm going to file that under "could be worse"
basically
woah
they're an emerging marketplace right now
that was master's bad idea not mine
actually
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated
yes yes yes yes
16,318,782
when i first watched they had 200k subs
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
i still don’t get why they are a thing
rc have you even _seen_ this guy's content
wack
i love the 18th century
bella they dont even have guns they arent the smartest folk
the one easiest to remember thats non dlc is the one with one of the guilds
yeah but how was i supposed to know that
but like how dont they have guns in skyrim
gouda?
thank you
wow they have analytics from the 20s?
sweden is a myth
of course interest in memes increase over the years
great, now i'm tempted to watch crash course videos for the rest of the night
`how not to set your pizza on fire: crash course engineering #15`
dragonite: 1; dragonite: 0
no notifications except for the guy who i'm trying very hard to avoid
ahoy
would you rather stick each individual sheet of paper in its own envelope and stick all of the envelopes in one big envelope
damn i want to do that now
oh yeah in dark brotherhood questline you murder the emperor while hes on his ship
virginia tech? yeah they sent me recruiting information well into my twenties also
thats probably how the fcc feels about public comments tho too
master know anyone who hates receiving letters?
also my nose runs
and saw some stuff
oh i forgot that i blocked mee6
indeed.  welcome to our little slice of discord.
my first class gives quizzes exactly at the start.. it sucks
take the easy option in this case
i love this
glad to see everyone doing well
they both are bad
those carts would make 5 year old me so excited
another essay due in english already <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
that sounds cruel and unusual
get the dynamite
oh yeah and we had a mini argumentative piece in gov that most people wrote over a page for. i wrote half a page talking out of my ass and got 6/6 on it
wow i made it
same for me
no thanks i just ate two slices of terrible pizza
sounds good
bella want some terrible pizza? the school cafeteria has more of it than they know what to do with
vote'); drop table candidates --;
it's cold therefore it's christmas
i remember we got papers or something about it in high school but i never read them
>implying there's anything else to talk about
maybe if you throw it fast enough you can knock out the power cord or something
this whole mornings real odd
then again
hey theres plenty other things to talk about
exactly
very badly
is the new 3ds worth?
but then it starts becoming unpredictable
for a certain time
ida battle drago pls and destroy him!
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
with or without the viking swords
even older
i did a really good typo earlier
wanna learn history?
and there are no paper cartridges
nothing im interested in
but you physically copies are nice for display
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
humans are nice
video games
post with a dog in it -> search by controversial
fun times for all

thanks
greetings all those who are kind
scrub
i can inv you
take out camera because its kinda funny
i still gotta do it to
and then i remembered there was a communications patch taht i havent updated on yet
actually i think they all are except access and onenote, and who uses access and onenote
hello person
oh and guess who cant sleep again
brb pretending to be productive today
it's windows
got it
> question 56
i did this problem last night
microsoft office
but if any math nerd can give me their input on that problem #56 *cough* master *cough* spazzer *cough* when you can that'd be great
or you could say a= -2/x
but is it differentiable?
me thinks problem is flawed
so the first piece and second piece should have the same derivative value at x = 0
makes sense
a friend and i were discussing nintendo's new paid online
nah, you should know
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
also i'm pretty sure a majority of people make over $41k
gum might get to study overseas
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
you arent allowed to touch the penguins
well if the context of the conversation is "hey dont plow our house down"
or maybe penguins can study gummyology
it's the study of motion basically
too late doing calc first
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
the classes are way tougher than film
majestic it isnt butter its a butter subsitute
gummy what do you _do_ with a film degree anyway
film editor or producer for tv shows before moving on to movies or animation
though it’s good that teacher’s programs aren’t easy.. literally teaching the next generation lmao
community moreso when you wanna transfer... those reqs are no joke
gummy wanna take my writing class for me
i already am complaining about college
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it’s the same thing
that’s awesome
those are _all_ true and false
ring theory is that if something is round and goes on a finger its probably a ring
final*
i took chem as a senior
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
i mean people in grade 12
i think the highest for freshman here is bio
im in such a good mood
no...i think ida was the one hat said she would create a game a something for it
well that’s easy
oh gummy _is_ the detention teacher
i’ll remind her
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
i should probably tag him hun
it's so cool and easy too
as long as you're careful, rock and roll
i was going to say
is that a good thing or a bad thing
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
you have no valid point
it’s normal probably
i'm watching re:zeri
because i do the dumb
a high male voice in choir
ida are you implying that you sleep well _normally?_
or maybe someday you could be a history prof
well, have fun
it’s not surprising, but official
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question
should have learnt french instead
i got chewed out in first grade
i have poems to read. hopefully
oh i hate teachers
@someone else, set it up to ping me whenever someone says gay
ccongrats
i still think nintendo should have their own site/system like loveroms and emuparadise with netflix style payments or something to play older games
leave'er johnny leaver ohh leaver johnny leavr. for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
i wanna be a teacher so i hate myself
and it's time for us to leave her
a special fuck you to the guy who looked right at me while i was downed vs the gustrag three in a nitain mission and didn't revive me
oh look it's ten pm and ive done nothing useful today
~~always bring plasmor~~
felix is hot tbh
legitimate question: what's wrong with using a ternary operator?
it's 2 am here
goof off in the computer lab by making a program to dispense random calvin and hobbes quotes when called.
you could give it all to me
you have no clue what i want do you?
the ones with the really fuckin annoying names
so is paint
ahh, freshmen
the yellow part not the 0.7k part
no im flubs
gummy you know you can just use an elgato for that right
ive seen it
what type of drug are you one

someone needed a lex prime reciever
the more the researches cost
we are
cause i still need that
almost all research is done, shadow clan
thanks
yeah. didn’t know that actually
none of that matters why the fuck would you put that in your resume to literally everything
also this is happening
ida let me introduce you to these things called "the biggest pages on facebook"
jupiter
me and my big mouth
3450 i think
but reddit steals from 4chan and twitter and twitter steals from reddit. and we all know to stay far far away from 4chan so where is the purest meme source?
let the chaos begin in three, two, one . . .
sitting is comfortable and rising is hard
rip i returned to stream gone
rise up stormcloaks
if it was easy everyone would do it
[crickets]
im retiring as of 5 hours ago
im coming out of retirement for one last slam
good
is it bad that i bought the skyrim ost almost four years ago and im still not tired of it
i just find the last part hilarious
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again
wifi located
unity's z fighting solution is reeeeeaaaaaally baaaaaaaaaaad
you can do that in real life too
i like it when my code is a metaphor for my entire life
"and here we have dragonite getting his eleventh hour of sleep"
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
also is it bad that nintendo sent me an email about a pokémon distribution and the pokémon in the picture was completely unrecognizable
the large one
good job
thats the boy
the forecast calls for an undefiend chance of dragonite showing up to stream tonight
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
snorlax
okay so that didnt go well
yeah, i should've known that joke would fall flat
actually it's from the enlightened# channel
we just have the tallest house on the block
@drag see subreddit
the who?
last i checked thanos helped us clear what was left of their spies out
the homeowner association subreddit?
i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
it's their 10 year anniversary but it all has to go under $25
should've used ragnar the red
and your grass height
no it would probably be the timestamp of the last time the page was edited
but how long will libraries actually stay open with the internet existing?
extreme cheap cake?
the discordie one sucks?
but it's halloween in a month
oh yes i just don't have mods revolting against me i also have a non mod wanting to take over my server and call it gummyland 2.0
it keeps fuckin changing
if the cobwebs arent fresh all the neighbors will laugh at us
yeah
but i must get enough money if i wanna see my gf
i assume that is good?
i will hire you to ban them
and slap this one girl at bronycon i hate
im watching sportsball
welp
#define define //
that...doesnt make sense
do it later
lies
it was in my photo album for too long, can finally free up that storage
okay then
and nitain
nah that sounds like work
good gravy i want to get stuff done but i have a cold and cant think straight
video games
how is that possible
if it wasn't "it sucked" im going to be disappointed
well
so the meta is really different at the different game difficulties
i was gonna get new york but they only had 12 oz
i almost always get some vegetables with steak orders
my mom has told me i should be a professional math test tester
yeah the cpp standard is like nope
looks like asparagus
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i have an essay to do
the revolution was the wii's code name

ida you forgot the sickle you fool that's only half a revolution
all of my freinds get a week off of school this week
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
1. [magnavox]
nerf swords.
9. switch
2. [2600]
thats more like an arcade game than a console
6. gcn
and why call it 2600 and not atari?
7. wii
they did.
it was basically the result of a severe lack of quality control back then
there was a gaming crash?
flubs follow me, we're getting you your trucker license
what letter
e!google magnavox nintendo
i misread demon lords statement by one letter
8. u
who was that
just get rid of the disease by taking in laxatives and stool hardeners
he's clearly pink
there's your magnavox.
he is green
my family went to disney world in spring of fourth grade and i was still tan when i graduated eighth
and the store page for 2k is still up on steam
i am so proud
why is it on the list?
greetings, animal\_man\_.
wait im dead?
i wonder
no meds no deal
im so confused
not sure what i should do
i'd put up some halloween decorations too but i dont remember what i did in previous years and i dont want to repeat anything
spooky
sounds scary enough for halloween
hmm i have a better idea
and then i noticed the riven has -101% projectile flight speed
with?
wait
no joke this time
for a bunch of prime trash
i got my feedback on my essay map
gummy i have no idea what youre talking about but good job
and the market is open so the premium currency is tradable as you want with other players
that sounds like work
warframe is good tho
too dark; can’t see the other wall. start over <:kappa:374346980136058893>
thats a wall
but you guys seem to be the type to know the answer to this
watch old vsauce vieos
how in the hell do i start learning programming
then you cry in the corner and question your life choices
you go on the google and look up snakes. they teach you codes
not doing any classes on it
it worked
mostly because there are no classes on it.
learning programming from a boom is like
ah yes
you can
okay
times this one by 20
fair enough
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
15 hours?
i mean skywind has a direct canon dovahzul translation, for one
> essay
but it's due monday
my friggin college calculus course is easier than my high school honors course
the great thing about physics is that you don't need words for it to make sense
and i was never told to start working on it, only that it was due monday
"here's a template lab that someone turned in in 2007, just copy and paste some words and add a table of your results and write me two sentences for why your results don't match mine and you get a 95"
the directions are equal to "ok go and do it have fun!"
yeah that's pretty much what's in all of the lab files i still have lmao
like spaghetti or people
my favorite part is when you catch the black hole at just the right angle and you can see an image of yourself without needing a mirror
also what the fuck how do teachers have enough time to grade all this stuff and still make tests and shit
oh and i got another essay in english due
alright cool
im eating vegetables
youll grow too powerful
me first
squid if you die i get your stuff
i know only of blitzypoo
youre welcome
yeah

no but that's a good idea
i dont see pictures and i thought for a second...

so lost my gf and a lot of people
i been noticing my mood changing quick
ghosts dont scare me they make me feel safe
batman the animated series
problem is idk how to get one
they way you say that makes it sound like not everyone on planet earth watched arthur
maybe a bone doctor or whatever theyre called
well she was the only one i knew who watched
nerds
do what is right for you countrymen
the cartoon
i don't know any demon lord
this is an insult to gummy
what?!
someone gets me
apparently i can’t man up and apologize
dragonite i know who is who dont worryu
maybe i have the song, you don't know xd
that *definitely* will help. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
doot
wait i think i have a spooky dan
no flubs

stahp
gummy take him gambling
so funny story i aimed for the "change avatar" button and almost clicked the "delete account button"
could be worse
it's like the cretaceous but with smaller dinosaurs
damn i was close
its gonna last hours too
sounds like a plan
i could get things done or i could play skyrim
well i am happy for some reason
while idk my relationship status with my gf i can safely confirm ida is the older sister i always wanted
~~well ida is ugly~~
then imagine all of the terrible things that you probably did to him except youre not allowed to return the favor
older sisters are hot in anime
jk jk
you can have my little sister
but i also looked up to him so that was nice
okay no wonder my peanut butter is wet
>: (
i realize something
i still have to redo the entire physics essay too <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
for now
and the ones for linux are . . . entertaining
it's always supposed to be raining somewhere
i could not find a single answer
other than that they expect me to find out really specific details that only websites like yahoo answers or quora seem to know
then at the end they had me describe two proposed methods of interstellar travel, and talk about the concept of warp drive which was probably honestly the easiest part becuase a lot of websites actually agreed ont he information
coffee sucks <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i could not agree more
ask them to double check that they didn't give you ap astronomy homework
dragonite happy
did the disable expiration spell break?
people who like coffee
i have one question
alright im back
and cowards
i just feel like this list is missing a few things
nice
wait did i fucking say that my knees are above the knees?
im in a computer lab now and dont feel like discording on my phone
oh so browser boy mode is alt

you can do ivara fine without lua
oh no we _do_ have visual studio
even tetris
never going back there
and a boat fishing mode
its true
believe it or not
the fun one is farming salmon eggs
sneaky pot
that sounded really really bad
ew, gas hasn’t been as high lately but i just saw one for 4.29
trains are nice
man life is so much calmer without thunder everywhere always
it only took an hour
can ice cream go bad? because i just found half a pint of ice cream from like a month ago in my freezer and i wanna eat it
theres no underwater infestation
it's like 3.10 here and people are rioting in the streets lmao
a liter is 5 billion gallons i think
incredibly
the sine of swuid is squid?
oh no
oh no dragonite is gonna yell at me again
flubs please refrain from doing pg-rated things with the bot
play the lottery on when my next song comes out
dont worry it is

however sucking is produced by a generated difference in pressure by removing matter from an area, causing pressure on other sides to push matter toward the vacuum

magic

what fpsing
i have physical frustration, sexual frustration material will help none
where's gummy?
but now it isnt but you cant say spooky or anything with the word spook in it
if so my faith in the fandom has been both destroyed and resurrected at the same time
oh i stopped watching it after the pancake fiasco
it feels great the day after next
you know what never mind i dont know if i want to know
theres not that many pink nu to choose from
<:gwpaboawesmart:407618728159608832>

smack dab on your paper

i was just surprised
saturn

i mean this wouldn't be the first time he's attempted to save something
getting laid is nice too tho

because i have some and want very desperately to be not sober
urgent question: is everclear safe to drink

i'm not
just in case
it's not because women are more emotional

said me*
i’m not down for this
and some lucky fellow's, at some point
i prefer standing tall in empty fields in thunderstorms

he doesn’t
have any idea?
where are the words and/or characters missing in the document?
though honestly, haven’t come across that problem
openoffice might not support the formatting used for the `dx/dt` and such.  i forget where exactly it is in word, but i can see that as something that isn't easy to translate over to openoffice/libreoffice.
i'd suggest just throwing it on google drive

ironic as they want to reduce language as much as possible in there
i wonder if adding copypasta to tech support tickets and then ignoring the replies on their site is also part of windows policy
also not putting ig first in d lul
did you get the windows update?
it probably has something to do with an unknown component near the back-lower-right of the computer tower spitting sparks at me the other day
idk if this should be here or memes but lo;
today im even more happier
they now legally have to unban you
great ida
gummy when did google shut you down
i will
i just have those correct button things on my phone
that pinged me
but now it will be gone
when i sub botted?
hey i know what i should do
and see if that subbot website still worls
i didnt play harvest moon
but he wants to gamble flubs
yeah but hes sleeping in my lap
itd be all jolty and hed wake up
but i dunno where she is
that usually holds me over for the rest of the month
yay windows
and you fucking *pay* to be busy
you mean there are people who _dont_ show their passport when asked for id
sorry to hear that
and if you continue youll be inclined to waste even _more_ of your time
so you say youtube videos are fun while streaming is a waste of time while ida says youtube videos are a waste of time but streaming is fun
rip ida
if you want to be a full time streamer prepare to literally never have more than one or two days off
master do you even know the words to ragnar the red
also you can't argue with your viewers
that depends on the streamer
actually a lot of siege streamers dont put up with people being douches in chat and i find it really funny
since if you just ban every person who insults you you're going to have no viewers left
kix once banned someone for copy pasting a question over and over until someone answered. it was great
i stream because im bored
yeah i agree
also a lot of siege streamers employ mob justice which i just love. if maciejay wants to ban someone for something petty he'll open it to chat. i dont think theyve ever survived mob justice
i just need 15 more followers and that 3 average views
well thats incorrect
people are sleeping on ig tbh

honestly, watching an lp of it, i do like some of the story and character stuff. but, i’m still not going to play it myself
but gf had an unexpected bill
no because i dont expect this back
do you want to tell him or
it's my gf flubs
i mean he does get usage of a twitch emote in return for subbing
so gummy why couldnt she afford whatever the fuck
if she doesn't pay me back you can tell me i told you so
i guess we will see what happens in the future

i guess he wasnt very thoreau when it came to getting his point across
god i hate myself. theres no turning it off
im sorry
keep being you

its correct.. but at what cost
just code triple battles and then copy paste it but subtract 1
or maybe pokémon battle royale
i don't remember what it is but i know i played it before 14 days of shitstorm

good afternoon
not even close.
so isn’t amaratsu a dog or a fox?
i’m so glad there’s no quiz on thoreau.. so i didn’t totally waste my time reading 50+ pages. that would’ve sucked
i probably killed the spelling. my apologies
amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, taking the form of a wolf.
i had a strange feeling you were gonna be easy to get along with
so i need to understand that others do the exact same thing.
i’m going to give you my honest opinions on whatever the subject is. that’s just me. so i hope that doesn’t interfere in future convos that we may have in the future
sound reasonable to me.
so now that we got that squared away. are you into makoto shinkai movies?
youtube is my primary source of entertainment.
only if you want no ads and offline viewing on the mobile app, but there are gif cards that are only sold at best buy and gamestop if you don’t wanna use a credit card
gift*
no, as in how frequently do the ads show up.
you mean they pricing?
do you see it?
yup.
on cn
i remember i caught half of one episode and never saw it again.

class is only an hour and a half long but i don’t wanna go
sadly
i'm sleepy

i would go on more but class is starting
i want whoever told me that fired
when did you apply
you ran—oh that dragonite
what did you guys blow up today?
my resume is literally a text file with four-space tabs thats a good way to get a job right
ddmmyyyy is little endian
oh right
i typically always see/write month first
no the others are stupid because why should i change the way i write the date
who the fuck makes long term investments
how is month first stupid
i’m surprised year first is actually a thing
it is in canada
i mean whats the point of life if you dont get to invoke a little society-sized catastrophe now and again
they were sitting around 32-33 dollars a share a few weeks ago now theyre at like
do i ask what that is
base twelve would be awesome
oh also they make like computer guts and stuff
its the execution that gets you in trouble
also theres nothing illegal about *wanting* to pour boiling hot water down someones throat
yeah

what is the work
you aren’t
just so yall know im aqua
not bad
i hate it there
is that good or bad
cccccccccccccccc

maybe it's a toy car
bella youre an octopie
octopie
it's an acquired skill
so we just played against trick2g
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
very kind of you

yeah, it's the one that melts your face off
i'm genuinely curious what she would think in different scenarios

boys in blue did it
twilight princess link - - in ocarina of time! ^^^^^^^

i shall be spending my weekend watching these vods
lul, how are the peoples of zeal today
got damn it
why do people out smart me?
con: youre a villain so you had to kill it
could go for some more pizza tho
benny ate it while gummy was watching him
i’ll also take some pizza, thank you
speaking of newton
i like integrals and pizza
proofs and theorem derivations are great tho
it's basically an approximation that gets better and better and you can write it out to a greater accuracy than your calc
plus im not positive that newton's method can approximate all points
windows wants to update and is giving me the option to do it either now or now
like the sixth root of 2 for example
so  after getting x_n+1 you'd use that as x_n on the right side and get a new better x_n+1 and keept hat cycle over and over
skarm say brb
yay windows
*throws waffle out the squid that was* etc.

i assume you meant follow
following does nothing though
actually the animation is very similar to anime
tbh i never actually care about converting people to bronies just for jokes but i still converted someone
this reminds me of the time my roommate ate 24 ounces of parmesan cheese in three days
also is it bad
unless you seem my anger issues
talking to me is great ida
speaking of warlike and destructive, you would make a great fit for eimm
good thing i left that server when i did

i'm so lonely
kick/ban
you just fuckin called me dan

no do exactly that
again?
~~i just assume everyone who isn’t here at the time is out actually doing something with their lives~~

and it's autumn
i actually like the autumn one a lot
that's the full image
nice, you updated these on stream too then?
granted twitch makes it hard because they always change their damn rules when it comes to how images fall below the stream
love the new icon 💗
i want to do some housecleaning on this server too, but that's another day's project
again, another day's project
5 minutes maybe
a week it is then
hey guys how long has the server picture been different without me noticing
it's never on it
that last one has been that way for a month now
even if his best if fuckin trash
is that the protonjon head with dragonite antennae
no cupcake for you come to stream
my guess would be homestuck or something.
they have two prongs instead of just the one

welp
my dog has bigger spots on her right side than on her left side
it's called blue steak
thanks
he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
kugal ive been in that situation and the person is never fuckin worth it. also they usually dont even learn
exactly, theyre always annoying self-centered asses
not typically, no, not safe
kugal right click on the guy
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
thats fair
kugal tell him that this is your alt account and point him to me as your main one
i feel like with all the diversity there is on the internet, ,there's bound to be one person who says that seriously
so when he shows me his screen and what he needs help with, everything is in german
im gonna get too depressed
he's been offline for a few hours, so its been pretty peaceful
r value is 1-1e-12
and part of me doesnt want to because i still have to see him in class everyday and i dont want him to give me shit for blocking him
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
3 day weekend for me
that works too
thats not dickish at all
the last day of that class was awesome
i dont know why but i guess i dont have the heart to block because i feel guilty i guess
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
the only thing i like/miss from high school is being with the handful of people i actually liked
well, int hat class anyway
oh shit that reminds me
thats dumb
not the one i expected you to pin
ive reached the point where i believe theres some bottomless box of emotes but how do you find the ones you need
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time
or just relevant ones.
for one
we did it
ok then i dont which is good
dern
would you like me to create another dab
birthday punch!
it's today
is that like an off brand falcon punch?
master how long has my quote about being a dumbass been pinned
candy is secondary
<:gwqlabsmonkass:393085114403389442>

shu todoroki from cars 2

i just finished the second episode of telltales the walking dead’s final season and i’m bummed now
you guys and your spreadsheets rub off on me too much
also archwing launcher is infinite now
cloud 9 bany
he literally drank whisky from the bottle while driving
im no bandwagoner
okay
i love tsm but they tend to not play there own style and play scare hoping they can somehow win late game
people won’t make fun of c9 for getting an “easy” group or skt carrying them out
also gummy sure we can collab, you can be the punching bag
play both at the same time
and which one
we both dressed up as the scariest thing we can think of
your costume, however, is remarkable
after halloween
i just got demoted from silver 4 and my first game after that i go 4/0/21 on braum
im watching gordan ramsay cooking steak on a shovel
i hate things right now *throws squid out of the pumpkin patch*
i wish
also why is the w in my name lower case?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
but i like flubs ill take gummy instead
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
how dare you blame me?
by all means, kill gummy all you want but i'll still know, and i'd be the winner here
drinking water is fun
but i can already use fly
shit
you are a boat
im pretty sure i can use hm03 too
fuck
tm94
let me look this up
he would get to battle the fat kid
is that sun and moon or x and y or black and white
sun and moon
sup pals
now i only have 6 courses to worry about
r i s e
because you can never know for sure if they *arent* poisonous, but if you learn that they are you know
i've read a few *comics* about that
so do some people
the fuck is a district
flubs why is everyone living in the place most vulnerable to hurricanes
some places overlap too its great
its a piece of a state that has a senator
when i was a kid my next door neighbor had a different zip code and phone area code
great now i spent 12 minutes reading about nassau the island instead of finishing homework
oh cool apparently the sound had d+ water ecosystem health when i was a kid
league of legends but you jump upwards the whole time?
its got all the good restaurants in the sound
would be interesting to have an item with a tooltip comment of all the people who actually did someting incredibly against the odds like get perfect pickems
master my code isnt working help
greetings, bellas.
use your magic to cancel my classes too
figured i should mention today's my birthday.
happy birthday!!
greetings.
happy womb escape day
definitely not one of us
no you could have tell it was him
gummy i am disgusted at the implication
lets blame it on eyan
how much man card debt is he in rn?
nice
but any sane person would tell you that when you're paying five figures to enroll, you'd damn well better be getting more out of it than something you could do on the internet for free
thankfully not
thermodynamics in gases?
it was way different from my high school
if i’m teaching myself why do i even go here
wonder if they could rally together in name of my sad sad grade
i half-ass both
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
i want to understand things i don't understand, but then i would understand why people are dumb. but then again that's self explanatory. screw that
open it
and then make the boxes into a *larger* box
well gee sorry im having christmas early <:kappa:374346980136058893>
that includes pens, pencils, pencil lead, a notebook, some note flags, and i got 2 things that werent school related
thats ok i got 11 left lul
~~yeah, just ignore that last message of mine~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
just join him and he'll eventually stop
thinkinator always helps
four little slices of salami rolled up with enough horseradish inside to make me not hungry
gummy wanna write my code for me
is it hard to use a keyboard with panda hands though
gummy if i went to bronycon i might only come out on my way to the coroner
sorta
like this time i literally need protection
this doesnt help it hinders at best
also gummy ill be your bodyguard if i get to wear dark sunglasses and an im with stupid shirt
god what the fuck why do people always say put ice on bruises and shit
then how would anyone know
according to healthline.com, cooling the blood vessels can reduce the amount of blood that leaks into the surrounding tissue, which can prevent the bruise from being as apparent and reduce swelling.
doesnt change the fact that i faceplanted into a fucking staircase on my way to work does it
ice is bs i say we revoke all ice funding and run their business into the ground
is that a politics joke
you go ahead, i'm just going to save ice complaints for winter anyway
wats dat?
you have many choices in your play-style and character customization but i always stick with what i’m comfortable with
since i played skyrim
flubs i didnt know you were into thermodynamics
i dont even fucking know what that is
the law of conservation of momentum is what keeps dragonite's butt in a chair all day
im making a sick 3d model
yeah and also
i learnt yesterday ida edits better than me
if they can't adapt, they deserve to lose
how about this
that barely helps
if you even have to ask
draco im reporting you to the humane society
aight then we good
just listen to your body,if you pinched a blood vessel by sitting wrong your vision could easily go dark for an extreme amount of time without any repercussions
hours
ooh look im rainy im functional
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
yeah, human body is weird, freak incidents/outliers should be taken seriously, but not as pure factual indicators
i just have a compulsion when it comes to those red squiggles
how do you spell the word for "assure" that sounds like garrin-tiid i k ow it has a lot of unnecessary us and as and es
that sounds like an organ
alright tell me now
no me
bai rainy <:roocry:399827523011084298>
dragonite pick a language
i just realized i've watched chugga for ~half my life
the dent is because my skull didnt fuse right when i was a baby
my mom is an emoji
lemme check
my head hurts from looking at a screen all day or something im going to go to bed or something
cannot beat legends never die
outside probably closer to 3
it’s hitting 3 degrees where i am
disappointed but not surprised
huh. the more i like flash’s s5 suit the more i like it
unless 100 thieves make it out which probably not c9 is last hope
i am proffessjonal analist
my history professor is amazing
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i put on a vr headset once and it was like
yeah it’s a lot to deal with.
but there are some that do a good job about it.
budget cuts for eample.
i just finished the little game thing and immediately had to get out
hello
you'll keep it
that is the question
fair enough
history teacher made a debate room in class
what does sleeve mean in this context
i went in and said "pineapples dont have sleeves, change my mind"
people got even more confused
today i learn you don’t get 6 tattoos of the person you love and that you shouldn’t propose after one month of datig
i thought she was one of the normal-ish ones
im surprise ida knows who that is
could you wait like 20 years to move in with each other first then
me and her made a rule
don’t you wanna come to the wedding?
stupid traditions
i hate them
its in the name though
like there's so many other things you can use that money for
do you want to be married?
so yes you can
screw call of duty
there is nothing innovative or new about it. i might as well play a less buggy, lower netcode pubg with powerups
and they have a low level of entry but high skill ceiling
but dual wielded
vortex is dead
i don’t know any decent person <:kappa:374346980136058893>
maybe i should lol
putting 10 on any intern
and i was on a podcast with a guy who has 60k subs. not sure how many people watched it; he doesn’t get many people watching his videos anymore
but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
return my vision and you can have one
which im immune to
and theyre hazy as fuck even with my glasses on
nobody at work knows tho
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
i'm alive
<:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
it could potentially be c9 vs fnc in semis
i didnt diss it
-10 what
stick an ie in there somewhere
never go stormrazor its shit on her
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt
today was interesting
yep, that's how uni is
oh wait ida did i tell you i got that one day job selling flowers?
wait i heard keyboard
though impressive
tbh i haven’t seen any college kid smoke
i have never seen this game in my life so i don’t want to ask what it is
i believe in the boys in blue
and there’s videos on the side on his phone he’s not even watching
i believe in fnatic
mad shit the bed
oh well fnatic is from eu
but edg seems stronger than c9
don't believe in kt if you want them to win
oh god, there’s a chance for snow a little north from here 😑
its not
well i want c9 to win
jensen is still one of the best western mids
ninja or samurai?
that answers nothing
am i jealous or envious
~~you want to be that twitch streamer?~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i saw the previews and i am very ready for it
im just...?
comic book plotline?
im still assuming nga is roy
very slight but very much liked
i need to study for my midterm...
the fuck is a syllabus?
theeen thats youre fault (:
5 mins before exam
it’s my parents
like super super hard
i want you to be super hard on me
not like that master...
you should get caught up on storyline
you know is it bad that im still not done my essay due last monday
get to it then
so, thisll be fun
you know that won’t work this time
i have to remember how to classify plants that i was totally listening to last week
yeah
guys i think i hate xml.
i think so
i knew it
when does supper happen then
and flubs you would not like this person
gummy is that how you go around meeting new people
"hello my name is gummy, do you like the emoji movie?"
ask for shows
probably not
now just gotta find an irl flubs
whatever you are but in irl
you can do that
then my life is complete
im not even sure what i am
i don’t remember if i even registered to vote
what's this about my toaster
schools overcharge, hooray
i can get a slice of pizza at school for 2.65 but it doesnt taste very good
i don’t want to say specifically for spoilers but oh my god
she dies
why would that be exciting for me lol
there’s only a couple shows where that’s ok
its a special arrangement of only the finest ~~volatile death orbs~~ vitamin rich frenchless unfrieds
just say potatoes for gummy and theyll know
you should go look at it youll be even more disappointed in me than before
im back with potatoes
dang
well yeah. its cod. thats to be expected. shitty, but expected
gimme the potoat
dont bully me ill tell mom
so far your friend’s not bad
errr nooo
also bella dare i ask why you said "burgers," plural?
fight my enemies yes
it’s not good to have lol
i’ve already probably had way too much sugar... may opt out on the soda
considering i don’t think you’ve had this chain before i’d be ok with that
thanks
(this is totally not based off of a stackoverflow question i saw a little while ago)
i’m an east coast boi because i live here and don’t travel
but it has magfest so it's all okay
i'm right on the edge basically
i haven’t even seen 2/3 of my own state <:lul:305559915714576385>
that's because california is weird
dragonite you're always playing skyrim even when you're not
how sweet
burgers for dinner is good
what do you even have left in skyrim?
that it is
and if i flirt with her punch me hard
gummy how could you
time stops love
yes you are
but still there are differences
drago likes everything i like
flubs hates everything
you 3 all hate everything
ultimate power move. it shows you think less of her than she thinks of you, that you definitely saw the gift, and dont care about her gift or need the balls
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
hmm i dont feel like working on game but i dont feel like nto working on game help
flubs ruin my day pls
your dog is dead
time to buy prime junk
first and only day for my new job and i crushed my knees getting there
i need like 3-4 of those
did it feel like you knew what you were doing?
or did you feel like batman?
instead of saying like 6200 ft² per second i accidentally said in my head 6200 ft / s² and thought that was ok
flubs
but the littlest part of me is expecting like 13/20 or something
we're only  touching a tiny bit on integration but im like amazing at integration, so that's little worry to me
damn
because i dont fully understand them
and don’t tell me i just started about 18 minutes ago
since we're still in q1 here
no cussing young man
go to your room
alright i got the two most important ones
oh wait vulkar wraith is
im honestly thinking about it
i do not insist
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
no job does not consist mainly of doing nothing. just look busy and you wont get more work
wanna hear a joke?
my love life
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
no just like both of them
i didnt say marry both
i just realized the ck logo and bethesda logo are basically the same thing
gummy youre officially looking for trouble and i'm hereby granting permission to interpret everything that you say as a rumination on cheese
as a general rule if your message was successfully submitted to a server and it later disappears, the solution is not "post it again"
after getting 4 fucking systems in a row
aight
im not looking for trouble
i don’t want it to work like that
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
especially with our bodies
usually, though
i feel like im cheating
i took a detour to the university
i just thought they were both spelled the same
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i can kinda see that
i might be able to, but not quite right now
sorry
i think i still used my lato at the time
i was using lex prime
market
hello there
join gummy in this week college adventure
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
welcome
and 4 of those papers you have to write 3-4 drafts including the final draft so rip lol
i guess i should think about doing something with my life now huh
greetings, squid.
well from my perspective, a full time job may help since it's more consistent in terms of hours.  though i'm not certain.
i already have too many large games to get through as it stands.
i fell asleep at 6 last night
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
i couldn’t stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
what does that mean
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
and you don’t have it on your switch or pager or rock
whenever i press a on a door nothing happens
at most
there's not only just one first seed left after quarterfinals
but i don't think they have a huge advantage
g2 was weaker
if they have anything cheesy prepared
afs probably knows about it
since
play skyrim
i have become crazy
you’ve been crazy
just return it
well
bluej
so basically if i do end up with this new girl she is cool that we breakup
since im in a good mood
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
maybe a shiba
im going to go pet my dog brb
dragonite what flavor of dog do you have
wanna see?
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
theoretically it would still work, you would just wish it didn't because the game would be so not fun
most bittersweet shit ever lmao
next question
20 or 40?
im in
k back
welp there goes 10k focus
ya'll need more zeal weekly in your lives
asking for a friend
ooh spicy
rip zeal wheel: he had a short life
ok mr freeze
wow master chill out
i can't do it to drago but i forced gummy's
ida you are the best big sister a gum could have ❤
took care of dragon
pfft this is scarier
i would give up on league but eh
i can’t give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>
fucking ask her
(the thing the kass did was accuse me and my duo of being toxic when we'd barely used the chat and he'd flamed my duo for the entire game)
also now my name is terrifying
which, to be fair
i will have a talk with him
52 lp
isn't saying much
lolwut
did i miss something
or background checks
as i am a paranoid person
:🇺 ➕ 🇲 🇪 ➡ 🍆
agrewd
wanna play my games but ehhhh
i forget the name of the splash one
can't take away a whole pc <:kappa:374346980136058893>
well ye
also i thought the same thing but guess what? you dont need to be good with computers to throw it out of a third story window
but my mom is bad w computers so i'm gokd
"can i pronounce its name?"
and
i realize something
this is the first time i feel irl love
provolone is pretty good, yes
haha time to make fun of a movie
hey no making fun of dwayne "the rock" "the toothfairy" "the lifeguard" "the adventurer" "the tamer" johnson
now, i speedrun games ye?
i found 36 ds and 45 gameboy advanced/color games in a box of my old stuff
he's a legend
obs studio for pc. if anything else, you’re screwed <:kappa:374346980136058893>
can't find the account though
so more i go to get
guys i did something really stupid
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo
fuck yeah
good for you both
i love arthur
it’s the stupid booming ones too
your grandma's a command prompt
are the dodgers in the playoffs or something
or they just won something
im not currently but now i want to know the answer
magic
thanks im going to get a second opinion on that
hmm ashbot's profile picture is upside-down ash
i hope it's still on da somewhere
okay so uh
no u
thats probably because i reconnected him
he's not upside down youre upside down
gross
they hacking
a really big number like ten to the six
when did it become 10
you are arent you
i fucking love licorice
licorice
fuck tsm
not bandwagoning
from the start
g2 took out rng so they're not a lightweight either
wtf fnatic
oh yea definitely no clear winner
anyone can win
~~now you gotta promise to buy c9 skins if they win worlds~~
i liked my blue
whos aqua
~~aqua is now magma.~~
noooo eu scrub!
they bad?
that tells me nothing
5/6 finish in summer
compared to before yeah they blow
i was summing it up for ida
of course they aren't bad
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
i wonder how long i can avoid being social and work in game today.
the other had a very close series that could have gone either way.
and in the end, even though 100t lost that series against tsm, they were overall much more consistent.
meteos was just a big misunderstanding
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
you be social
long term it may be a better move
could make sense though
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
remember what happen to dl on clg
true
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
i'm not at home rn, gotta do homework later
you don't know that
maybe during stream once it gets rolling
well i think ssumday won't stay
no reason for him to
flubs
its your brother
i don’t have a brother
or you could be neither
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
don't look away kugal that number will be orders more the second you check back in on it
i have like 3.50 on my desk in loose change that you can borrow
i’m back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming
you should probably copy and paste all those as a new e!suggest after getting that important one
6 runs of derelict survival
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
gonna do one more run for the night
also maple syrup your username is 10/10
im leaning towards skyrim
i believe in you
in a group of like 6 students, i know thats small
my profs don’t even let you see questions you missed if you didn’t get to class early enough
yeah like at least 1.5
one just said forget it to the actual assignments lmao
the only thing i dont really like much about the class is how some questions we are tested on but arent explained how to do them properly
though sometimes he's cool on some of the stuff that usually gets me
i just kinda wish my midterm would get graded already so i can see the horrible score i know i got
don’t sell yourself short, especially about math. that’s your bread and butter (:
like if i dont show my work in the best way he usually wont care, as long as i came to the right conclusion and he knows its my honest work i get full credit
i have such a bad problem with self confidence
i probably didnt score as high as i usually do, but probably not as low as how my toxic mind thought i would
i haven't played skyrim in like a day and a half
i havent played skyrim in like ever
but should i really?
meet me behind the big trash cans at 2:30
bring an xbox controller
urgh i really do want to play skyrim
god i can't believe i actually referenced a meme i am ashamed of myself
half of my monitors go with me to the soul stone
that still leaves like four or five of them right
and i wouldn't have met you guys
dragonite balances out the pros and cons of this but ehh worth
you too
he has accepted the truth
i remember microsoft flubs
lmao microsoft is still making tts voices
so that fucking joey with 100 metapods doesnt beat you by running you dry on pp
weekly ayatan
i need to dump some cause im at 14/15 rn
the most versatile early game hm keeper in gen 4?
still no octavia
wait im poor
i use carrier
dragonite's just a dork
i mean yeah if i choose arceus or dialga or something i'd just look like an egomaniac
or you stop to scan?
it yelled at me about for loops and turning x degrees already too
wait a minute what is that
hows this for cs homework
that's an amazing username.
unlike computer science, other tasks can be achieved faster as a group effort.
that or basically anything wonka
in practice the above is false
oh look they have that on a tee shirt i should get one
skittles are basically a substitute for oxygen right
the colors are all weird
i should do that
12 runs
i figured it out
okay okay
there's no increased odds for anything later on
and it's been 5 minutes
i'm doing osha training in class and this man just did it to em
me or gummy or both
i feel like i should know this but i only ever got the vaccinations that are necessary to not die
these are closely guarded doctoring secrets
so how the fuck do i get them
is that a good thing or a bad thing
normally yes but when it's you they're smiling at one should probably start worrying for their sanity
and smelled like perfume
trust me i am good at this
top ten things said before disaster
he will not
still upset i lost a fork
your opinion is wrong
that sounds like a euphemism for something to do with the toilet doesn't it
like not the first one
but on the front page
not the first server i saw this in
i got a fiora bug fixed by getting on the front page of r/lol once

he has a lot of money
today
the smoke detector just went off and dragonite's dog.exe has stopped working
theyre still not part of the game's files though
you dont hear anyone going "dear ideal masters ill trade you this dark soul gem for a spicy alchemy buff"
incantations are probabaly part of summoning
id think they had some other stuff that they made but it was dependent on their own water system. and due to water redirecting post disappearance only crimson nirnroot survived
ive heard good things about mushrooms
they were probably really bad at it where they live like the only thing you can use is chaurus eggs and glowing  mushrooms and i cant imagine either of those things taste very good
hey man dont judge the dwarves on their cooking techniques
so did the dwarves get yote or just kinda fuck off and stop existing?
who knows maybe they evolved to metabolize bronze or something
thanks
that is not a chaurus
go back to skyrim
it’s the first game i’m actually downloading on steam since i installed it a few days ago
i should probably do that
depends on the topic
well that was a failure.  neexxtt
im not an expert in this field
next question
play skyrim for the 1,000th time
that's an uncharacteristically good idea
is dragonite awake _before 10:30 for once?_
plot twist: you're actually not
daniel gheesling
took a nice nap and now my throat feels like a swarm of infestation
god damnit

dan is a good boy who makes good streams. and when he wants to be hes a fucking manipulative mastermind
it says infinity servings which is amazing
/r/softwaregore?
tic tacs
nice
in other news the wikipedia page of "list of numbers" is pretty good too
i know right
might i recommend pirating? its 100% fortnite free
this is non-negotiable
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
ok good
the latter
thats too salty for a reply. people need to prep for that level of salt
do you know if shes writing it rn?
5 pages on if weed should be leagal
play it safe and ask in the morning. people interrupting your mindflow is punishable by death
think it would be safer if i asked an hour later?
not a procrastinator
actually kinda
but she sat down and talked for another hour
best wingman ever
youtube shut up im not voting for any of them stop telling me who to vote for
and i thought flubs would talk about the inappropriate stuff again
bendy and the ink machine is scary game
have you ever played the game?

the office is great
i miss the office. probably going to rewatch it
i need to watch it first
and i thought i was fast
self control, good job
that isnt fast gummy. you need to up your game
and i thought i was early
hey i told you my uni friend did her hair and got dressed in 5 mins before class
my hair is too messy
imma go see the last of bendy and the ink machine, for some reason

god no
but i had to try
visiting me?
yeah i ate a baby
work?
take a pic of him
i'll tell you but i highly recommend you never listen to it
why does that sound familiar
i legit would get mad if someone around me sang that
but it also doesnt
this si awful
i just looked the lyrics up
but seriously batman and robin is better than the dark knight
anyone who disagrees can fight me
mannnn i am so effing pissed with this banner leak guy and the smash community right now
i mean eyan is streaming
maybe
i'm pissed btw since sakurai won't get the satisfaction of revealing these characters now because of this leaker showing off all of the remaining characters
but anyway my rant is over now
and the surprise has been ruined for unfortunate folks like me who saw the leak
if it wasnt intended
making sure you're the right guy here btw, is that you flubs?
streams almost done
welcome!
hey will
other people don't want to be spoiled!
since you don't care about leaks....
i agree with bella
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
just move duh
the wifi isn't out
wasn't even working on the wired computer
i think wired is as close as you can get
hello kugals
i did
i hate phone typing
big enough where i don't fuck up and press another button
how do they fit them all tho
no it was my old flipphone
is that a smart phone??
i only used it for 2 things
no... is that a technical smart phone??
i hate touchpads...
i keep pressing the wrong button
better than skype
well its sketchy as shit
i uninstalled skype
but who gives a fuck its easy to use
i must know these laws
oh that
like how you cant mass delete messages or when your account is removed your messages remain with your name on them
still better than skype
i sort of understand that, my hands were really shaking after playing on my ps3 for a while
the only thing i have left that's not a surprise is the blurred out mode
i have to actually look at what i'm typing if i have to use a touchpad
if it's subspace 2
it isnt even about cold i just have a weird feeling in my hands and wish for it to not be so annoying. if i wear gloves i dont have to put as much pressure on my fingertips
hi back *again*
i couldn't focus on stream for the majority of stream <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
gummy is mad at me becuase i had to go use the *lab*
im very confused
calling the bathroom "the little boy's room"
i remember that
the what now
nice work gum
yea he said he had tog o
well, idk
i was confused at first with your typing xp
that one calculator tool i showed you
oooh
i changed my degree to web design
nice
im great at saving money gum
i dont really care for it
for what classes you need for your degree
good point
mannnn i am so effing jealous again of the people who haven't been spoiled yet
<:roocomfy:399827521253670912>
see ya wolverale
always
make peace
brb pals
especially if you still interact witht he person after the fact
i can't spell
alright lol
you have committed crimes against skyrim and her people
my dad is the thane
some time in the mines should straighten you out
did someone steal his sweetroll?
tell me what he said so i can say it too
the forsworn are nice they have cookies and only try to kill you on some days
but i figured out what the joke was gonna be
i didn't knock anything off my to-do list today and i just want to go play skyrim instead
woo 100 on stat test
that is not a skill in skyrim why would you have a 100 on it
i learnt from a movie
nvm gf does not deserve it
good job gum
because it's like
idk how females work
no thats me
kugal be quiet you're like fourteen
that isnt how females work gummy its how people work
demon lord stop being old
i just realized i'm only 5 years away from 30
hey sis wanna move in with me for a day?
im 20 *and a half*
no that's down the hall and to the right
i am depressed
hi depressed nice to meet you
understandable
my god
that’s how i was until 2016
in skyrim's epilogue odahviing pronounces his own name wrong
oh - dah - ving
flubs
that did not age well.
instead of od - ah - viing like every other npc and the call dragon shout pronounces it
i didnt share most of the romance ones
i see someone with a username called gummy. i saw someone like that earlier on some anime server.
welcome \:)
thats lord gummy to you
lies
no stick pls
last time it was scary
hop to
what was the snapchat of
hmm i should probably get my butt over to stream shouldn't i
we all know dragonite's entire promotional email is about toilets and skyrim toilet mods
what the fuck happened to the earlier messages?

thats going in the sub
nah thats just an everyday occurrence
that was a fun stream
me me me!
i can't really blame you
that was four and a half hours ago now
but the game still allots time for it so it makes some of the animations kinda weird
(also if a spider makes it next to me i just turn to face the wall and accept my death)
the normal chaurus remind me of chaurus reapers
night at 5 am
im in bed before my sis
guess whose monitor broke the night she needs it
gummy don't break ida's monitor
hmm alduin is 50% resistant to fire
on the plus side the number of magicka potions i used in that span probably cleared up at least a hundred pounds of carry weight in my inventory by the end of the game
or are we talking about ida
i’m just lazy and did an all in one kind of character
congratulations gummy you act at least ten years younger than you are
my classes hardly have gotten cancelled this semester and i don’t approve
anyways since my two dating advisors bunni and flubs aren’t on
blitzypoo is next in line
i don't know dating
okay blitz how long do i have to know someone before asking them out?
okay...
i like sleep but i also wanna work on battle ai
girl is super cute
first that gives you time to see if you actually like them
set her on fire then she'll be hot
kugal don't encourage my stupid
thats the best
just tell her "good, i eat enough meat for both of us"
pfft
you can always date yourself
kugal he said _smart_
the females only have bad luck though because you keep trying to talk to them
no drago
did you break it
yeah i'm surprised there's that many too
interesting
it happens
i keep asking gummy but he keeps changing the subject for some odd reason
either or
amen to that one
panda's here who wants to talk about butts
i'm not either but it makes my inner seven-year-old giggle
<:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
i can hook drago up with a girl
yes she is legal to smoke it
see ya drago
night drago
set who up with me now
first question
how old is she
she is 19
i mean i did the age test
i wouldn't exactly call it a test.
it's more of an algorithm
hey my ex gf who thinks she’s from another world is 22
also did i say i was going to sleep? i lied i got distracted by reddit
but jesus that reminds me im gonna be 17 in like a couple of months
what other girl gum
you and her go out
(oh she is gonna kill me tomorrow)
i think she deserves someone ten times better than me
why are you trying to set me up with people in the server lmao
because idk any other females
i can always date myself
of course it isnt
im gonna invent it for the lonely and desperate though
my parents want the opposite
everyone wins
oh dear a student is bothering me about school stuff
why is he asking me about shit thats past due
does that help
i should probably get to bed if i want to get up in 6 hours
plot twist i never slept
good job?
~~sleep is for the weak and squid~~
yes no maybe so
is the twitter-removing-the-like-button thing real or did i forget to wake up this morning
that’s not the reason you should have to dislike this happening...
so anyway, i drove a half hour to class, only to find out that class was cancelled
guess who got an email saying that class was cancelled!
why didnt dragonite see said email?
thanks teacher
i was wondering if your client didn't sync or something.
either my teacher's email account is magically broken and it's the only one because i"m still getting every single other piece of spam that the school sends out to every single student, or my teacher didn't send an email
oops didn't see you there
why did you run over that squid? someone could’ve eaten it
i should probably record something
but skyrim sure is alluring isn't it
i recorded stuff earlier. need to edit it sometime
my desk drawer is jammed shut and that's where i keep my wii remotes
needs more letterboxing
go back to bed
#getidaoutside
so sad. i already miss its weird screeching and rubbing sounds
shit i needed ida since idk how to food shop
just buy food
maybe revise that sentence
roll and talk with me
buy food to make into food dont buy instant shit
its better for you and prolly cost less
instant coffee
sorry squid. had instant mashed potatoes and i never will again
is it even that good for you
well i eat like what the soldiers ate in the 18th/19th century
is what good for you
it just tastes like dirt
wow draco that one hurts
if that happens and it goes big that would actually increase my viewership
honestly
i don't see anything wrong with it
and i loved it
why did i quit...
i should ask /r/letsplay and theyll be like "how dare you dont make content thats interesting enough to not leave spam on"
i have notifications turned off
both on pc and phone
provolone is pretty good but mozzarella is better
great news
flubs front and center
because youtube hates me
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
becaues that'll take forever
anyone good in physics mind giving me some insight to this problem, there's gotta be a simpler way to solve it than the way i did
for some reason
yeah idk why
one of my programming teachers told me i failed the midterm because i answered all six qurstions instead of choosing five
i know that, deci
silly dragonite its not the pastime its the career
guys
holy crap
nick valentine has the same voice actor as belethor and a bunch of other minor skyrim characters
he also does other shit too
gummy
<:yea:327308337722949642>
dont do that its bad
we aren’t doing sibling bonding time tomorrow!
flubs no
well guys im going for it
yes i got my advice from a guy in the military
taste great
ok, time for sleep. don’t burn the place down; i want to be awake to see it
no promises
okay, so where you do want me to put this lighter fluid at?
honestly i think a lot of people would stay in the server if they were greeted by a bot calling them a fuckwad and saying he was gonna murder them
it breathes a certain air of positivity i think the world could really use
its so very fair and balanced that he gets a free soul charge
anyway, i can chill and sleep finally
you should do a histiry essay on tbe history of history essays
i would totally do that
im curious now
so basically the whole ordeal
his excuse was that he has bipolar disorder
anyway i really should do the whole sleep thing bye
good luck gum
thanks
elma
i have uploaded all of my 2014-2015 super mario 3d land videos
delete it
i should probably install a virtual machine with ubuntu or something
you're right
drago
let’s collab and do a super mario bros 3 speedrun
i was not informed of this
drago go to taco bell
i should have said chipotle
but they have tacos and burritos
and walmart in the frozen food aisle
i always want to try chick-fil-a
the best thing ever
probably
five guys does have good fries
hmmmm. to study for my midterm tomorrow or to watch gotham
which makes you eligible for a parking ticket
i also like cheese
like some people do
ever had baklava, kugal?
does baklava have lava in it? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it's a dessert pastry made of phyllo bread, filled with a mixture of crushed nuts, and held together with a syrup.
cashews are pfft
help 8 things from my steam wishlist are on sale
so i'm in no way tempted.
it’s too fun not to
still havent touched that yet
despite someone gifting it to me
blackwake is on sale
how does one get someone in trouble in online school?
i came in to class
from the teacher might i add
were you helping students on tests
fuck no
where does this guy live? flubs and i will teach him a lesson
real scary
nah being benny with you
exhibit a: gummy
my friend occasionally looks at me in class and smiles at me...is that a good sign?
then yes its good
do it
mom wants me to abuse, i mean trim the hedges, gummy ill get back to annoying you later
i’m craving a coffee. what’s happened to me
i don’t, so i don’t know why i want one
because i made everyone here addicted to coffee
maybe it’s the fact that i have a lot to do in the next 48 hours and all i want to do is nap 🤔
your body wants you to get coffee ice cream instead 😉
but that’s also like $6
“no drugs as well pls”
i know that weed here is not hard
and then there's stuff like the halting problem and the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics
not stupid to a point where its affecting my well being
i am
this isnt real
sorry that’s happening, blitz
disclaimer
but this fuck makes gummy look like stephen hawking
just to give ya an idea
also take everythign i say with a grain of salt, im just angry, i dont mean anything i say
good choice kugal
im doing it, i cant let today happen again
or that you can’t be accessed by them, so they’d know it anyway
its the red that really pulls it together
maximum full melee flow mode
the focus is all just from running eidolon hunts
i may regret the lack of energy
okay im back from flirting with my hot friend
who said what to me?
soo bella watches it and gives me a detailed summary because my friend said no summary as well
lmao then youd watch it if you really wanted to
also she was applauded that he saw 5 live action films that wasn’t superheroes or animation
and tease gummy
where are my dating advisors?
good luck
good luck bella
what
no flubs and not robot
cool thanks
im not too fond of halloween
go trick or treating instead
ironically last year my place got 0 trick or treaters
one year we turned off all of the lights and covered the door in bloth to make it look totally dark like no one was home and someone stil came up and spammed the doorbell
people are pretty adamant about getting their candy
when i get older im just gonna offer everyone circus peanuts <:kappa:374346980136058893>
only worse thing is apple slices <:kappa:374346980136058893>
lies
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
well that was tragic
it's ok, there's always next time
f indeed
im asking her out thursday
shit i would be older than my big sis
okay thanks but
what
im kinda curious to see what she'll say lol
my friend that is
that is not a pick up line
perfect
that is not normal
we live like the 18th century
enjoy
she did a lot today in a teasing way
jeesh its almost 4, where did time go
screw the bus
sooo if i date her
why would i have it?
i dont think thats how it works bud
also probably why i don’t like them
does everyone use pick up lines on you or what?
why has no one used pick up lines on me?
cause thats the most common answer
boy were they wrong!
i went out of a bathroom
and i don't want to spend money on drops after noticing that recovery time was faster when i didn't use them
with spongebob
dare i ask what his response was?
interesting
my intuition tells me that after a while there's only so much you can measure in the universe, the more advanced you go, the more it transcends the real world so why apply numbers into that context
i can’t get my head around it
i took a look at double and triple integration and holy moly it looks like a ton of fun
play morrowwind. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
herecy
i tried playing morrowind once but if you do that on anything newer than windows xp it becomes a walking catastrophe that i can't be arsed to fix
sounds fun. might be able to later
nobody asked you cortana
ehh just use wine
flubs roll and talk to me
i was busy
but the c did not accept the peace treaty
pls use code word
caught up on last week's flash for the episode tonight
id hope so
they had a strange start schedule but its evened out
everything was great until i went to work
there, i felt more easily irritable than usual
on the bright side, i start recording a new lp tomorrow
i dont think i played anything on the gamecube
i think you asked for an explanation, you didn't ask for a very good explanation
i guess they didnt make any in the years i played nintendo games
sticker star destroyed everything
when is paper skyrim coming out
when elder scrolls 6 is cancelled, dragonite
don't joke about tragedy rc
i would write a very angry letter to todd howard's mother
secrecy
my code suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks heeeeeeeeeeelp
places arent open
we're fucked
amazon is 24/7
yeah but i need this stuff tomorrow morning
nobody has it also how the fuck do you get robbed by a me
enough alcohol to get and stay drunk for all of tomorrow, a cheese wheel, a pinata, and hat
oh wait
howd you get that funky n
also whats with that funky n
whaaa
if you’re on mobile, you can use it
master its cursive
permaban him
i think the elven dagger has the fastest swing rate
sick
sot has more content, which is saying something
oh wait the ghost weapons have lighter weights than normal weapons so they might have a faster swing rate
fuck it
<:doit:334014889137930240>

i have 35 more years of this that's a ripoff
october 14, 2063
yeet
i practically diet off of pizza rolls, ,that's not at all healthy
a majority of my diet is frozen food and cold cut sandwiches
looks like you guys are outliving me
ahhh
i'm just going to check on all three stimulants
its the only way ill survive
that doesn't seem right to me
its the only way ill survive
i’m celebrating by doing nothing
i get out a bit earlier from class than usual today. may watch something on theme. looking forward to discounted candy though
i’ll probably just eat a couple pieces of candy my parents will hand out
i’m 5’8”
-y’all
don’t you mean y’all
no you don't
ida aren't you taller than most people
if it makes you feel any better you're probably taller than ida when she was about six years old
i hate you
hey at least im taller than my maybe gf
tell her to eat her veggies if she wants to grow up big and strong
she’s basically a vegetarian
i'm popeye the sailor man, i'm popeye the sailor man! i'm strong to the finish 'cause i eat me spinach, i'm popeye the sailor man!
you guys dressing up as anything today?
yes im getting dressed becuase i have to get a haircut
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
i have an opportunity to record xenoblade today, the question is, can i be bothered to turn my wii u on
xenoblade it is
i think i did
i should probably go to class soon
we're apparently going to be talking about github again
why must i be so lazy
thats why
i prefer pid personally
shouldve replied "because your mom told me"
lmao
hmmm
two mate oh
lmao even wolfy doesn't like "to-mah-to"
wait you have your normal icon how did you do that?
he probably swapped back after that screencap was taken.
so thats $60 an hour for private security and $2600 for the flight and hotel
hey it's free since siblings help one another
i will pay for her food though
i go to you ida with my friend
better than canadian weather
you guys ever get the feeling that the best way to find points for your argument is the flaws of the antithesis?
i have to do a paper... but its also halloween.
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
its already christmas season
unless dragonite feels like staying up till 2 as usual
watch la la land with me
perfect
tcp stands for "the candy protocol" right
uhhh
ftp is for like lettuce and cabbage and stuff though there really should be a separate protocol for the important stuff
a little late, but i changed my name because i felt like it
nice nice
i do get made fun of too if i slightly grow it out
do tomorrow's physics tonight?
<:doit:334014889137930240>
my physics teacher anyway
perfect <:lul:305559915714576385>
academic or professional?
academic
the skittles have been decimated too but now my tongue hurts too much and i dont want to eat anything else
oh they definitely are
i hate halloween
gummy shut
just dress up as a millennial and knock on the door of every old person in your city and five minutes later youll have more candy than you know what to do with
easy just remind them that your generation is the one supporting social security
halloween is dumb people dont even look like scary
i think halloween is moreso a fashion show now
hey man i profit regardless
im a kaiser
or take matters into your own hands
~~a kaiser roll?~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
okay can't wait for tomorrow
hia gummy
was that a gta reference rc?
so just dont have her say no and youll be fine
aww...
flubs you ruin my day
awww whyd i do that
remember to not overthink it gummy, just ask "do you want to go out with me"
that's not what i was going for
gummy, are you trying to get no one to date you?
no no
at the store, from your sink, in a river
okay idk how woman think and bunni isn't around to tell me
what even is that
you record your office?
i was watching some of the halloween episodes
bleh creed
he only gets more creed-like. its great
like so many times i wish micheal would bully her hard
you think phylis is bad? i think kelly and ryan are much worse because they are so fucking annoying, kelly especially
ryan is one of my favs
of course he went corrupted
but i love ryan
the power he had in season 4
i do enjoy some of gabe's scenes when he's not going crazy for erin
i cant stand final season andy. gabe is also very bad
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
the office
the office
i was confused
jim's probably still my favorite out of all the major characters
depending on context, especially the dwight one
gummy, you're definitely more dwight than jim
what type of bear is the best?
millions of families suffer every year
i donmt get it
because spoopy memes
im here doing hw in the dark
and its not fun
pffft haha
i did stuff
im gonna do that next time
i feel deja vu coming along
if gummy wants to ask her out he must impress her
may i suggest
not on netflix
jeez that box office is a lot
where do i take a girl who only eats veggies and chicken out?
since beef
so she only eats birds, maybe deer
just order a medium rare steak at a nice place and the vegan instincts will be put to the test
depends on how good the date is
i.e. how much your purity score drops
my purity score is like a 90
just do that to yourself mentally
works for me a little too well
that doesn't mean you can do my drugs
there is a 25% chance she will say no
that’s fairly specific
also that ^
the odds are low
plus next step
like movies and stuff
watch her on the bus if she says yes
why do i have to be the "man"
my friend sent me this emoji 😑
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
i cannot abuse the girl
he is lonely
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
sleeping is an art
my new friend hates muskets
for entertainment's sake however, "what seems to be the issue there gummy?"
she is teasing me over snapchat right now
but you're still a tad young for that lol
well yeah
weird, i can do that soon
panda, let's go get coffee
the name is quite fitting in this situation
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
i think usually do almond milk
gummy yeas
not because i'm lactose, because almond taste nice
i can relate, my daily coffee costs me 3 dollars
i'd say mine costs me
hope you aren't actually drinking it everyday
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
straight as the sword she forges?
or like straight as an arrow
well, mostly fittings and horseshoes
horse shoes are the straight things as far as i know <:roothink:399827523581771796>
though she does have a scimitar which is less straight than her
<:lul:305559915714576385>
that spelling doesn’t agree with me
fineee
minié rifle
man she is teasing me hardcore saying all music i am talking about is sooo 2012
post malone? <:roothink:399827523581771796>
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
i'm speaking hypothetically, but you get the point lol
my drug friend
let me repeat that
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
because i took her to the movies
gummy likes to segregate in his mind
and yes ida i have weird friends for example
but she told me
and that i should stick to history
i need help with my hair
i am a hair person
i got acne on my forehead as well
it's okay, she might hate your personality more than your appearance
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
.....
oh we will see about this!
besides you can't hurt me rainy
she will fight you
my own sister against gum
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
okay stop for a sec
you were an idiot
blake isn't fuckin jacked
me neither (sorta)
what the hell is a binky's breeze?
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
those are the best girls
raven, sorta kinda
and she said it's famous and i am an unculture swine
yes, but you see the problem is you never know when to stop
because eventually you cross a line and you go back to us and ask what you did wrong.
when it was quite obvious.
i will stop when i get there
nobody does, it’s okay
see ida gets it
it doesn't make it clear that that's her own grave
my grave!
partly
is this true?
i think i’ve only seen an episode of scrubs
alright, everyone come over to my place, and we shall watch it and have the time of our lives
well ida knows me well how i always somehow i accidentally do it
like my old gf
night sis *hugs tighly*
sleep over?
i prefer a slumber party
you are not invited
fuck twitter just brokoro my kokoro
i told her she is the best
i didnt say you didnt
on purpose
i just said she has more than you.
it’s like what me and drago so
bam roasted
i could make a good choice and sleep earlier than usual
what's this sleep you speak of?
it’s fake
so what's the other option bella?
things like cappuccinos and lattes or something?
i wouldn’t know what to order. i should try that out
of what the literal differences were
if you like white chocolate go with that
good enough for me, thanks guys
oh look it's three in the morning how'd that happen bye
story of my life
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
oh yeah lets give fucking mario another rep but not fucking xenoblade
smash just gets way too much hype and attention
real men play mario kart
mario kart 9 is happening?
probably when the tenth gen consoles come out
next week boys next week....
okay well i blame flubs
well gives me a few days to work out what i wanna say to her
urgh i should probably be doing youtube stuff but i want to play skyrim instead
in the northern hemisphere
next holiday is christmas
sadly.
enjoy
because i left cookies and milk for santa once
apparently not.
flubs.
i need your advice squid
wonderful, thank you
thanksgiving isnt real
why would it be thanksgiving related
i learned about that and i forget if it’s like a halloween december or a christmas october
a character from xenoblade if i'm not mistaken
that certain emperor is me
him too
tsar?
i was actually surprised they're going all out on dlc
oh flubs she got sick tomorrow
how do you know that
its the worst
panda
no problem
and i can’t say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
alright
it was; it’s the main reason why i find smash overrated. that and i’m not a fan of fighting games
we talked about it yesterday
but yeah, rex got relegated to being a fucking costume
hmm?
but it still has my boys
lab was so empty today
yeah, i guess that’s a point
i'm just really grateful that sakurai has and will continue to work on this game for some time
ah, purpleeyes
thou dost amuseth me so
that was because i didnt have enough material though
flubs
i just wish i was actually excited for this smash game. it just feels weird how i’m one of the few people who doesn’t really care about it and this direct didn’t help in that regard.
there you go
second it is
but thats just because nerves
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
who is you know who
i mean theres no reason a girl shouldnt ask out a guy
in fact i appreciate it
i agree with flubs
i think she is waiting for me
its only two late when one or both people are dead
alright but fear of rejection flubs
just have no self esteem
worth it if it works
okay, yeah, true
well she told me i was a great friend today
i was nice then all a sudden i was mens
but fell in college love
here gummy ill quiz you and see if youre an incel. how would you refer to a girl who dumped you to your friends?
oh that also happened
since they were still my friend
so i would say they were sweet?
i got a lot of things happen to me during my love life
i wouldn’t care unless they were still dating someone
gummy you're supposed to learn that in junior high
i slept through it
they started that in 5th grade for us
they told me enough
elementary was 0-6 here for reference
ok but you understand that her being in a previous relationship changes nothing right
what else?
my drug friend almost got pregnant
go on
depends who i don’t like
which is a lot of people
not an a hole
maybe once
you know
there arent really more though
and upset
i just got home what's gummy doing now
in my life time
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
second one
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
people suck
you mean my little one or ida?
in some ways its better
who knows maybe she has a dark side like me
so i don't know what i would do if i wanted to settle down
wait
well if shes looking at my phone im assuming she didnt only look at the google messenger app i havent opened in two months
yet you were in the hospital waiting for her
gummy im a fuckin moron
no no no that is a good quality to have
ahaha no
even though well...
and i cannot stay stable
1 cent
you take my little sister
the book says go somewhere fun
i need someone to help me grocery shop
i'll buy wine
if youre asking them out invite them over
okay...
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
anytime xd
claus looks wrong
history all the way
god i hate november
why is the library a choice?
no offence ida i know you would
culinary arts would lead me to burn everything down
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
wtf a farmer market...that is worse than a library
that is benny's date
not mine
farmers market it is
itd suck almost as much as not being able to find you gba when you wanna play on it
so i would have to pick
where we wanna go
probably helps not to limit it to one place
okay does the girl pay for dinner or is it the guy?
fair rule is whoever asked imo
or what bella said
water
oxygen
there is this good ice cream place...
ice cream is an all weather dessert
true
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
tuesday no matter what
we got a bus advantage
you could help me map out the city
thats not a castlevania game
is there a stream right now?
yes you can
