flubs is hiding nothing
i am surprised you didn't choose oot
they aren't real
pls no not that
maybe i should watch less anime
minecraft style
also make sure to have a great beard and mustache if you're evil <:kappa:374346980136058893>
who what?
and thats it
ive been banned from a server from my username
but is that an ssd
wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
even though i didn't know what the hell i did wrong
only a bitcoin miner is gonna want this anyway so why are they limiting them
nice link <:kappa:374346980136058893>
byezers
and i have to roll it manually and also it isnt a car
it's in morse
you can use my armor in case i don't show up
you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
well he played it through three times in that final area is something.
perfectly fine.
that means you swung to attack.
and does the stump have to be chopped for each of its blocks and not even drop any wood?
do we need a heart for each upgrade?
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
i though drago said fashion for a sec
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
i already deleted all of the installed mods, along with my character and world out of frustration since **no one** here was using the internet besides me
it was, ida.
either way, ill just assume you mean the good kind
i dont really rage at games with good mechanics, so im having a blast
i would not reccomend playing it regardless. i'd rather play four swords adventures than tri force heroes
so i'm going to blame overhaul for my lag
fine fine
i'm not sure what the problem was.
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
it changed my keys
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
how frustrated are you with me
i think i left my cactus armor somewhere
because i think that message may have been ida's
i don't know.
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
just a reminder that 3 diamonds are needed for the storage heart.
and people actually like her music
so much we made a new funny class meme or word
\:thinking\:
oh ok, we'll wait for that then
gummy i will destroy you if i have to
thanks
all 3
i mean...on a normal day everyone is an asshole
currently -23 here
it gets to like 110 sometimes in the summer where i am
what is it stuck
i haven't watched a movie in a long time
quup off
we lost guys
hmmm interesting
im actually really happy 030 was banned, it always took so much effort to not spam the copypasta
either way cool
its like how i have a lot of pictures of pregnant luigi
what?
like if we're in vc and he says "i hate seeing x on twitter" i will instantly send him that
:^ )
flubs did not read pawn
his brother recorded a dead man
sugar
is makeup
i try to hold back.
i’ll send it to flubs because why not
i want to believe they are
it has music playing in it
he isnt a child
it's not that easy
its there, but its like recreating a masterpiece as your first artistic work, you could do it...but it wont be nearly as wonderful
yeah sure why not
don't want to burn out too quickly after all.
wait wtf
hey gummy boop me, for, uh, science \*cracks knuckles\*
who’s that green loser?
brb pasta is overflowing
i need to take care of things irl tonight so i don't think we'll be able to have a session tonight.
uhhhh
hopefully once we get some more life crystals we'll be able to take down eow faster.
or slightly behind because effort
that should be accurate
the c word that isnt crap
well i'm sure there's more than one.
~~rawity~~
and your name is rarity now
you can ask permission from someone whose not the owner and its still stealing though
also made fun of a friend with lewd stuff
if you buy it for a year you get two months free
oh no i didnt mean the food
my pasta
get that checked out
i can't use them here because no one can see them
wowza that's a huge emote
its so dumb looking
yes ida
thats why
it's always weird here in this place, squid
okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
hey flubs
he's probably twenty one in dog years
spooky
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
this rule is for the sake of everyone understanding, not being bent into a spaghetti
all i did was make all the letters the next one in the alphabet
me helping this person will be interesting because this time my age from this person is actually far apart. i’m way younger but i gotta think older and smarter
.
anyway, i have to go to bed no-- hours ago thanks to time zones so bye
i don’t even know what that is
now i want pizza...
fine but if i go to bed before then i expect you to be honest
make games
that’s the word
benny has won a total of $10,000 so far
sooooo all my work just got erased hehehehehehehe
flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night
got battlefront 2
christ, and it takes like an hour to launch, too
i can't tell who raised the hand on mobile
leona mid?
it's just 30 of them.
i just felt like taking a jab at logan paul 😛
eating it
sounded like a cat purring in one eat to me
the p stands for "public", silly goose
perfect ida
gonna try not running as admin on terra
heh heh you see what i did there?
breaking dirt
??? it's already 1 pm
i have one pencil tho
its finnneeeeee
i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
this better work
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
because i couldn't
not just his poor performance
you got two hours left come on sarah what the hell dont walk away come on just play some more we're almost done no please dont leave
so i dont like the beach
i never went to the library
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
he gets to wear high heels
squid, are you a good kiss ass
all of my interests are video games <:lul:305559915714576385>
it would take forever to upload 1080p for me
if he likes you
i dont really care what quality its in
because it is soooo important for me to self promote myself
gummy thas literally even worse
that's not a person gummy
i could tell they were being flirty also
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
good
there was a lot of pressure to be artificially emotionally open in that. there was a release in freedom in that which took a bit to figure out. that and she started to do drugs which kinda hurt to see. tbh i don't even remember what i told you
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.
talk about that
i hate this professor so much btw
waffles or pancakes
plus i got stuck
he effed an underaged student
i remember one time a kid pushed his pregnant gf down the front steps at the school
presenting is fun!
those are the best easymode wings you can get your hands on with thorium
i'm not really a fan of the author of overhaul btw ida
we need to defeat him so that i can get bronze alloy fragments from the marble enemies
yay my uk friend finally woke up
and we're still in easymode
caffeine is a drug
but why will it be a pain to me specifically?
we died so many times to it
also this is gonna be the last boss
damage?
minus ore seeds.
then they're a very messed up family
what if they're tryingt to destroy the world?
i'll probably be able to get to about 54 or so by wof.
what's the damage like?
i got lucky with most of my accessories
is master the most powerful he can be so far?
do you drink cold water then?
we're not going to use old copper tools
if you know you definitely took everything, try to think about other things
what?
episode 2 predicted episode 3
i question if ida ever watched myself
what other browser would u use?
i will show you the cock
nah i don't feel like keeping track
i didn't know that you were you
come join
i'm tired >.>
hes been like a borther to me
depends on what kind of cheese i guess. i havent tried every single type of cheese so i cant say for sure
your name has baconator in it.
....
i'm not trying to sound offensive but y'all seem kinda trict
i’ll make the knife go away
i've only seen up to the jar of dirt movie
now that you say it, we'll probably get raided, dragonite
i have it once a week
porates
ate 1/3 of the one in that photo during dunch today
what?
i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
side note, i made the deans list o:
im constantly on here and not even up to date on the spreadsheets i made for one of the classes. not doing anything officially extracurricular.
if i get nitro
sooooo
i poked my fan with a pen and it stopped not running
...my computer died again
because she did the forcing/blackmail
what would be the offchance of the magikarps having absurdly high speed stats <:kappa:374346980136058893>
the bad end
let's just say it had blackmail in it
i meant blackmail becoming blackma- shit nevermind that doesnt work
wait you guys actually think that's actually that bad?
and i actually am friends with her bestie as well...soooo awkward
a true family
it's worth a try
i never show it though because i just mess around here
that’s just really black and white to see it
i love old warfare over modern warfare
oh trench warfare is wasy to understand
the civil war is so interesting, i really enjoyed reading about it
the sad part is, the businessmen back home were profiting from all this
oh yeah just like ww1
and early modern
peter the great
previous mistakes were repeated
yeah thank god the uk believed in churchill
he never was a miltary genius
but they had the big bad usa on their side
his generals did everything for him
i can't at this point master
dont get civ 6
>that moment when you realize the devourer of gods stands for dog
i got tired of the lead devs immaturity
it was probably the fries that gave you away
i see her bestie giving her a second chance though from what i have seen
i was expecting ice cream tho tbh
yeah so
~~you probably think all war movies are amazing~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
this video i’m working on is probably taking longer than anything else i have done
more disappointed than previously i'd like to assume
haha! you cant block me if i destroy the discord servers!
while, i take less classes these classes somehow managed to be longer.
i’m tired
there's nothing to do in that game
the elder dragon
although i just lost connection
also, did you try fighting skeletron already?
i need the sleep because of college 😑
sounds comfortabale for the eyes
e!says-add i don't know what to do, its working!
teh bass on the right?
whats the screenshot keybind again
if i wasn't, we wouldn't have been able to beat the bosses.
not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
good time of day.
i also got a granite boombox.
actually, i think i might have gotten one of those.
it's fine, wolve.
i'm kicking overhaul out for the next server
i don't think we could even attempt doing death mode
-spirit
-calamity
-elemental unleash
and better bard bits would've helped me do better too. <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
forget it ida
we didn't have a flat world
i've been attempting to dig trenches to stop it spreading to the other half of the map
not even close.
the end items you get from it are op
ah yes, the bees.
like the soc.
krelian, please. ^_^;
it used up every single free bit of space on my drive
yes play the terraria
yeah, that
bella, the tutorials are completely optional and you can do them in any order.
this morning the same was true for me but that was because i'd just been feeding the sheep
taking a break from playing 2 hours of blazblue.
oh fuck
ok i got panda set up
i can imagine the banner having stickfigures in it now
it's follow
canterlot equestria
im not making another.
...on
besides the memes
i'll tell you about flubs pm
i don’t wanna get slaughtered
it takes...a lot...to make me hate someone
crashed.
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
that didn’t take a lot
totally didn’t <:lul:305559915714576385> 
hey they are stupid enough to taunt the bull on the streets
....
the second semester uno distracted me
i have a russian accent except for when i dont which is 99.99999% of the time. i can only do it when i screw up when i try to speak english while translating from russian while talking to parents
you have a biased sample
hey i made more noise than 30 kids in that theatre
it’s not
no the google thing
speaking of playing, we just beat plantera in our game
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
just walk away slowly, animal man.
i am slowly learning more on how to talk like her
bass
not that, you ninny.
cosplay as rarity
and say "thats what i was gonna do"
ayyyy
i have no idea who that is ida
heartgold and soulsilver
it's pokemon black and white and according to drago black and white was amazing
caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
put it in the r4 card thing slot
3 things survived
or paying a lot of attention to something.
press f to pay respects
but i take the blame
sorry
that profile pic is me now
if you wanted to put on makeup that implies you don't have any makeup on.
rc wanna see the full pic?
i don't even wear glasses, i just think it's a fucking dumb reason to dislike something without giving it a chance
sorry
nooooo ida
good luck on that
what do you think star trek even is
some dude with long ears walking around
cuz y'know
close enough
i'd volunteer to do that but i'm too lazy
yeah that means you're doing it right
he’s play but he does similar things that eyan does and says word for word whatever he said on the video
i forgot
here, i have one
gummy dont
i will have to destroy you if you praise ttg again
can i say i’m really excited for the teen titans go movie?
why would you dare
i’m pretty sure none of us have wives, flubs
flubs
i’m still demisexual straight btw
gummy i read a story where fluttersy gets kidnapped and turned into a sex slave then is tortured into becoming a sex addict, i think whatever is in your story is fine
i can’t show it to you
no cadance i haven’t
nope
like idk
he also is attracted to me
oops i typed in "wondercraft" and now i'm seeing a bunch of minecraft stuff
yeah its mlp related
now i can be the vulgar asshole i want to be
nope. not once
bollocks
that isn't me
get the traitor
owo drago hitting his bad bot with a rod
oh fuck
“the fact that you were trying to make it scary is the cute part” - my friend
i assume this gilgamesh dude is your waifu ida
(also it's not real love, it's a fictional character for crying out loud)
its in
he just doesn't have a shirt on.
husbano is for females waifu is more male
are you talking to me in the last message flubs?
try a battle potion maybe?
and who cares if it’s fictional
i see.
tackle and surf
and hey a new person
the paul brothers are loud. you want more of them?
hmmmm
and...splash
they just subbed to me and followed me on twitter
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
fear
makes me feel like i accomplish something
wanna make me not a rough draft but a perfect version of a bio for my twitch?
i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
good
~~ill have fun hehe~~
did we download anymore mods
in her defense cabbage burger sounds really, really awful
and than just use one of the other picks till we have enough for another one <:lul:305559915714576385>
money chest
when women were only valued for their birthing skills
ho-oh
though i really like ivan the terrible
and it wasn't made for him
well not only birthing
you know who was also a good tsar?
and now they exist again
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
you were like
i already explained it to like idk
i subbed in for flubs since he had a disability
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
panda hit me with a bat pls
he didnt make the song...
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
jeez i didn't make much progress there and i'm already feeling tired
super balanced
i think the old tremor guy stole the sprites btw
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
the hallowed megaphone
antiaris is being made by the official tremor team.
i saw that they received a massive rework on the wiki.
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
only beaten the blizzard boss in hard mode.
midnight?
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
a rarity plushie and a tricorne/bicorne hate
i might've forgotten the recipe
(the one problem with that is i'm trash at modeling robots)
i think that's calamity
idk never played it either lol
its gotta be true
drago these are one of the few times that it is necessary
you forfeit your right to be acknowledged whenever you say the word "punny"
i thought panda meant me for a sec lol
i.e. spreading jungle to fix our corrupt jungle issues.
i'm at1038.
our generation is stupid
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
my favorite kind of idiot is the guy who goes on webmd and is convinced he has x horrible disease. what the doctor says doesnt matter. he has it. minor foot pain after hurting your foot? brain tumor. ate too much and your stomach hurts? 5 ulcers.
theyre probably dosed with laxative
it amazes me how you guys can keep track of all of that
do not participate in the life ruining juice
no i dont that one is advil
yeah, that might be treason
yes.
henlo wolve
why eggplant?
now the npc is attacking me for no reason : (
i'll record a gif of it once i get it looking nice
only it was for like 10 minutes
rarity pkushie made in the uk
at least say she
ban them
especially since they make ones not in the uk
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
you would justify it
good night
everyone said it
and everything was so good for those few months
just not as much as actual smoking
when you least expect it
feelsfrogman
not the fictional one
everybody do the flop
what
physics is evil
yeah, why?
hello.
im bored
honestly knowing me since i can’t fit a mlp song actually i might but i am leaning towards a military song
since my escort is also my classmate so we have to switch around when it’s her turn plus let’s say something embarrassing does happen you wouldn’t have to worry because you don’t know anyone there
of course they do
just stand there while everyone dances
glhf
no, it is literally the opposite
you know rainy is right flubs
i reversed your message
i still need to get to level 50...
hgss is my favorite remake
brb banishing myself
that's not pony stuff
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
platinum was the last game to have it
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
that’s photoshop
gummy its totally bc its you
at least she thinks im lovely
we all did
and i still haven’t quit
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
not me.
you hate this place flubs
what rhymes with orange?
ahem ahem *cough* enlightened ahem *cough*
fleshlight
that's the smell of nature, you fool
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
i would work overtime for the computer to mod terraria
coffee drinker
even the decent ones are just not realistic
how much in total?
i do need to buy all the episodes one dat
i kind of gave up once i realized i'm the ranger and ranged weapons drop my fps to shit
it just might overhaul though.
oh alright i’ll just go with bsing
it's worth a shot, at least
i love collosseum and gale of darkness
that's a good idea.
sounds interesting
sorry.
i used mainly jgrasp.
how'd you even get it?
they charge money for use of the mods content.
true
snow
ehh effort
and i’m not learning anything except how to be really lazy 😛
i made a thing
so if i had to guess
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
reee
nothing happen to me
save the portal for next time
good to hear
currently alone in a very empty quiet hallway
that's what i'm currently doing, anyway.
never watched the emoji movie before
college

don't forget her cousin
hmm?
2 was meh
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
that's good ^w^
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
yes rc go ahead with the snarky
label?
more than you
i’m still not there...
the port of crystal (the best pokemon game) to the the 3ds
i’d recommend it
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
your feet
my sister has noticed that i have weird friends
yeah me trying to pogo myself onto my desk using one hand
beacuse i am mad
also insane
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
e!will
making flubs regret having faith in humanity, you can do quite well
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?
idk why my classmates made a big deal about it
it’s fun
seriously my cabinets have chips and other snacks, my drawers have cookies and other desserts, and my shelves have high quality spices
i watched the trailer
i can't find my stress ball
but but a sword is cool
so asshole was an asshole, huh?
i never helped people in the past
i have like 0 friends irl and im 100% ok with it because irl people are weird
nvm i guess `@eyan`
if you got money yes
it's not a kingcorphish repeat
oh but dont let me stop you from streaming every minute of every day for the rest of time
i’m at my nephew’s 3rd birthday party and there’s several kids. i feel like running into a wall
dragonite
well from what ive heard if youve played hgss you havent missed much
he likes the taste of face
crystal is my favorite game in the series
also, he has 7 pokemon
kappa
a rydon
also, nice zeke pic
black and white really are the most divisive pokémon games. you either love them and they’re your favorites or you despise them
i have to leave the room before i start yelling at him or worse
also, it felt like they were changing things just to change things
yeeeeeeeeeeep
you are not, you delusional bird
i already read it
oh, it's just alchemistnpc.
it's a loot magnet from luiafk.
ouch.
i guess they're giving them another chance since this was a one time thing
whos to say i wasnt born in 1700 though
something happen?
"my year is bigger but hers is longer"
what are you going to do
anything else?
it isnt important. but damn that is not a safe for work photo
....
no you....
no the other one
11k gold in the bank
okay cya guys tuesday
she was having a nervous smile
this clip is a very low standard for both faith and a very high standard for humanity
so all the other consoles and pc can play together
why is there an actual currency based on garlic bread
and my sister’s dog was making a lot of noise cleaning itself so that didn’t help
like that?
how the hell did you get that
yes and no
garlicoin, actually
i really question the use of math sometimes
i'm not going to be using this crap anytime soon
because i'd like math to teach me the practical aspects of it, and then have something else give me critical thinking skills
you're gonna need to be using problemsolving
but im not about to fucking wall mount a third
i have tons
what is with all of the icons
since adobe is being a jerk and is charging monthly
wait they finally took cs2 down frmo their web site?
they weren't stupid enough to not learn from their mistake tho
so you are all time travellers?
is rarity an old lady confirmed?
y'all just hatin
my picture is gary busey, flubs != gary busey
and cadance we already have gummy we don't need more ponnies
"there's no reason to quote me"
i don't think skarm cares enough right now, as usual
no you aren't
cs4 might've been the latest version i used
i just wear shoes bigger than my foot
what is spelling
im 5 11 but have tiny hands and feet
i'm guessing a lot
i can't stand that stuff
my parents dont know what patreon is and that';s probably a good thing
i know, with the money i have, if i had to start paying rent and other payments, i wouldn’t have any left
i was responding to stuck's last message to me
i need to go do homework and discord is too distracting
urgh, i should sleep too. but this is the first time ive gotten to write real code in a few days and i'm trying to fight the withdrawal
squid just dont believe in it
brb screen break
that’s not a lot
it's not too big a deal just annoying
enlightened has right to read message history, but i'll give him earthbound just in case to avoid this in the future
get to it
greetings, cadance.
a gif, i guess
now those shifts are fucking awful
because i know for sure no one will get it right, even flubs
if mr cadance ever asks me again why i like rarity, i got a list.
if things end up going to hell when you and cadance have that chat, then i'll just pin it on dragonite
annoyingness
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
may 29
...what?
🎉 or 😱
art class is stupid
laziness, depression, busy, laziness, fixing depression
shockwave flash rarity?

real white chocolate chip muffins are chocolate muffins with white chocolate chips inside
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
i want a muffin

mmmmmm the ground
all other languages are inferior to vb
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
i consider is a quality of life mod
i don't want there to be too much lag
nice
👋 bye bye overhaul i never want to see you again
not even kidding.
those were neat.
yea, i'll do my best to design the base better this time.
can't too tired
yeah i was wondering before when you first said it
<:lul:305559915714576385>
eew gross why do you have poewrpoint and onenote pinned
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
how about that weather?!
and that's just one item.
most of this quarter's assignments were about an event based on floating marbles on tin foil
in a holy shit my mouth is burning but i'm also hungry kind of way
not bad
imagine that
fibus lusec wecos vinosec

now it's a force schedule your video
thats how you are supposed to upload now on twitch i gues
how many views
owo what kind of school is this
thats twitch, rc
because you two were having a ban fight
thats how many pirate hunters there are left
why does dragonite need to be the one to do it?
everything?
i think i canm adjust the countdown
ida calls that targetting and stuff
we already know what you're gonna pick tho
well i already say muskets anyways so i choose darling of course
the darling and kiddies ides
rc, squid, master, wolverale, and draco helped me with this one
its a sword, how can it fit into a little hard drive?
this will be very limited
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
not that wand, ,flubs
i also get my ass beat my the main villain in the final battle
hey, i need that to breathe
good
this is the kingdom of zeal
i’m not uploading to twitch anytime soon, so it doesn’t bother me
glhf
even with a job
so i don't have to do that ^^^
they're just going back and forth with this
doing well.
you already do, ninny
*pokes gummy with a stick* xd
!rank
how are you guys doing ^w^
do you think ida hates me?
probably could but this dress is expensive
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
stuck why would ida do that to me?
i didn’t buy it
my intro is pretty good
lapel
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
i mean boo
yay the plushie empire is now the sharing lewd pics empire

<a:spinning:395030946921054208>

i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
yeah, that's an image i'm going to need to bleach out of my head
followed by a picture of felix that my better judgement tells me not to post here
darling
i'm afraid to join vc xp
oh jesus
how dare somebody play my champ
it's fun
~~one of us. one of us.~~
when
you killed my father
ever put a mint in your mouth, throw out the wrapper, and then regret every choice in you life as you wade through the fucking trashcan so you can spit the disgusting, horrid, satanic waste of glucose into the wrapper?
and i’m sure this could add fuel to that fire
basically a color override.
!rank
i wonder what other rank ups could’ve been
on ps3 anyhow
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
i see.
<:yea:327308337722949642>
i'm sculpting models right now, squid.
did you see the pic rc?
so i finally watched cars 3
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
wasnt an issue yesterday or before tho for some reason...
kitty
ask master
the world doesn't revolve around you, gummy.
i don’t have flubs calling me brother
wait thank god squid is now pink
get the chat to fight and blow things up
it is
he’s going to die
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~
henlo shade
remember magic wand

flubs
flubs is great
good
i love hnnngggg-ing
that too lol
i arrive back

figured out how to make a brachistochrone in excel
but for now that'll have to wait
brb life
test
oh hai
pokes gummy
duke nukem reference.
nothing, like that
play mini golf them
oh hey, you're dunban now, rc?
particularly the bones part
and yay
you are not worthy
i will not stay calm
ill link ones that i see
another eagles touchdown
how do chips get priority over wifi
darn
eating
my tradition is just not watching the game
trimming takes too much effort
i tried
damn misspelling...
e!bot
don't beat my sis
so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
"greater masa mune" was the purple override.
guess i am a female
they look like they’re supposed to be shopkins, but toilet-matter themed
what game is it?
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
yep just heard my dad freak out about it lmao
adventurous
still due
a bit of both?
^ dragonite quote not mine
~~what if you don't know what race you want to choose, wolve?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
no its a color
even if he was a melee guy during the mage quests
i just smashed him since my first character was built to kill mages
dammit (follower name here)
i don't really have any followers tbh lol
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
same
we did it guys
he's trying to get in my ear
plz repeat stuff
it's fun
they let you on phones last year in spare
being an administrator isn't easy at all.
plus a server which is connected to the dm
a group dm ida
i measured my cup
knew that was going to happen
well there was one that came from dragonite that was punctuated.
or twenty
my catchphrase is better
nvm just throwing it on the spreadsheet
ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
that's not good news
pot meet kettle, gummy
i never guilt trip you
6 questions
reminds me of myself
did i just walk in on something here
best i can do is 4.5 questions
notice the "man"
*you got me* shut up thoughts
it’s annoying to the bot that animal man is a guy?
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
i'd say around 3.28
i might end up leaving
but not here i need you
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
i eat babies
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
at this point, i'd just let them tear each other to pieces. if it's being straining to your health, it's probably the better initiative to leave
thanks
but drama is fuuunnnnn
no no lets
goood gummy
or pregnant luigi
i wanted to be blue :c
im no friend of his
the adage is "half your age plus seven"
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
but until that day
the bot is taunting me
okay jumbalaya
never most likely
why skarm why?

my singing needs work on
let me guess: same person?
how goes things?
i see then...
um thanks rainy
they’re well. just waiting  to get to my stop for the subway
it takes a lot most to understand, but you have much more control over what things do.
how are you?
because flubs is more fun
`private final boolean masterisabutthead=true;`
darn i thought it was genetic
i'm not fun
partnership for peace?
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
could be worse rares
enforce strict equality throughout the entire source code.
oh, and there's also the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by the means of books.
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
like how spanish is very useful here in the us.
and that too
i had one once
it was at first
wow before premiere it had quality options
keyword: should
irl, i have no patience
it’s weird if you ask me. not as bad as garbodor, but still
i will never understand why anyone like it. unless you are a poison type lover
anyone here have a good recipe for pizza sauce?
i think i am seeing things
wasted over 10 hours reuploading episode 11
not that one
i think ida doesn’t like me now 😛
probably but gummy is known for being solo and lonely
ida what else do you thinki do that’s a waste of time?
no one talks to him
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
only 75 hours?
chrome
e!censor-remove kaiser
great suspended turned out to just feel annoying for me
why's that?

brb looking up how many joules are spent in an hour long bike ride at fifteen mph
youre still weird though

i didnt do an analysis but it happened to me two or three times

just my mom....
it’s been more than 15 seconds since he last said something
nice
drago
so i just made some more pure gb today
whelp.
sure, give me a minute.
archive them somewhere or something
time in woe is rarely solitary, since you usually end up having to explain yourself to one or more of the gurus
im allerguc
you think we should hold off for updates?
your advice worked
i’m nit picking probably haha
you didn't ask for a good explanation
close
same person, gummy?
in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
also kicking the creator of the bot on that server isn’t a good idea as well
how do you add water cooling to a bot
welcome to zeal simulator 12kbby
use sylveon lol
no squid that’s inappropriate
drago loves me squid
gummy can you nickname a pokémon after me
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
i wasnt even home
said you were
i gave flubs rice with vinegar
and they want to outplay inflation in profits i think
no 5th supergummying youtube anniversary
no dont expect nothing. expect idiocy and explosions.
ironically, the first time i watched basketball was the 2004 olympics where the us team lost <:lul:305559915714576385>
i guess i missed the part where dragonite's name was changed to 'screw you master - guru of screw'
until you quit this server?
and hey you have bad apple yay
that costs money
ahh starting week count on monday

im too busy trying to sing chant du départ
what? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
well it’s an impacted major
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
whelp.
time to scramble
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
not the greatest.
everything alright?
i just checked and i think it’s getting close to 20 more

i've seen that one.
doit
happy late birthdayy!!
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i don't really have experience with skyrim or modding it so i don't have any number of modded skyrim in action.
im on it
i somehow win despite not being in any part of this.
okay then
<:treason:396483914803445761>
and thumbs up had its own glitch
“prick”
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
i didn’t. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
fuck you too
i already promise not to have a huge freakout ever since the october 8th 2016 at 7pm incident
my temper is bad though, i will freak out
promising to not be upset is like promising to not die

my dogs are sleeping and im so jealous because i want to catch up on some more sleep as well
what kind is it?
yes it was dumb bird
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
now it feels like the bot is being sarcastic
there's another good response
<:lul:305559915714576385>
oh man, that one.
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
welcome back, aqua.
oh that makes sense

nope
it was probably the cooldown
the teacher says putting comments into code is good

and i don't wanna do a sidebox
that is ok
you now have to kill her and gain her power?
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
how do you drink pie?
was that nontoxic
that... doesn't answer our question.
no kill me

welcome. have a baconator 🍔
namely, her.e
i’m thinking of james’s bottle cap collection (guy from pokemon)
all caps are great
oops caps
what was i being thanked for
good job
this is what i look like
whenever people ask me whether they should do this or that in a video game i know nothing about, i tell them to "follow your heart" works every time <:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
also a few milling subscribers and a thriving youtube channel but that's beside the point.
madness
wow, grade a english on my part
oh man we're havin' steak for dinner <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>

（。_°☆＼(- – )
i should probably leave, class has started.
\the adventure one is sfw
well don't throw up in here
funny how a jerk friend tried to convince i really was a lady and that my brain was telling me i wasn’t
i think it might be for the upcoming underground boss
explanation please
i don’t speak in cursive

frickin captain colours sounds better than that
sonanoka~
the princess of snow
~~cut it off to spare the pain~~
so many scottish accented voices shouting "think you can take me?" in my head right now, this is normal
i see.

theres a few good ones tho
i'm sure that music made by ordinary people has more passion in it
hey i nolife plenty
that sounds stupid
i hate burritos

i spent most of my time on the internet on cartoon network and nickelodeon’s websites
at least make an effort lol
i can’t stay up for 24 hours
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i never played colosseum d:

that good?
raw fish?
well the "ryzen 1600" is specifically the cpu of said computer.
awua
because i remember there was one point that eyan was trying to be a summoner and was looking for a slime staff.
~~set it on fire~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i mean there's probably a way to program the bot to remove reaction if it was added by someone else
i question how effective that solution is
<:treason:396483914803445761>
gummy prefers green?
pay eyan $5 and that'll be a yes
which colors are still available there?
eyan is the best king in the world, god save the king!
enhanse
idk about htat one
you have to look really close and cross your eyes and poke yourself in the face with the arrow tip
and that’s not green
never thought i would see this day
if it's what i think you're referring to, then we are not going to start up
im talking to her ex bestie

it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
"hey!"
i also like just drunk ideas in general
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
for chrome?
and no, mother 3 is not confirmed
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
no clue
yeah i see the 50% mem 30% cpu from taht one lol

hey, i’m not the only one who dies here.
again, are we dealing with the bot or gummy at this point
good
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
xcom
cosmic chicken
it's been fantastic
thinking like a game designer
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
oh i didn’t mean it like that
honestly i kinda believe andi would do something crazy like this
i'd pay money to ban this entire server just because i enjoy anarchy
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
the end
"i'd rather be in the obituaries."
from what i heard, she was a no-show sunday. she first called and said she couldn’t work, she got a court summons. but, the supervisor who answered the call called her out and said that the courts are closed on sunday
this is one of my favourites, because princess

im weird
a little bit of both i’d say
iirc
<:lul:305559915714576385>
*burns snapchat* there was no use to that anyways
master controls fibus
its a new record on the timer
okay was it the bot or the game that dragonite was referring to, in terms of the image.
attention citizens of zeal
flubs?
time to ask everyone to follow me
gather round gatger round i have great news
i demand violence
even talking about treason is treason
wrong person, damn you
dont you not though? isnt a thing with nitro that you can use any custom emote anywhere?
my bad wrong server
i should get it, but again...lazy
you can stop with your pickup lines now
jokes on you i have a neckbof iron
i said dragon, not dragonite
connection issues
definitely
it's just getting better and better.
i need protection
x&y has always been hated
wait a minute that’s my new slogan “gum is always watching”
gen ii is still my favorite.
i love it when you guys think im crazy when i explain things put of context
congrats
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much
modulo.
i wanna get an inkay though
how do i hide channels again?
oh and fries get a free pass ofc
only thing i care to eat from there is their pancakes, hash browns, and parfaits

<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
i approve. =w=
i’ve only had sushi once in my life
besides olive oil in my ear
oooo i love that song
honestly maybe i do have a personality disorder
that's not fun
because it works
i have the sudden urge to open bot dot js and fix all of master's lousy formatting decisions
this is true
~~dragonite is *steamed* at steam.~~
it was funny
we all know i wont but thanks
pretty easy to find
i'll try to look for it in that shithole called weeb chat
wait
you never talk to me
just use a vacuum
that's my job
maybe
why do you keep shoving things down my throat?
$60 and i only played it for 5 hours
yup master jinx me
ech!
that’s blitz’s thing
star wars isnt my favorite thing
now how will i move
to have something in common: to share the same interests ~~or have similar characteristics~~
well today was a horrible day
this is a mutual despise of the others interests
until today
woo, another computer issue solved.
thats not something in common
i despise it but i don’t fully hate it
is that the first action directed at wolverale, now
i ordered two...
mystery dungeon explorers of sky is stupid
ok yeah thanks now leave
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
hg/ss is so expensive. a new copy is $799

the dog
did you see godzilla blow up the mailman?
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
a dog didn't explode the mailman though, a giant mutated lizard did
rest well then

*struggles*.... hmm
i dont know who exactly has the perms but youre the highest up thats online
its a psychic scream
time to level up
thank you
i mean you get to choose
it probably won't, but it also probably will
he said go minimalist on it so it probably isnt gonna make it
well to his credit, master. the third most recent announcement in blackomen *isnt* explicitly stating that
i don't think it's much to ask for a little respect via the honor system.
well
ergo, he is better
try getting on my level (14)
and getting up at noon
he won the biggest level up message war so far
wait isnt it like a lot less than halfway though
really
error 251: insufficient quality of music found
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs
i kind of don't hang out here anymore
which is rarity and she isn’t real soooo
like
well best girl
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>

i just wanna re sub then sleep
against sivir azir rakan
i dont know how to respond
there are 3 of us
yeah wolve do that if you value your time sanity or happiness
sometimes it takes 2 seconds other times its like half an hour
nice
few days later and i just remembered how bad it is
i blame drago
hey man turn that frown upside down
it sounds interesting
theres nothing in the bullet
oh, maybe
~~well she did or didnt so its obviously 50/50~~
but double team umbreon just murders
i’ve been wanting to play emerald again. but, i’m not sure if i want to play with my copy or find a rom like sigma emerald or something
i know right?
i'm aware of that, skarm
potentially
not even an error?
where's the 3rd guru?
those
yeah thanks
though i don’t think you will give me a wand
the part i don't understand is the system of magic used in chrono trigger
wh- oh. skarm is being punny again
skarm does not want battle revolution
colress is good
i can keep talking shit about gen 5 <:kappa:374346980136058893>
n is awesome
now let's try this gif
i can also talk shit about gen 6.
that was a horrifying buildup
the one without profile pics
they bashed manechat all the time
good kob
i don’t like ghestsis.
everyone has trouble with ghetsis, i consider it probably the hardest fight in the series.
but it's toxic there
also ypure not supposed to like ghetsis lol
now to check if gpu prices dropped at all...
yup twitch support is on it
just think about flavors of pasta
those are tasty things which in this scenario overrules important
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i’m listening to this instead of stephen&friends broken picturephone. what am i doing with my life?
i used to be a fus, now im a dah
^ this is really quiet

the kappa
<:lul:305559915714576385>

back in albany he was teaching dance for 50-60 hours per week
wait a second
his name is hilbert, get it right
holy shit there's actually people helpless hg me clean this year
i thought it would fall to deci since youre not married yet
let me count
by the way you shoudlnt be drinking the water
welp
well i once got my butt kicked when i played on emperor mode in civ
you didn't even get the joke.
i didn't know it was difficulty
why have you been doing that up to now?
and gummy's desires further worsen the situation
my code isn't working and i have no idea whyyyyyyyyyyyy
my mom’s birthday is friday
you're changing your name back to gummy? that's good news to me <:kappa:374346980136058893>
“more qualified individuals” who is qualified in shipping gummy with a fictional character?
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
smirking got me to level up 😃
but i play online, so i can’t pause
that took years to make
ask my brony friends
no skarm turn yourself in!
and they started asking me advice
indeed, in fact that is typically all we use to communicate on this platform, are words words words (and the occasional emoji in the form of a reaction or one of those like o-o things
nope
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
you caught me
it's just my alt dont get excited
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
what drago said
gossip leads to bulli
yay!
dangit
since you said it was i said yeah sure let them in there
i return with cake
good job master (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
also wolve isnt that like the most boring part of the game?
math
i was never a true zealian
also my asshole friend is on vacation
i was actually going to ask her a questions but got scared
she plays a lot of characters besides twilight like timmy turner
well if he constantly says he’s 11 and to leave him alone because he’s young but acts like 11
lol yup
2am and still not tired
if fifteen year old dragonite showed up here i probably would have banned him by now too
then i point you to r/choosingbeggars
but er good thing all the lessons drago taught me flew out the other ear
okay, that was a lie
i hope i find someone someday who is extremely untidy and can't cook for shit
i mean
botw > skyrim
i could go for some java
ehh you capitalized it so my code says it's completely different
gkhf
oh hey, twitch unbroke
although for some reason the link to zeal palace doesn't work
this is operation fat dragon
well why didnt they do what they can do now
lmao
theres *kinda* a third dimension
fuck you, flubs
you scared gummy
!image twitch lol
what is wrong with me this week?
it looks like im saying fuck you to myself
dismebarks
i have no clue
and ew
yeah they gave me a full refund and yeah
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
nintendo should make all the main pokémon games available on either the 3ds/wii u virtual console or if the switch ends up getting a virtual console
sideways, dammit...
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
he lost that match
i wish i could.
damn
he subbed in for flubs with the village burning thing
ahh yes, the love triangle between the human, the robot and the whatever constitutes a flubs
i think
ok hi bot
oh right tahts in unix
should i set the starting counter to like 2?
....drago
get ida to help im lazy and tired
get rekt
skarm knows all
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era
thank
but they are at war with me
turns out, if the subs don’t watch x amount of videos as they come out, they just straight up don’t get notified of the video
inb4 it's a ragnarok drop
something something ritual of the ancestor moth
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
no i noticed
what about the battle sprites?
i just dont recall the mini character items being thorious
i try to have a 10-7 sleep schedule.
"manechat"?
gummy how many times do i have to describe "go up the chain of command" to you
flubs calls a lot of people that rc
i’d listen if i wasn’t in public
whoops
then have someone else do it
the "asshole" actually inform me what was happening
ok, who was the queen disguised as in the phantom menace?
steven stone is just as physically attractive
yeah that’s how you spell it
when is 0 bby?
now youve awakened xeon
panda sneaking around
im hungry
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking

ones cs the others ca
why not do some deep thinking?
you get to see kangaroos though
i'm still not sure if i would want to join or not.
alright. i’ll pm you mine
don't even know what that is
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
the best thing i can make is a first rate ship
darn! how dare that country actually defend themselves!
greetings, bella.
no thats one of my guys
remember screw the brits, screw the danes, and fuck prussia
might fill the spot with mario kart or something
i’m going to burn britain down

you must not pay attention to her, i hit her with a truck
it’s a union
they would be the best of friends
mo but that has happened
ah i see you are a man of culture also
i love it when someone babysits me
you know that website that majestic sent you a while ago?
and theoretically you cant trick your brain to be happy but you can force it to be
no remember you were the father
<:gwtogareee:384871962519797760>
hold on
but i closed one
gummy, just tell an agent that you are a terrorist, then  you won't be going anywhere
put a spoon in your underwear and then when you're pulled out of line at security tell them you're being held against your will
an artist must work in the shadows to serve the light
have you even tried my new season?
my asshole friend got the biggest job
./confuse

gummy what the skitty are you doing up at six in the morning
sup nerd
so thats interesting
nothing
i was referring to one of the early scenes where baby rodney was crying and they turned down the volume with a dial that was basically his ear.
even more odd when someone else posted and said it will be on adult swim
id give you my old one but i doubt you want it lol
fuck yeah

that one was my bad
it cant be eaten
nice
and i have no idea
thou shag eared villain

oh that's what i did for computer science
yeah there are many types of seizures actually

i doubt theanimeman or any other anituber will act like it existed
also i love how i say women take forever as my pfp literally shows that...
thats impressive
we need you to throw some people for squid
i would have a lot of eyeliner
hey master dont mine that mine, that mine is mine!
cause this mine is now mine
did everyone hear what happened with doublelift
same here
with real gold on them
my parents told me not to buy them much and to spend my money for myself but i was like no
that girl who spent $700 today spent $400 on one pair of shoes....
a guy i made friends with showed me the name im not in it
that looks like the bone meal
mm'hmm
two wine glass
nice

it's better than megashark but consumes more ammo
best 8 hours of the day
i just found out about that
on it.
dessert
can't wait to get back on ethernet
actually, is it just rng farming? cause that's fine
thunder wave is a really good move overall.
have fun with the ragnarok
i never experienced the celebi event first hand because my parents didn't want to leave the house the day i wanted to go to gamestop to get it because it was raining
depends on the weekday
even a lot of people who don't like gen 5 like n
i feel like most of the games since the beginning of gen 6 are rushed
my problem was we were getting a 3rd game too soon
halfway to reddd
i love gossiping for some reason
~~and lags you if you don't have a good pc.~~
how did i know that would get pinned? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
we can set a cooldown on it lol
felt like touhou on like, normal-to-hard
i assume for the video-game variety?
need a one word synonym for controller
uhh what?
our tour guide pretended his coat hanger was a magic wand today
spaces are also for scrubs
holy fuck everything in switzerland is expensive
i think that's a record
girl underwear drago
be nice to the coffee machine skarm
guys how long do you think before he gets to the good part?
is this the game-wide record?
e!react 431604441700106250 👍 s
gotta love free destruction level ups
test
whats the level cap in skyrim?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
e!react 431604943464693761 👍

i am so confused
sleep is not a thing i got last night, bye
for the stream playthrough?

tour company said you must be “18”
it must have been tough adjusting to the time difference
no flubs
oooh its a party in commons
dammit skarm
did someone say sleep until noon
i almost said detonator but thats silly the detonator is in the bomb
also holy crap youtube's autoplay algorithm is like 5 billion times better than their shuffle playlist one
now i want to pull apart my laptop
works like a charm
god admit swarm you failure
did you see drago?
you lack the required spacing
whats with the face?
but they call it that
im gonna be hungry regardless
for some reason i didn't see the reply.
and i already saw it a couple times. i am subscribed to him <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i would go
all implies everyone's
i went on the side of the guy you almost watch die
so must make an anthem
the quest should still be in your to do list tho
isnt alduin really easy to kill though
they give you other buffs
she insinuated some very rude things about my ancestors being related
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
like...everyone knows the people all die so who gives a fuck
and took the free money
he got depression for a while but he has since recovered from it and has been streaming for most of that time, hes busy with a job rn but it is in future plans to overhaul youtube
a lot of things
guess i can go with cozy mode for a while then
screw it, not waiting for this to finish rendering, it's 1:23 in the morning and imma sleep bye
im not looking for ping time
i thought you could just type throw error into a function?
they have a food about it
at least it kept recording
my league client has failed catastrophically

good job
which is a shame, means i missed out on pizza delivery sivir
do you have food
okay, that's kinda great.
hey, i was going to eat that squid
so it's a name pun.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
wolve, you're a grnius.
point goes to wolveale.
:feelsannoyingman:
from shadows of almia.
uh oh.
plus, you can’t take pokémon out of certain areas until post game. and the 2nd and 3rd games have side quests
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
my team in platinum was infernape, abomasnow, floatzel, dragonite, and...  i don't remember what else i used since it's been years.
oh, he used a buizel.
just make bidoof the best pokémon ever <:kappa:374346980136058893>
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
*sees new pin* <:lul:305559915714576385>
later, squid.
i thought they looked oddly reflective
boring
or just a generic outage?
and it uses jpeg images
wowsa.
its a collage of 3 images one of them being negated and all of them being mirrored diagonally
yeah
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
i used excadrill in my black playthrough and i was quite happy with its performance.
wish there was some way i could help.
you mean loot cubes with a mob spawner?
terraria: a game a lot of people play that i have no interest in <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it's the perfect pink nu quote
i got a really good paxel and scepter.
now that that's over with, can i wipe my rank and start over?
because they feel like it
ebony warrior
by the way, wolve.
oh god, he's lost it
was there 8 of them? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i died for the xth time. good thing i have plenty of max revives that can’t be destroyed or taken away from me
(though i'll admit i hated the art style, for some reason)
i vote option a.
remember kids, always make the best use of your situation
and we're done
same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
it's mostly cats playing musical instruments
oh yeah another great thing about the db
shadowmere
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
i had to take it off because it felt like i was eating a sloppy joe
but does a tough battle make a good character?
please dont blow up dan
point to a direction
that works too i suppose
my soul is an eye
it was so bizzare
like...its either liking an early gen or hating all early gens for not being new enough
hey thats what i heard
oooh sounds tasty
and current events are a grey area
wrong answer
i mean i never talk there either, but it seems like a friendly community
it's in the game
wait what the fuck theres a bards college in skyrim
these are dark magic bombs
feelsfrogman
my word against yours
plus daedric hand
remember, im pushing for the skyrim/prequel meme crossovers
nice
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
while im trying to also work on another monitor
now i just need to come up with good designs for it
firered omega (at least the version i have) doesn't back-implement mechanics.
in black/white, i went back to nimbasa to fight the trains there all the time.
nice giratina icon
im just saying i like seeing them clearly
master, are we going to have a single house for the npcs or several houses that we build up over time?
this again?
anime titties
(i'm not really, i just hate the taste)
all titties are beautiful
thiccccc
yeah you definitely know when you got it
you can narrow down the suspects
i think we’re talking about this because i mentioned not feeling well
mr meatball nose
but i love zebstrika ❤
that changes nothing
so we can replace chests with other chests?
i was about to say and you thought diver was good
the fork is a weapon. it deals 1 damage and cant be boosted.
i can feel them
"if it ain't broke, don't skittying fix it"
yay i got occlusion culling to work
solstheim
work is never fun
he'll bow train even before the mission lol
correction: if had some entertaining features in the netcode
ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow
and all of a sudden, i feel tired...
i still have to work until 7:15
activate work sleep
i just got back from work
i know the feeling ida
and no
that's what i thought

good, it's working
that's very generous
what story
i am the department of health
im waiting for the good part which im assured is coming
oh dear
welp guess ill go kill alduin for the first time
fetch quests are boring to me
the ocean one?
i never play competitive games though, i've always been a solo player
like what?
i’m back from work ya ninnies
and i don’t know why, but my phone battery was going down really fast today. it was at 3% when i got home. it never gets down that low
im confused now
after a while phone batteries just shit themselves for some reason
shoving off to sleep, was nice knowing you, etc, dont burn the place down, etc, etc, etc
unless his discord username is different now.
too bad this is fireproofprooffire
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
i've actually started using items less since i've gotten better at the game.
help im bored
100% oj, 2d game.
reminds me a little of world of final fantasy with the chibi-like characters.
he actually went with sprites for the game "because it was faster".
and now im gonna feel like an asshole when it turns out he had a perfectly valid reason not to come in
step 1: open the computer
and it's causing hadvar to skip around helgen
ughh, i have to do bleak falls barrow to do the civil war?
argonian?
hi home, im dragonite
fucking bullshit
no you just have to do bleak falls barrow
it was only 2 feet deep
what are you playing? emerald?
you got it
thats how high up we are
t=+10 minutes and the teacher is talking about scifi military strategy with a student
yes but why
also i think tolfdir just needs an alembic in every room because this is the 3rd time im finding it for him
because that sounds violent
i feel like my eyes have been opened
my dog is bad at pooping
you ate some thing edible
tell the physics gnomes to stop fucking around
yea.
they suck
doesn't hurt that dragoon has like always been my favourite ff class
could you imagine doing a group playthrough on medium core?
seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
there's a thing called raids going on blade and soul
just go resub
<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
avicii was just found dead
*shrug* the instructions said not to
pretty big guy iirc
never got into him myself but yeah
this dude
and try to put iron your bread without asking 2-4x
butter luck next time

no, that is incorrect
is it bad that i can only assume that's m.website programming?
i just did
it deletes a quarter of its messages when  there are more than 8k messages
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
i know
i don't think you can get a dump of ios.
saw this stephen face in his discord, had to show it 😛
this is healthy
someone enlighten me on how that qualifies as a "meme"
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
defuq does that mean
guts cancels it out.
true.
sounds good
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
well i found my 5 weapons to go for in pre-hardmode.
i had a few gold.
it's similar to fargo's but it allows you to summon minibosses and rare enemies like the lost girl.
the amazon?
frost giant.
i dont see why not
i'm gonna build my karma by being super nice and giving people stuff so that i can eventually guilt anyone who get's cenx's armor to give it to me
alrighty.
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
except cenx's set
ehh, i'll just grab everything useful and we can sort out rules on friday
why wouldn't i?
ahh, i get that from eyan
you idiot
reaver shark
until next time, gentlemen.
with your chickens in 3 of them
not in that order
thank
good luck with that
hmmm
which had explosives in it
list all the methods of lcass corpus
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
good job
save the flubsing the place down for flubs
okay anyway im sleep now
oh those are nice
thank you kind sir
lol, got a clam cane farming for sea stars
play some portal two. theres a part in there where he kills you.
well i like luigi for reasons other than dabbing
premiere prides itself on being slow tbh
who downvoted that
but actually the best way to edit movies is to write individual java programs for each video to be edited by them
you kidding me? i just screenshot each individual frame, paste them onto powerpoint slides, and program the slide show to go through 30 slides each second
moviemaker[][]
okay in all honesty powerpoint's animation options are honestly really good in some cases
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
good job
it used to
movie maker is nice
speaking of video editing, i should edit video
i like potatoes. do you like potatoes?
but i don't feel like editing video
no you just havent caught up with death yet
although i broke that trend.
do i get another trophy for level 60?
you fit right in here. =w=
won't have to do those things for another year
calc is great because it combines that numbers sense of math with physics applcation
just the one.
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
there's a bit of a bug with marisa and alice.
that*
we didnt do much abs in precalc
deriving matrices ??
oh nice
whats ab again?
and by recently i mean a few months ago
oh wow really? i heard some can solve equations on their own and stuff
well damn, there you go
not a full clear though.
lol it's really not that bad, simplifying is probably the hardest part and still thats pretty easy
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
why are we talking about trees now
differential equations can be hard though
the formula was n² + n - 1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
hang on
so you have to type in (-1)^4
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
well you shouldn't "ignore" feedback on a video
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
that is new
i don't bother leaving comments cause i'm afraid people will come after me
so clearly he knew he screwed up
assholes need lessons taught to them
yea, fun fact i never named my chanel after him, i was trying to be original but still naming myself after something related to space
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
he made me face palm so hard
yeah that one's super hard
or given my personal rating
the nightmare was hard demon at one point
hotball1 is, to date, the only person who's ever beaten bloodbath on 60hz
<:lul:305559915714576385>
hotball is undoubtedly the best in the world right now
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
does that make sense?
i started acropolis when it was #45
wait
looks like java doesn't care master lul
half of my class dropped out thinking it was too hard in bluej
how would you plug that in?
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
also how long has java been running on exactly 3 billion devices?
youre lewd

who knows maybe back then since the robots were sentient memory meant their equivilant to our memory, or what we would consider storage
its fissioninig
which means almost all movies are sequels
as long as i have a drink with me for anything over 95 lol
85 is perfect
man i wish i could play xenoblade now
<:doit:334014889137930240>

1. something happened and i got booted out of character creation before i was done.
me too
two things
i could get work done
can i just put dog as background and then take picture of computer background and then email the background to a test ipad at apple and then email off of that to a bank so they can print it on the back of checks?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
why not just feed them to a dog
oh wait no thats just the weather balloon thats on fire. the sky isnt on fire
problem solved
but hes made of alcohol
ateveryone who here's life isnt a dumpster fire?
i thought everyone did that
that's slightly cheaper than my car
oh wait
ok, i got to sleep now
at least he didnt lose it
someone said luigi x mario?
~~greetings and salutations, gummy! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!~~
gummy record a xenoblade chronicles lets play

oops

gummy you forgot the part where flubs and i set fire to things
that'll be refreshing
that sounds even worse
and i have the one thats just a shell with kenobi's face on it
be peaceful
i mean we've known about it for almost a year so i would hope there's something
that wont wake her
gummy run

*kinda*?
that doesnt make you any more sane
mu is a pokemon
no please my brother help
yeah close enough on the zeroes
oh no you dont
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
why are you giving a math lesson to flubs? and flubs, it’s “mew”
when was i supposed to learn this shit
i blame the english majors for making a shitty api
```
but its fun to learn
thats like the last science i paid attention during
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
fun conversation. now to figure out why rotating the camera turns the world upside down.
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
which java defaults to
you gotta do so much to make them not gross
good night. be back in 3 minutes.
as opposed to the double-precision one
pretty sure most of us will have those mobs regularly attacking us, plus we can just grind a few golems into dust along the way
im back.
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue
and i wake up with my hand hurting. i think i slept on it
<:treason:396483914803445761>
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
28 left
it's great
yes, but then the trash will return and still need to be taken out

“press f for lamp”
agdq: very strict and thought out donation incentives, heavily vetted and pre-screened donations.
i saw team race, i didn't know they were doing battle mode, oh my god hype
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity
that chaos!
blazblue, why do i know that name . . .
and then went rogue.
i’d do it if i felt well
i really want to see what happens with the p.i. investigating to find lamp.
no. i dont even know what you gain from playing expert
there are terraria mods. i will go investigate this information.
it's much easier to keep track of.
oh no
and the boss health bar.
ah hah
also stuck, here's your message that you can't get to appear.
there now we all win
i'm was never hired
i was, but it passed.

happy revenge of the 5th everyone <:kappa:374346980136058893> is that even a thing? my friend who loves star wars said that so it must be, it oughta be.
whelp.

sooo yay
or is that our supply of kiwalas
do teachers know
he was saving it for a party tonight
ya know some people just overeat like normal people
i don’t he will even get suspended
i can confirm, boyfriend punching is a great pastime.
not that
i have no opinion i am romantically involved with a weakling
it shows what a great class we are
you should be happy
yeah either way it's messed up
i’m back from work ya ninnies
correct.
one less treasonous person to deal with
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
while also dressed in a modded chicken suit
my three month old mouse is having switch issues and keeps double clicking, fuck you logitech
it’s funny how you run, as it’s very distinctive, and i never said you were the cause of the loss
it seems we are at an impasse
so when does google make a nation and we end up in some dystopia where they own everyone
my tavernkeep in terraria is named blacksmith
do you what?
otherwise known as confetti gun fights
i love this
or something like that
for once you didn’t collapse something
oh grad party will be safe
also bagels are made with hot water apparently
mmmh
well yeah
it’s fun
and only assholes do that
i’m back from work ya ninnies
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
how so?
btw thats what the college catalog says^
i think that was just a general statement
hahaha
gummy what the fuck
unsigned bytes, rather
primitive types dont have methods
    }
so you do want to knowm
now the teacher walked in and he's talking about civ or something with one of the classmates
the gameplay ive seen on reddit kinda reminded me of just cause
i've been a pretty diehard fan of far cry for a while
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
thats asshole though right
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
thats true, maybe we'll get a gtavi within ten years then
but rdr2 is on the horizon so they're gonna swap ~~cash cows~~ games
this was a repeat of what happened two years ago
because only high quality shitposts make it through
i kinda wanna frame it
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
i only have ever hugged you and ida in this server
what do you think?
nah rainy they were being crazy amount of bitch
shhhh
it's misty freaking out
it's 1:30 in the morning and i'm documenting my code
i'm not your guy, buddy
fuck
niht
yeah lets go with that
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
no, square the temperature
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
then you are safe
ive never thought about it
as long as eyan doesn't have startup issues
because if we update there's a damn good chance that something will break for nightshade
backward is not an option
same
when a hazel and another hazel love each other very much
reverse reverse
yeah fuck life
both
if(x && !x)
it's quite obviously flubs going in to ensure gummy trying to reunify everyone for the 4th era doesn't go south
if you get the "good" ending
uhuh
alright
what should you do if you accidentally got a magnet stuck inside your pc case
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
terrible rotator cuffs
and remember the left hand rule
and when's that?
yeah im not dead yet
something about technicians
go faster than camera take picture
you use these words
every flashlight flashes
the flash
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
what here needs modifying?
yeah, i think that’s important
and a keyboard
* what went wrong:
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
java vs java ee?
what do i need for that?
did some cable management and how at 100 mbps
slow clap
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
wanna make games with me and master?
lol bob the builder
tell the friend to make games too
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
you dont have it still?
i woke up at 6:30 for an ap exam
im a doof
now the "run" button is just not doing anything
real java meaning notepad++ and cmd/
if you go the long way instead of just using the formula theres like 80 points of fuckupability
welp
i cant remember how it works now though
also i hope they give me my score immediately because there's only 6 spots left in the class i want; there were 10 at the beginning of the week
i think 5-24-25 is also one
3+4=5
it's not
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
i like casios but the rest of the planet likes the texas instrument
same
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>, squid
i'm on second summer rn i think and have a whole herd of the fuckers
oh gorsh
but that costs 150000
and then just a fucking big ass square of farmland
why?
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
that seems like a bad strategy
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
hey bella
im just not gonna show up
proudspire manor is a nice house...
so far operation: one small thing is falling apart probably because it was a dumb idea
it was thanks to war that got me in this mess
i know
yeah we know
idk who to pick though
sometimes relationships just take time to heal, other times it may be for the best that they never do
and year 2 fall
the only gold level tool you really need is the pick.
as the game has no ending
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
watering can upgrades are the surprisingly nice ones tho
like doubling numbers
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
damn
theres those junimo huts you can get
it's not like the class is experimental
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
and hops are pale ale so youre wrong too rainy
its honestly luck of the draw
and those varieties being longer means theres more to put in there
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
why are you upvoting
riot hates pass phrases confirmed.
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
so no upset for you
my social interaction is with idiot customers at work
it was funny to watch though
yaya
and ok coworkers
ah shit
spoilers: everyone *except* jesus dies
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
since we have graduation first because they don’t want kids to worry about finals and grad at the same time
oh nvm he's playing empire lol
in a bed
~~phanpy.~~
and the bed
only one way to find out
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
i can and will suck a duck
stahp
because im a chivalrous gentlemen or some other bullshit sale pitch she used
~~three~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
it was only 20%?
wait that was 20%?
either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place
nom something
>_>;
hes getting further and further away
also master yoru coding style is abysmal
but like
you say that like i know what style is
at a grad party
2,000 feet minimum.
sorry drag am watching arrow season 1
gummy uninstall
borderline drunk
sorry to hear that
know what would be nice?
guys i screwed up my code
i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
everything
windows 3.1
<:lul:305559915714576385>
nah that cant be it
we're gonna need to insert some metal kidneys
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
so tonight i finally get to relax with empire
electric cars are the future
actually code that
wait until battery technology improves ida
that was exciting
way less pollution
i can truly live in the 18th century now
i hope youre charging them rent
man i love empire total war
yeah i know
we talked about the art of history
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
i want some more twisted ice tea
also met a new friend at the party
well i’m going to let my friend text soon
gummy alcoholic confirmed
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
but i never said i hated them
she is the only friend i made cry
gummy said ‘go screw yourself’ then smiled a little
and gummy's friend seems a little bit degrading, is there anything else that you'd rather have us call you?
$1.26 a liter
there you go
get one for everyone here too
perfect
obviously
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
what the skitty it's full of dog treats
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
oh thats benny's
also hes a lightweight
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
also gummy don't call your friend those things
i forgot my wallet and came home
the grad date was yesterday though
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
i paid him
unless you changed it
did the censor not work?
does she have a brother?
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
slow clap
smart bois
yall can laugh but i legit had a job in a lab one summer that involved an instrument called a "penetration penetroometer"
go for it
it's treason
is it all private?
go with 1 to not fall into their r/fellowkids shit
people
oh yeah gummy
my final english grade is 96% :v
people just sub
especially for the books where your teacher has read them and interpreted them differently than you.
oh i'm in 11a, 10r was nice
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
blugh people are annoying
i didnt like those computerized tests
what is condom snorting
i mean i've tried interfaces first hand and that explanation still doesn't help anything make sense
you need to plug them into the coaxial outlet with the xlr switch enabled
there's at least two in my colossal cave adventure knockoff that i sent you a few days ago
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
check for "this is a prank" on the lottery token
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
it’s legit
no i thought i won...but i was literally on off...

~~or you could just be yourself~~
a game?

well i accidentally invited my favourite mod to my new server
she’s super cute
no idea what that is
and suddenly it goes from cloudy to pouring in 5 seconds
they axed it in 2014
ok next is the trumpet blaring from the sky

holy shit
e gadd?

and then you decided to edit and ruin it
well i can't change it on mobile sooo x d
<:gwcfcthonk:357907199928041473>
nice
in java decidedly not
ouo!
well it isn't
yeah, i checked myslf after i was off by  like 0.1 or so
master have you looked at libgdx yet
mfw i can take math126 and math127 both over the summer 😮
_shakes fist at the skyy
he does still occasionally stream on twitch.
outage
in theory: yes
in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
yeah, you didn’t get the joke dragonite
ok i have 40 minutes of photo transfers left to do
night
whenever my (great?)grandparents were high schoolers
no probably going to copy paste chant du départ and change some words
currently counting 435 photos
~~tacos are too overrated to be in a national anthem~~
now you can use them for food preparation
that sounds like the villain from splatoon 3
no bella no...
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
1930s?
that won't end well
update: real life sucks. who wants to talk about video games?
you people arent very good at this
(－‸ლ)
the one about clocks or something
they don't curse in this movie but they changed words up
i keep seeing people spawning in with an obviously cheated in amount of coins
gomme sounds like a devil fruit
again?
i am glad i changed a few words
i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
try this
mee6 disapproves.
oh fuck maybe
but yeah sing that song
<#305548986155008000> plz
then build damage, fuck atma's

christ, i'm just not going to, this shit has happened multiple times in league and it's never ended well
fuck i’ll fix it on pc
back to work
and awesome holidays
i just have the server frozen
all the males with legs
no bad apple
im perfectly happy on my own
and also it makes me a better singer
its a wonderful group to laugh at because you know they'll be sad and alone forever
also i needed the territory of egypt which was own by the ottoman empire at that time so instead of declaring war and taking it, i did it the ida way
so i think the year my mom hit 18 they upped it
and i'll agree hex maniac is top tier, but we can never have enough big titty goth gfs
you heard the man gummy
i guess that makes sense
your youth or your life as payment
that seems fair to me
sneak 100
i should sleep
but now i'm a higher enough rank than her that we can no longer play competitive together
rip lol
~~do you need to get hit with a tranquilizer dart?~~
no squid
squid you can be the guru of the gutter
unless we get like 1000 members, we probably won't have more than 3
96% on my geometry final :v
no rainy
not from family but from my community
lol true
greetings, will.
oh, wait i forgot that was a good yoyo, i think i might've tossed one -.-
seems about right
it's a great song though
or are we legit just waiting for eyan
and i only accidentally summoned wof twice
i switch between new saves and my main all in one
but let's be really nice about it so when he wakes up he doesn't feel any negative emotion about it
*noms cooking* <:roofat:399827527864025088>
so, is eyan dead or still asleep? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
hello
<:fat_think:330657519309422592>

he's also playing terraria.
or flubs
also, lol rc
<:sneakylul:337886705468047360>

it was a very simple math class lol
stick figures fte
im like
guys i have a major issue...
since when do i want to read?
sounds like me trying to teach mom to play portal
i will smite thee
fool.
i was just about to ask them

anyway sleep now bye
flubs im getting too old

me getting old made me lose my throne
you missed the dumpster
drago can i borrow $30?
(yes my new emote worked)
they are great
i can’t handle compliments from you
```js
youre great
is there still a potential stream today?
don’t be angry
at least until the sun comes out again
but ugh
the l word
next week's stream is scheduled for saturday instead of the usual friday.
i wonder if i can set my discord game to "discord"
not here

10/10 would make that mistake again

the dude who has a bone and the dude that is actually just his soul
look, there’s only one set of bones
(◕ ε ◕)
sets their bones on fire
i only explored like 30% of guar plains
the banished
god now i wanna see a twenty video long series of drago dying in a game. no context, no explanation, just you dying over and over and over
rii vah
1080p60 will do that to you
that's probably because shadowplay doesn't record at like a terabit per second
you very much can, drago
ive only edited like fifteen or sixteen btw
i use 1080p60 for mine too but use shadowplay. stuffs a lot smaller
thats no fun
anything higher than 50 will probably be overkill
your spleen hole is bleeding so much you must know something
what does bitrate even change
idk what it is but it smells nice
oh like taco style of bowl?
she got me some fish bowl
stabbing someone isn’t nice <:fluttershyscared:447198814747492352>
the hell
my worst joke:
good luck
or was some homeless guy hungry?
how many bits per second the thing uses to encode video
lasagna
well you are new to me, so, salutations
i’ll be a war teacher
but not 100% sure

i didn’t even finish my 7th grade sewing assignment
kangaroos in science class would be awesome

he can be like "here's how you dont do it"
yeah dragonite birthed you, skarm
what are you gonna do
fuck you im the assassin
does the school of zeal have a dark brotherhood chapter?
idk if someone wants to teach despacitounge or surrenderspeech

do people even use that term anymore
r/tumblr is my shit

that's what google said
idk how to do that in discord though
i don't see anything wrong with the math though
darn
i should probably do the same, night all
well, i think i got a cold or sinus infection or something. yesterday, i couldn’t stop coughing and today, my nose won’t stop running
good news i have a way with words
on the subject of this school thing, i have made the executive decision as head of the gsa: gsa stands for gay shit ayylmao now
you wanna be part of gay shit ayylmao?
nah, only requirement is that you laugh at a gay meme at some point
oh boy i have to be proctored for a final in an hour and 20 minutes
whatever floats your goat
except that one that rainy posted
never saw that show but heard good things about it, lol
okay im a general
it’s alternate history
it makes me pass my classes
new informatiin
that wasnt even a pun
diamond seems like the fan favourite though
then no further questions
its when youre social or something
guys code red
but i could
or something of the sort
do it
that's pretty <:roopog:442070287769403402>
probably closer to like 7-8 months, but yeah.
oh, that's the bitch i get to stab, irght?
either way works lol
not as much
i missed the old me
at the very least i was lurking in here when you were talking about it <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
i'm always hiding from someone <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
i hate algebra <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
nice
thanks
can you ask her to let me finish my finals first
why the fuck does nobody include the vocative case in their data
at least that's why i don't
yeah
because it bothers you
but if im being completely honest this science course was very good
get sarah to beat him then
or drink yourself super sick and use that miserable morning as fuel to be sparing
yes rainy?
used to hate autumn but now i love it
i just like autumn because i get to wear all of my favourite clothing <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
i can get behind this last statement
also hot coffee on a winter morning is the only reason i'm not 100% atheist
why not
were you just gonna uber everywhere? <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
gas is expensive btw
rainy with the creative names
but im playing games and stuff right now
thank you!
and my allergies got really bad
my favourite being the 22 death enemy sona saying "np"
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
why not
no it just hurts
we just need a place to host and some sort of teleportation device
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
yeah thats how it works
he did like a couple weeks ago but not since then
i still can take the inverse of functions and boring stuff like that
man i love war
actually that's not true
if you know what that means
sounds lame
im taking two english classes this summer so yes i am quite dead indeed
sleeping early was 3 hours ago
18 incidents, 3 systems
flubs flubs
what'd you do this time
good times
only if it's our favourites <:rooez:399827519286542336>
im just staring at emotes on my server
how was it a good idea?
so we start at around 12040 bc ish?
feel free to tutor me in math <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
man i love mods
i made it myself
listen to war music
<:gwnanamilaceshrug:403295147892277249>
well a lot of stuff happened a while back which caused me to have to retake a bunch of classes
...yeah started drinking at grad party and now all i can think about it trying everything that’s alcoholic
i technically have to be somewhere at 10:30 tomorrow but i got like nineteen hours of sleep today so i should be good right
gummy stop making me stay up
feels like i never talk to you guys anymore
im kinda glad that i'll be starting class next tuesday because going a couple weeks without a math lesson i dont really feel right
invade russia in the winter
i know how to by passed the system
i’ll go invite him to my friends server
i don’t wanna be napoléon anymore tbh i only wanna be him when i play my war games
man, i had some crazy pizza dreams last night, tripped the heck out
now i kick my pants off discord
how do you not eat bacon
over 3200 pages
back to war
but rum
oh i found it
from my point of view what about the wookies?
uh-huh
well that explains why everyone got all happy when i told them i gave up my title
i mean let's be real, xc1's menus are awesome considering the stupid amount of things that they do
no you dont lose your skyrim license, just your bard college position
how about a septim? wait, make that two septims, i feel like living it up
oh there once was a hero named ragnr the red
if you find out let me know too i was wondering that
i have no idea how they got that
i pretty much just guess since 3/4 were correct
so i was actually going to do something productive but napoleon total war is calling me
but napoleon total war
i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol
gonna start an invasion of the austrian empire
history is better
i still want to do a graybeard run some day
i took one class on it at uni
that makes me an expert
dammit, i wanted that
i liked barbas more than clavicus, even if his ai is rock dumb
i did all of them, i'm pretty sure
sadly i wouldn't know very much about that, lol
i used to hit my head against things a lot
rueful axe
also a shrine
one of my geometry teachers never really made jokes often but this one joke i still remember and recite like everyday
“do you know the definition of insanity?” vaas
since i was considered dangerous and capable of defending myself
ask ida on that one
i just hate stupidity, in both myself and others
i dont really hate stupidity, i hate ignorance. because ignorance can make you look really stupid
strengthen the empire, weaken the thalmor
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
i'm funny like that
the stormcloaks wouldn't be able to face them
and the nm pays good money
modern rap is like saying classical music
who said anything about needing to dance to like edm
what category is pony music in?
and it gives you a source of dispensable npcs
who chooses that side
also anthems and game music
speaking of which i need to go listen to god save emperor francis again brb
how about chant du départ
that was a good song/anthem
then why side with him if you're gonna betray him anyways?
definitely a country load
i haven't gotten my smithing that high yet
they make such satisfying noises when they die
i see falmer, i think chaurus, and become scared
and just took the forsworn with it
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
that's hakon you fool
it's just my phobias make the game hell for me
welp a 15 minute talk about math with my dad turned into an hour and a half debate about god
awoo
i say nay
bad news, they want to kill me now
that doesn’t **add** up <:kappa:374346980136058893>
yes they're correct in every way
oh hey gummy, hows the windchime?
don’t you mean wahter? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
good
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
a tnt a day keeps the doctor away
i just don’t care about action movies. except maybe deadpool
and to answer that question majestic i like both
hey that’s ben’s money
when you encounter trainings whilst surfing, obviously
fuck
either way ive pretty much stopped paying attention
probably less so after steel got nerfed
remember when i pirate stuff
oh hey i got my id, thanks dmv
or hit shift then = hat works sometimes
the krabby patty secret formula
guys
i t-posed on people a lot today
i knew something was up
fire emblem hates you o3o
so i may have just invited a pedo to my server 🤦
and stuff
so i found out he just got ban from that server
```that item does not exist. it may have been removed by the author.```
yeah, i set them to private by mistake
i took some steam screenshots, how can i find them?
"wingardium leviosa"
i’m actually eating right now
like the 14.5th?
“snowing” his phone? there’s snow on it? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
that makes no sense
go home
wow gummy
met a french friend yesterday
sticking little easter eggs all over the audio tracks
you just need to make a 4-6 min video on why ben franklin should be in the hall of fame
he’s going to help me learn french
i’ll send you this for free
n(n+1)/2
that was fun
i got a b in bio in 10th grade

dreams do come true
but still, i only really enjoyed one class
rc let me introduce you to this thing called a "microsd chip"
but, i really enjoyed it
i dont own a car
we are not enabling the bot to post memes
someone called me earlier. i didn’t answer, but he left a voicemail saying he wants his money back and then bye
same
tell them to turn it off and turn it on again
it was an automated message <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
except i think some people might get pretty pissed off at being inducted
if benny is illiterate how could he play the slots?
i should call gummy to get him over here
can you give your friend the line?
you called me in the middle of work...
or next time i speak french
got it
just let me verify
indian/russian whatever the fuck it was
you do know thelastsane right?
sane was the annoying one right
know him? i remember killing him
whats his username now?
but im not sure as of now im still looking it over
assuming that group gets picked on the first 30 rolls
sure it does
i've only done 2 chapters on statistics so i may not be the best person to ask for help, lol
like you'd expect there to be fewer people with six dogs than people with one dog
i dont remember that but it feels like something i'd do
i knew how to solve that at one point in my life
i did this
they're the awkward cousin of algorithms
silly goose? have you ever met a goose? they will ter your world assunder
screw them
nice job squid
thats not even an answer choice, squid, lol
oh yeah someone from my group dm decided to send a pic of her butt and yes it was covered so it wasn’t inappropriate or anything but i was still stunned
more math
to answer your question, she doesnt like sheep very much
nah he hates golf
chucks radio at rc
noms tv
<:lul:305559915714576385>
lost
benny is like the second mascot here
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
early sleep
at this rate. someday you'll have the courage to take over europe
one mistake napoleon made was at the battle of borodino
im practicing already rainy
and no, the expos never won one
near the end of the year algebra 2 lessons took me on average 2 - 3 hours to fully master and digest
yeah but with my current teacher the coefficient of fun is reduced tenfold
i guess he didn’t like the rock
apparently the subscription tab will no longer be im chronological order
youtube has done it again...
brother's on the phone with grandma and he's in the process of having the same conversation for the fourth time and it's driving me mad
why would i need lock picks?
razelan?
just woke up
also i thought ida's game said "skype" for a moment
it's okay youre not supposed to be able to remember elven names anyway
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
also dropping subscriptions overall right now would probably be good as well
i never liked the guy but that's a shame :/
for a second, i read “yosuke” as “yusuke” and i thought “wait, you could give best p5 character a piggyback ride?!” <:kappa:374346980136058893>
is that nyan cat
this is pointless
head of the institute
friends decides to troll in server
what’s pride and predjudice?
don't sully that name by bringing it up here
used that 4 cheese-blend
wasn't there a song called reputation?
nice
and hey, i needed bones for my glove, might as well do it in the dungeon
the plane game was nice
#notmygeneration
brb looking for cheese
speaking of which i kind of want to play smash 3ds now for no reason
biology, who needs it
how about napoleon total war?
since everyone has a different role and in the same category
\`\`\`do this\`\`\`
i beat you in that
with a sawzall and a blowtorch
it is always the time for java jokes
no we don't need them
gummy, i've identified your affliction
you suffer from a condition called not nerdy enough
fortunately the cure is straightforward and easy to digest, you simply need to spend five or more hours on /r/programmerhumor every day for a month and you should be cured in no time
"i could spend nineteen hours a day breeding and training pokémon that i might use once or twice a month"
yeah far
hello kugal
though the mod that is like drago over in the another server does
what?
but it was something stupid
nvm master
i dont remember that but that thought got a chuckle out of me
what did i do
the russian empire sucked after tsar alexander i died
it's exactly like smash
that's a surprising thing to hear from you
you called it
nothing happens
nothing?
ww1 one page and was just about canada
because
good job skarm
also was asleep 2.5 hours before you sent that
~~so it's fresh in your mind~~
just got done golfing. now waiting for lunch.
ever
id enter that except i can't be bothered to open up ultra moon
it ends on may 28
...*gives drago a fish*
am i?
“skarm is weird lol” nice pin
i hate how even the best questlines have an ending and seem to go by so much faster when you replay them
put poison on the bows, archery buff potion, and sneak/invis potions
you just put a kitchen in that house
you kind of deserve it for being a filthy traitor
do a no armor run
septimus singus has something to say about that
once again the asshole made me super mad
khaniit only, no items, final destination
so are we
i have something very nsfw for you gummy
i think i was caught up for a while but then i stopped paying attention and now i'm about three years behind
what did you get, dialga or palkia?
same but that is a good one
dialga
yeah, like that one guy
everyone here
gummy go spin on a spinny chair or something
why not have a paint concert or a lumber concert instead
drago
i oneshot the jhin and ekko lategame with auto and maybe an e
im about halfway through melting down cookies, garlic, and bread into my stomach, if theres anything extra stupid going on today please ping
maybe
no rap
wearing skirts above the ankles? society is doomed, i tell you! doomed!
so i got between one and a half and two hours of sleep last night
tempted to qupte monty python right now but i cant quite remember the line
but its 1
that's not addressed in the privacy policy.
just need to find my black lipstick and amethyst eye shadow so i can get in the mood
you don't need most of it
that's still 800 items each
i hoik killed a dungeon guardian fairly early on and then we legit killed another as a group lateron.
no watching nature
it’s 7:32 and i already feel like going to bed. help
now if he was into suffering he wouldn't of have a battle axe hovering over you right now
something about blue light
probably because javascript lets you do too many stupid things and would encourage bad programming habits early on
dp2 is almost starting soon
thank fuck
though i wish i did cape, i hate it when people mistake me for a *shudders* straight
well lord of the flies was dumb also
good
it was
finally something that doesn't make me regret coming to the theater 20 minutes after the start time
it took me a while that you were not, in fact, talking about diamond and pearl
spongebob is better now
simpsons has been going on longer
32 seasons i believe
wait the simpsons is still airing? i thought they killed that years ago
not too bad xd
oh shit dp is finally starting
thanks guys
still airing drago
i never actually watched that show. does it still have fans?
even if it was illegal i would still post it
i couldnt stand ash back in like season 1, where have you been
i think rc needs to hang out with gummy more
eighteen? he should be in his thirties
you haev weird friends
i still think he was 16 in x and y
damn i said cheese
now i want cheese
and once i find my mic i'll get on for what will probably only last until i either a) go meetup with friends to binge a bunch of shows or b) we decide to play the vidya games
welcome back demon lord, expect me to crash your party in the next 20 minutes
> dragonite
what foobar thing?
shush panda it's more fun to blame me
indeed
who was the asshat who called it foobar?
i am disappointed in his audience but i can't say it surprises me
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
did you try turning it off and turning it on again
it's more or less a religion thats one of those stereotypical ones i guess
guys on a serious note
sometimes i wanna disappear
i did a 7 hour stream yesterday of kingdom hearts
it's deja vu all over again
do you really not remember the name?
protip: don't take the story super seriously
no i don’t
either she is faking it or yeah
inebriated
did i say it was morning?
so my choices are be productive and happy, or be social, never both
flubs
/m,e hugs
the liars
now that my gym is open i'm back to 10-5 sleep schedule, which i really just love
the vi mains mod squad int squad
fkubs
so does that mean you hate me
just saw deadpool 2
was pretty good
i already know this
i call the english language the language of anguish
im seeing ads for barbecue and getting extremely hungry
sooooo
also the rest of yall really need to start posting creative stuff, i dont like being the only one who dumps stuff in here lol
do you want an example of how dumb it is?
something something lord of the flies
don’t get how most people like wild world more than city folk
wait really?
i get codes tonight
if it's written out you can decipher, at this point with speaking i don't think you could understand if they used spelling or grammar correcty
if you can make a sentence where the subject is not a noun, i will go drive off a cliff and forward the insurance check to you
flubs can you give me 10 examples of ideas that aren't a theory
flubs
that makes no sense
lol, day off, if only
i should probably talk here more
what separates an idea from a thing?
why does it feel like he never streams anymore
because i kind of want to start over again
its monday
god damn how is this 2 hour track still playing 5 hours later
~~yourself?~~
every day?
have fun with that
god damn it how am i still in the lead?
and i was asleep until 2pm so its even shorter for me
i don't either
ida!
was today?
memorial day
well then back to yelling at people for pinging other people
flubs you gotta watch this amazing show that i am currently watching
what?
power rangers
cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
i just meant like a ceasefire
camelot 2.0 is falling apart because i hesitate on decisions
sleep
hopefully you wont have to learn bluej but the only thing you need to know is how to public static void main
your bagels will be stole
very carefully. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
~~did you spend all your money drinking?~~
*our* money, comrade
~~i think skyrim is going to be on your phones now~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
"we here at bethesda are updating our privacy policy"
does dragonite not like bluej
im pretty excited just to dive into calculus
nope shes just sleeping next to the window
then i can get into differential equations
like linear algebra, number theory, topology, etc
my university offers a multitude of stuff though
differential equations fascinate me, i wanna learn about those eventually
if i put the same effort into my other classes like i did math i'd be amazing at everything in school, lol
a time machine
my ap history course for next year just assigned their summer project
it was invented when a supercomputer was injected with 12 tons of meth, 3 tons of weed, and a pool-worth of lsd
im just excited to read napoleon in america
~~there are 20 pancakes~~
~~who doesn’t?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
not the best, but also not terrible
did someone say bluej
like last day of notes and drafts taking the last page
what have they done?
okay, now that i think about it, lets go is gen 1
my *only* issue is that this is generally the time in the yearly cycle that they start to hype up a main series game
bleh
also we finally get to start with eevee
that'll actually make picking between the two versions a lot more meaningful
yup looks like it
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
i wanna come back to fun stuff to read
buy a tv
so i just decided to make a text adventure rpg and implement sound
because gum doesn’t ban
complete waste of money to get both
actually get sarah to do it
and tries to help reform them instead
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
which kinda sucks too since i kinda need to rely on a phone to be in contact with my parents to know where to go after my lecture today
i'd assume the zoomed in radio beginning is to signify that this is a main game, not a complete spin off
did someone say javascript
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
well shoot, ok
but i don't know much javascript.
but only one version
but you guys never talk when im here
if we’re taxing people now...
good job twitch (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
e!will
oh speaking of which
because i have no idea how to make an algorithm that will do this
on a scale of one to stupid how stupid would "exploding footballs" be for a weapon type?
when i was in middle school i had a comic where one of the characters was a chicken who played sports
make up ya minds, gamefreak.
nice
time lapse snapshot
i throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~hole in the wall~~ window
and yes dragonite i put sovengarde and the normal main theme both on there
ok so old format still works
its too chill for my chillstep list
i once won the jackpot on a deal or no deal game at an arcade
so at the beginning, i picked our case
and we kept saying no deal
i played through firered several times and most of yellow once
nah i don't have a gba anymore
no idea.
hai friends ^w^
i was in a squid?
well my first ever book i own
been a little while since auto pin kicked in
must not damage the pages
oh yeah
did you even hear a word i said
well fuck
it appears he did not.
c—a—n—a—d—a
if anyone actually wants to see footage of my exploding footballs let me know, otherwise i won't waste space in the creative channel with it lol
what’s 2+2?
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
hey master how do you say "football" in dovahzul
eyan is starting the sequel to jersery shore
just unbind it and use the one on the mum pad
i would be done if they made it too casual
ida has 132 hours on record in skyrim currently
e!google shannon selin
particularly if theyre building a new engine and not forking an existing one (which they did for gens 4 and 5)
not surprising
forgot about that one
oh wait do you mean one that i actually use?
meh i hate how all my plans have changed
i think this is the 3/4 time
i did once
when i wake up in the morning, i instinctively look on discord and youtube.
have fun with the penguins, flubs
i was going to say flubs' current missiles are probably more explodey but i guess not
wanna trash talk it?
(－‸ლ)
i second this.
exploding footballs break?
brb food
"2018"
today's lecture was awesome because we weren't over a pretty important detail in calculus and im super eager to take calculus
so i was happy about that
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
push up half way you can do it
how bout, no
and with that im gonna go get some more
is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
n = o/u
he said music was gross
no pink
as long as my pink is unchanged i couldnt care less
oh no
bc i have reason to
flubs you always join when im around
yeah because my voice is fabulous <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466>
haven’t had to use failfish in a while
~~does this mean rc needs to get taxed too?~~
everything looks the same....
and <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
had to rewatch my stuff and i did do a good job
i'm sitting here uploading july's videos because that's how far ahead i work because i'm stupid
hmm what to pick
he isn’t really my friend just a classmate
that's a little bit gross
but didn't you already graduate
i guess
time for new friends yes
she has all of that besides science but she got an exception and she probably will pass her finals however she has two online classes that she is not done and if she doesn’t get them done she doesn’t get a diploma
i used to get called out of class just so i could go and study for it, it was bullshit
racist
is it possible to finish 4 units of grade 11 not grade 12 computer science in 22 days?
it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
cool...if only the military was like what it was once wa
work
no if you dont know what youre doing
back in the old days everyone wanted to join the army
i must say, it is rather amusing to be looking for an enemy that turned invisible and then finally when they turn visible again they're having a seizure on the floor due to the paralysis thing
drago give me cooking advice
oh yeah, it's officially gay month
relatable
boy were they wrong
and you arent even told what is incorrect,just that it is "incorrect"
usually
should be
im vlogging now guys
i mean aside from the fact that you can only play online in 7 and 8, and 7 is pretty much dead
im doing a rare editing stint so ill join later, probably
join
i wonder how effectively i can do both at once
sarah is a fucking psycho. she ate into an ice cream...sideways. she broke through the top on one side and worked her way down and to the opposite side. it looks so weird.
what
im gonna work on this spreadsheet for like 10 mins and then bother gummy about starting up another conversation
besides i'll do it tomorrow
missed the rest of stream, apparently. oh well.
since i am free tomorow
i broke through the part on the left but still
oh ok
i give it 10/10
well the other night i didnt get any sleep
so i would have to show photo id and all that jazz and yeah i may never get the account back or i might get it back
nice
so after work
also that separation makse sure you dont have any of the old stupid or edgy shit you put on the old one
quinn
albino umbreon
im going to yell at people today
just in case i never get it back
exactly. games are a form of art
i have to work later. right now, nothing’s happening
this was a dream, now?
so apparently im in charge of a vc tonight
your music taste sucks
noms natewantstobattle
gummy stop hating things
gummy be nice
that song is describing me piece by piece
and basically ruin it
i'm one or two shy in almost every direction but i don't think i actually have any bingos
that counts
something tells me deino is lying on his
k thats fine
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i want to sleep, but i dont want to sleep
primaries
new jersey
good job
gummy i thought i told you to leave your fishing pole at home
b/c vc
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
is it rozen's skyrim album
wanna join>
im also here but in a different call with friends
i did it because i was in a rarity mood
you should know im a brony
um pimaster
for some people it is
anyways where was i?
random rare drop
personally, for me i would never even bother with the dock if there's a cable charger
what year/season?
im no private to you
and bring it into the illuminati triangle in the desert
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
yeah blame drago
real fans root for teams that haven't won the world series since before they were born
gross
there you go
right person, you thought wrong
and only 1 line of ghost and dragon types; i never liked that
especially on short answer
i honestly don’t like muk
i love latin though
fiddlesticks
because those are funny
i got the diploma at the same time as the medal
“drago’s boil water”
i should change my name to something offensive
what level honors did you get?
im tempted to go dig up the thing
pr. is one day before, after that its x days before
i probably shouldn't get too far into it but to give you an idea there was one hitler fan a few months back
they were like "the sun moves over a day"
for me
they counted years by the two consuls they had that year, re-elected years were weird i guess
she is my official helper now
taking latin 4 next year then ap latin
omg your overlay sucks
just um dumb sometimes
i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future
unfortunately, i missed this friday
and overlay
probably no because that would require doing an e!all and discord will probably send a hitman after me if i do that one more time
temportal nightshade
a good assassin relies on air existing around them
im a rogue with max dexterity and proficiency bonus in stealth. no one catches me
but a ton of people got cum laude
the infinity stones have two parameters
if not vision of them
hence parameter in your lungs
and it's 4:30 so it's because i'm an idiot
oh memes are weird
ehh, not a fan of doimg this
can it be done in java?
my bot is being developed in java.
nah just make it less spaghetti
(long pause)
does it not use events?
okay another issue with discord.js: the documentation is trash (at least on mobile)
good job
i dont do it for the server. i do it so that only i can have onii-chan's love
yeah
okay the d.js stuff is now refusing to load on mobile
and we learned how to graph them on a graphing calc

bella we are nerding
brb gonna get some ribs
they were the only one that's mentioned it thus far.
java
shh questioning it only makes it stronger
i didn’t even know their was a dm in youtube
yeah you guys will have no idea where i got this name from
be more specific
tempted to change it to "rc's love life" now
subway!
mommy works too
i was going to make an overwatch reference and then realized i dont know any of those characters except dva and tracer
guess who i said
nice
"speak softly and carry a big stick"
i really wanted to say ivan the terrible though
out of the whole list of heroes he was the oldest and well an interesting choice
we can talk about platinum
while some people wrote boring things like hockey player
rc gets what life is all about
im msging someone to ask for a price for a plush
brb sleep or something i guess
they make frantic gestures, they cant cough even though they are clearly trying, and/or they fall unconscious
what’s the meaning of life?
i wrote down i was emperor, huge warlord, have absolute power, and my wife is rarity
is anyone else not seeing comments on youtube videos because of "restricted mode" even though restricted mode is off
hai friends ^w^
id make a darwin project video but it doesnt work well with shadowplay
love how rc said don't go overboard
well yeah
i am making bios for each pokemon lol
it's currently the stupidest thing i am ever doing
well you said something like thta
i tried it at the beginning of one lp; too much work; i stopped doing bios at episode 4
why?
im bored
and he has help from stephen (photoshop) and masae (art)
well looks like im a pillow now yat
yeah i assume it was you with that one as well lol
asshole 2 is blocked
as a definitely oppressed gay, i demand these shoes for free
no but he pinged me telling me my name was mentioned
im bored and there are all of three other people in the room
garchomp and vaporeon as well
how'd research on d.js go?
(sarcasm)
i've seen ads on neither cause a) i use adblock and b) i don't use twitch
so are they advertising homophobia?
yea lul
"hello, i like money" - youtube
save me
fine then.
i have teachers to be bothering about summer things to do
reading that sounds like work
since my original plan was helping eyan get youtube back on track but it seems like thats delayed til at least years end
dammit
no thats star geezeers
because it's an essay put to relevant video
horseradish mustard too
for a video essay it would
she went through a 16 ounce shaker of that powder parmesan cheese in less than two days
but like, does she just eat it with a spoon, wtf
is that saurkraut?
*cheese* is good
this dehydrated milk and sodium blend is not
cheese is good
by refusing to skip
whats wrong about senior skip day?
they apparently don’t want kids to worried about finals and grad so they do grad first
students
anything that is 50% or over is a pass
but it’s nearly impossible to fail here
and im quite sure that the failing grade was a 65
in my college, d, you pass but the credits don’t transfer
no because she won’t be done her computer science class flubs
ohhh i see
she has 5 units of computer science left so she can’t pass that
she might fail gym so 21...
whats your version of dont give a crap?
dude iss is the best
you cant punish a student who doesnt give a shit about school
anyways time to go back to platinum work
for us
darn asshole can’t vc with me while i film
yeah, theyre looking at their phone. how would they know someone is talking to them if they arent listening?
fiver or something
or youre missing the button
its just that everyone in school is an asshole all the tiem
i havent been bullied since 6th grade, which also happened to be the last grade i stayed in a public school setting
that's how little i cared about socializing
in elementary that is
hey drago
isnt shulk the zelda but a dude person
wanna add me?
im gonna stop doing that one day
how convenient
flubs do i have you on steam
help i forgot to switch onto my non-speedrunning version of the game
one requires 100% headshots on enemies that teleport randomly in a game with bad hitboxes
its so glitchy d:
and its so good to kill in it
we lost to the toilet of the major leagues
come on
whatever happened to that bad self-insert fanfic you were writing a while ago?
who goes the the cloud district often now?
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
the marlins is the team that have no good players and are magically doing better than the m—never mind
psst, i know you who are. hail sithis
this time i said something along the lines that she would get fired less than a day
i am always busy now
damn thats pretty...okay
gummy i like you a little more than the bubble gum stuck to my shoe but less than brussels sprouts
woah
the point of me being here is to annoy everyone
only here master
you only do public insanity?
when i am serious almost everyone gets scared of me
they are talking about star wars
i made that avatar in like a minute and a half and im proud of it
i dont feel like logging in on browser though
youre boring
in xenoblade or pokémon or skyrim
well if all the singers do it then its a part of the song
flubs sing a song
the singer just fucking slows down mid word
i been in war with this person for way too long so must get a peace treaty
dragonair and ????
how does that make an relative sense?
mine: 
more work
i just build the houses
work
go home
it would make things more interesting
oh, that’s my day tomorrow
45 seconds in them: "alright please stop we'll remove you from the list"
posted a thing in blackbird
and that game uses a butt ton of real songs
that’s why i said i **had**
i have no idea what to do all summer
i mashed 1
being an idiot here
"3d printer"
check back in like a month once i actually get some of these things carried over
hmmm
wait i made a list
not if youre all thumbs
idk master is the guru of names
i have to smash it against my desk until it comes apart by divine intervention
bleeeeeeeeh
truly the ultimate pokemon adventure
do stab and boom at the same time, booab, or stoom, whichever floats your goat
see he's ready
bring a flashlight
i don't see skarm fighting for glory, i see him fighting for no reason other than to say hey look at me mom
and i like to pretend to be him
i'm biased, it has the word princess in the title
tastes like licorice
weapons of steel and no armor
at this point, nothing is original anymore
rip i can't change my server nick to "dragonite - guru of life and laziness"
~~#needmoreyuri~~
and my profile pic
he misses being aggressive
rc you suck
yeah otherwise gummy would be running around with a picture of upside-down rabbits also
or 4
12 more days until the old gum turns 18
for high school math classes i've been using composition books with 100 sheets (200 pages total) and for college math i've been using 200 sheet (400 pages)
that seems like too much
and im hungry
im watching the news about a killing husky
is that right outside the window?
yeah, watch your goddamn language
actually
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
im not named brad
thats not squid nvm
also did you level up recently?
while master is doing teh maths im also doing math lul
nah already completed my required 2 years, but i'll still get up and exercise like i do so i dont die young lmao
also did my precalc final exam today
at my school, you had to take 3 years of gym
im still on the fence of whether gym is evil hellspawn of satan or a fun time for all
kill him
the majority don’t try at all
im lucky enough unpaid gigs count as service
and like three hours later i came up with a great comeback on my way home and i was so happy
yea.
the <:kappapride:379352530863521792> pe teacher
today is international jelly donut day
i love me some jelly filled donuts
want to do it to him?
for...reasons
bully
get over here
things i do to watch the new pony episode
fuck now you give me flashbacks to that sheep song
burn him
now i need to watch eqg shorts, finish tmnt, finish justice league action, catch up on teen titans go...im missing a show
and the color depth is amazing.
beep boop
i dont believe so
huh, no scratches. i should go play with the rabbit again today.
i didn’t
woah is that pixelkmon
went with the new york
bottom one master
the blue jays are winning but it's against the orioles so it doesnt count
no no
idk how to read baseball scores
they are 3rd in al east
oh rip that was yesterday's game
i know
brb now food
yeah the orioles beat us in both games gummy :^(
i meant the commies
wait why is flubs in the enlightend
i'm teal you fools
<:doit:334014889137930240>
well too bad
the russian army mostly had peasants as troops, they only had 200,000 regulars
actually eh
five chairs
now you can
no flubs
you can't tell the future? what are you? a level 17????
flubs is a race
i clearly have minecraft open right now >:(
ban yasuo
(just testing stuff)
i’m killing rabbits in minecraft pe version
but i wanna go to 3 places only available in certain states
fast food
wont this just slam my face into the ground
who said we were driving?
i got her bugged in the one dungeon with the tiny platforms on the shaft downward
wont this just launch me upwards and then into a spin where i then slam my face into the ground
she was still following me in boolean but was stuck on the platform for like 80 load screens
thank
it's awesome
squid you're slacking on your job, you're supposed to give out baconators to people
hi persom
pokes fish
i just got back onto discord
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
wow, gummy just got destroyed
again
gummy stop getting deatroyed
olay! wait wrong country
wait squid i could ve sworn your pictire was flippee
meaning of life? not worth it
my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
im not : (
microsoft and bethesda
jokes on you i'm on summer break
the only people who dislike each other here is drago and me
it was the rival nickname thing in crystal/soulsilver
slow clap
who said emile is here?
i don’t think anyone said he was here
anyways where was i?
i think sumo was kind of a last straw for him
and then questioning why he's doing any of that work
he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
same.
stop making me feel old .-.
he used to do various video games
with the whole "the only people here"
then he went exclusively minecraft and i stopped
pipe down gummy
hi bedridden im dad
why did they change that
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
its not that he doesnt like pokemon
i'm actually charles babbage's analytical engine
and a gf thats helping with the depression but makes the youtube comeback take a bit longer
beep
yeah!
!leaderboard
dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
someone said johto
okay thats it brb
unfortunately yes
some of them are for pink nus, others are eyan memes
good job master
socks are hard ok
you don't put a blanket on, your put in over you
dont get dragonite started on faces
most of us do
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
(◕ ε ◕)
blankets are easy
but i already said that about the 5 emotes
blah blah blah /rant
it does if you ask nicely
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
woah now no need to cuss
hush it you
i honestly dont know what that means but good job
since i essentially finished it today lol
flubs
except for the updates
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
after this, i won’t be looking forward to anything until nintendo
i feel like nintendo will either blow everyone out of the park or be a bigger disappointment than ea
crap i gtg do real life stuff for a bit, ping me if bethesda does anything actually interesting
okay bethesda legends isn't the same as tes6
i love steak, it is great, and when made right, is even better
aqua
that's a dragon priest
i feel like theyre gonna pull something
i mean im happy and all but why
aqua
like last year’s nintendo e3 presentation when pokemon for the switch was announced
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
plus the *obscene* amount of money gtao made, i'm surprised we hadn't seen a clone yet
because porting skyrim to the pip boy was just too hard
i died when he said "iiz slen nus" and ice fell out of the freezer
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i don’t see you declaring war on countries for no reason and looting cities
squid im going to have to euthanize you for that 9ne
after i beat them, it was like do you wanna loot or peacefully occupied?
drago
thanks
ironically, this announcement has increased my desire for pancaks
<<no i'm just a good liar~~
and when they do they start doing dumber and dumber shit
misc. stuff
the fuck you mean 3 am?
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
ooh where?
welcome to our domain
welcome
hello there
we’re a small group
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
and yet i still dont get any of the stuff i should be doing done
its a very fun game
master you officially have too much time on your hands
gummy i swear to fuck if you burn down the pantheon
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
sooo in corphish’s server he has me listed as youtube friends along with other people. this one apparently has heard of everyone under this category but me
honestly it mightve been in utah. ive been to utahs capital and one other town north of that i cant remember the name of
beef?
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
ive had kool aid
the fuck is *that8
that’s exclusive
12 pm
and really shitty
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
but just dont play with them
you can play wow by yourself too
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
at first i thought you were cheering for aquas questioning
there's always the vods if you can't watch it
but i need my analytics
ah. meant to type that into a different server. sorry.
like i need a really good excuse for not doing my paper
guys
or youll be alive, if you call that living
eating raw cookie dough is worth the salmonella
i just love this movie
sleep now or something bye
narcissism is directly responsible for all human caused suffering
gummy, i'm serious
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
people in the live chat on youtube keep saying fortnite and despacito
on switch
its been free
so if the defense mode is on switch, i'll be pretty content
yeah, i too dislike people hating or dissing on a game before trying it
happy birthday, bella.
cause clearly epic got *something* right
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
i think fallout shelter is too, right?
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
nintendo has won e3.
kumatora and boney in lucas' final smash
not in that order
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
to the trailer pref
but still i'm hyped!
fyck yeah
i'm not crying
smash is fun but i can only play kirby
that stage is one of the few things i remember about my childhood
i'm not saying the old ones don't matter. i'm saying i've seen what they offered and now i'm more interested in what's new
i'm a daisy main for life
and i'm going to stick with mario kart. and maybe mario party when it comes out
so critical hit (lucina and marth) will be the exact same, which is great cause they're me favourites
i mean, i liked sutherland, i think he did a fantastic job
and fortnite
or try to hit from far away
i was kinda hoping for netflix and youtube apps to be announced
i will burn it down
have a baconator newb 🍔
but cant he just not get the game
im going to loot everything in site
you'd think it would be that easy but apparently this little to-do has been raging for like a half hour now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
im confused
no part
fortnite is a sign of the devil is a new one, ill give it that
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
any idea what this thing it goes over in the beginning is ?
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
so, anyway
i don't think it was bad.
cake or ice cream?
i didnt like nintendo this year. nothing interested me
of course ive only seen like 4
yes why
devolver hosted a streamer i watch with like 20k people so i liked them this year
one thing i hate: es6 overshadowing the rest of the conference
i already played a bit of that
nope
yeah i mean no need to bash their fun
i’m pretty sure there won’t be as much story and stuff in it
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
it just was pointless at the same time
also i didnt play videogames in 2010 or whenever it came out
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
sometimes, it feels like i have so many unpopular opinions, it gives me a headache 😛
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
what about double dash?
i got a gamecube and xbox the same christmas
for not being faithful to the original
ct is the only major jrpg i've played through
the gamecube was my childhood
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
dude having a job is awesome. you can just...buy shit. its great. the not great thing is taxes and rent and food and medical bills and bs like that
86 years old
intel also showed off a liquid nitrogen cooler i think
do you know how many times i have to repeat how to use it? its fucking irritating
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
e3 was fuckin boring
the guy who you don’t want to mention?
one let’s player i watch will never play a pokémon game because he thinks the series is stale and repetitive
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
i get really into something for a couple months but then lose interest and not care at all
i think fan games were just part of my “rotating interests” 
good job 🎉
speaking of which 18 in one week
this guy gets it
tomorrow will be worse
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
what do you expect me to do with a bowling ball
kingcorphish
well im kinda not in the mood for jokes
my bot learns from the best
he probably feels ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
the bunny is drago and the crocodile is a brony friend
bug/ghost.
actually new orleans
i saw a simpsons clip of all the famous foods in new orleans
yeah but it only works if he stumbles over it a lot and just randomly pauses before really lackluster punchlines
they told me im obsessed with warfare
also, squid,
and flubs she isn’t a robot
it wasnt that hard of an exam, but still, it's my first college exam ever and im happy bout it
go to military school
*gives bella a yo-yo* have fun
54 miles to london
destroyed 8 ships and captured 2
my bday is coming up and i hate it
apple sucks, pc is better
muskets though
so, when does the splatoon 2 octo expansion actually come out? i already pre-ordered it, so i’m just waiting impatiently right now
why does it have to be an animal?
idk show me a plant or a bacteria with a deed
we own the land, we own the planet
nice
how can we own all plants
then what gives us the ability to claim ownership that the dinosaurs couldn/t
yeah people have to agree the land is yours. which you prove with a deed
well it hasnt
function flubslogic(){
    var a = a + 12 * (3^a)^2;
what does our agreement actually do?
```
ok, it looks like the octo expansion does have a midnight release. 😑
go there if you hate government so much
i think it’s out now; just checked twitter
woah the first assassin creed takes place during the third crusade
~~but they need inspiration for you know what~~
pfft
wow cant believe em. kappa
isnt that just calculus
aight cool tried four different emails and finally got it. thanks for letting me know when theres no account linked to the email, ea. love ya
haha, yup
not to mention the lesson was extremely confusing with backwards grammar rules
}
dragonite are you in the steam beta?
this is non beta steam library
i just wont eat for a day or two
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
can you buy things for me?
gotta say
<:lul:305559915714576385>
and that was a decoy house. for the times that someone might blow it up
i played it for a little bit this morning, but i had to go to work. and now, i have been catching up on youtube ever since i got home. now i can finally play more again
i am the warrior of jolly ranchers and you shall bow you little twizzlers
also i need someone to play world of warcraft with
who's reposti?
hes the real general reposti
his name is "gallowboob"
that name is ridiculous
you should get it, it's really fun but insanely addicting
well its also a species but thats unrelated
i thought flubs was a group of people
i love cold brew coffee
the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army
since the rest of my troops were in russia i was forced to sign a peace treaty...i hate the portuguese
i just remembered: i have a saxophone in a closet and i haven’t played it since 5th grade
i wish the characters in the train had more to say
i see ninety six, not counting the last one
it’s been a while since that clip was shown
ok, i’m going to try and complete the car wash level for the full cake thing
just like me
pistol. don’t try the others with short range
error, no end of statement or something
and don't throw me out of any windows
slap them
would you be willing to sell it to me
why cannot you can not?
majestic spaghetti is overthrowing the bourgeois
night
it’s like rosalina in super mario galaxy 2
youre asking why i cant go slap the person playing music
bop it, twist it, revolt it
its my extended family's annual summer meetup. which means i die tonight.
i can give it for like five minutes
i'll arrange for that
flubs bad news
but yeah, after this i have no reason to ever see any of my family ever again and could not be happier
i have one cousin who plays pokémon
it's yelling
yeah and honestly shes the worst cousin but one of the best people. i have a pretty horrible extended family
why didn’t i crown myself king instead?
in game or irl?
besides last time flubs came in um
things blew up
no shit
no he called everyone bitches
out of context pin
requirements for a pin
ok, now i’m bored 😑
so is unity and unreal
no seriously reread what you said very slowly
wait might be calling it off
yeah i call bullshark on that
flub flub
oh you got it up?
it's cool eyan, no worries
that and if i were to join i would be maxed out already lol, max bard
i said me lol, i'm in pre supreme calamatis
~~don’t~~ blow it up <:kappa:374346980136058893>
also are you cleansing the world evil?
can i just interject to point how how nice it is when my code spits out error messages
hey, i was going to eat that chicken thigh
this has been a psa. back to your regularly scheduled madness. thank you.
a really cool mount too :d
it’s poisoned with something
a new royal anthem
eh, just leave him against the wall, he'll be fine
i'll probably never touch an mmo
im bored
no you cant
holy shit had a dream about eyan uploading again
there was no overlay just the top screen and bottom screen and a black background
never before in my adult life have i looked so forward to the holidays lol
i want the most bullshit environment ones like pokefloats, the spinning metroid one, and big blue
the menus in smash 4 were a mess imo
smash 4 menus weren't the best.
i hate clg and tsm so much, i have no clue who i want to win this game
i doubt it will
ghirahim
fun fact, i've never actually played skyward sword
oh i see.
im not dead
i bid thee farewell from the crime scene
*speeds out of control and runs over flubs and into a wall* i'm herreee and ready to parttyyyyy.... oh fudge i ran flubs over
how many curses are seven lettrs
oh my god flubs

f l u b s
c e a s e
i had to im sorry
oh hey it's rainy
what isn't happening?
real men do let's plays with their phones
oh, i just rarely ever see you say something stupid put of bordem so i assumed you were rather relaxed
and more often then that, i'm bored
pretending to not want to die is a full time job
i'm just a blue organ so you don't see me much obviously
and it pays very poorly
if anything i thought that because of the purple name
if acting like i was an idiot all the time was a job, i'd be rich and not be working at walmart right about now
you don’t have to
this is true lol
~~don't answer that~~
of course you sellouts would think the common folk are insane
tends to be how people eat yeah
so my teeth hurt today so i had to rely on swallowing most of my food
i'm just more active so i can attain red galoer and be haopy
hehe
and why not a goomba
no swallow without chewing much flubs
i wanna play the piano guitar thing
my only skills are day drinking and sleeping in

and, demon lord is like 23?
the roomba

yall remember so much
i remember flubs shoving his mic up his colon but im pretty sure that wasn't on purpose
majestic thats how memory works
i don't think that's how memory works flubs
natural selection has failed us
it's only in place for lesser evolved species
only up to i'd argue 2001-2
anything after that is when common sense died in it's entirety
btw told you camelot 2.0 will be successful master

also yes kugal
ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=┏(;ﾟдﾟ)┛

oxidation is balancing shit right
god how the fuck do i remember this
so apparently my power didnt go out, i kicked the surge protector power button that my computer is connected to
im the smartest person
and i felt like making fun of them
or the random access memory to remember what is going on
pokes will
its all backwards
make fun of my videos ida
playing 100% orange juice.
does any country not have an independence day nowadays?
but here’s what i sound like
well ida did say she didn’t know what i sound like and now she does
it's...the abc song...
i watched a dude rob a gun store on liveleak yesterday
but my finger slip so it was jk
it scares the everloving shit out of me
i have a song stuck in my head
which shows the peak of my power because i can always get my way now
so how is this peak power?
eat more
meat aisles
he didnt explode :(
this man is a genius
from what though?
i have embraced the magic
monday. busy. work. hatred. blugh
she does not approve of me hurting others 😑
idk who but i did it
it’s too quiet *blows something up*
<:rarityflirt:447907828187922452>
oh i did that with some doctor show a few years ago
what>
both are kinda bitchy at times and apparently i have that trait as well
like an actual doctor show
i would say try it...but it doesn’t seem to fit you unless you are willing to go through a whole season
at my place of work, you will see people spend so much money on those and usually not make that amount back
so thats cool
welp didn’t win anything from the scratch ome
it uses location so it would for you
don't be an undesirable person
hey gummy remember the time you found a way around the at-everyone ban?
that wasnt really him finding it as much as not following my directions, the much easier way to do it is through the other thing i showed you drago
am i undesirable?
yeah, but i was trying to avoid outright saying it in case anyone got any smart ideas
rounding is hard
putting on new pants and whatnot
detroit is an objectively better game but the ending is a little heavy handed
guess i better take benny out again
hello there
i think he was the head of admin of the forums actually
i had a good bday though besides not winning anything on my scratch ticket
just gotta figure out drago’s bday and troll him im twitter that day
i didn't do anything
twitter
since she hugs backs
its fine as long as you keep your socks on
im pretty sure there wasnt much sfw stuff in there
you could have done something like this
nope
i like the one where gummy goes outside and gets a life
but it’s good
i like grumpy bear
ah good luck bear
neither can i
or the sequel on the switch
i never took the ap exam in the one ap class i took; i just paid for the credits
mount and blade warband napoleonic wars
i sold my console for pc parts
very bad
who scared him this time?
i only  terrify my closest friends but they usually know how to piss me off
you terrify them
pokemon go is fun
hmmm
for once?
watch an episode or something
maybe that one
i'm a bunny rabbi
hey! i didn't get to that part yet!
ida i'm taking away your television privileges for that
idk master
you learn from your mistakes, master
what's television?
also cozy > compact
on the servers where people constantly change their colored roles and nicknames, i dont bother
or you can be like me and haven’t played anything on steam since i uninstalled it years ago <:kappa:374346980136058893>
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>

can’t believe you hate florida
oh she’s been hitting on me the day she ask me out in grade 10
practically canada
but that was her latest attempt
your state sucks drago
florida is good in the sense that "it's not new jersey"
you know im not going to let you compliment new jersey to that degree
why flubs?
or whatever the fuckin quote is
oh so you went to the not populated places
lets go to canada flubs
new jersey is great though
i post one gif like usually and new people decided to spam images in the general chat because of me
or rather your showing-id addiction
okay superheronerd
that's what they all say
free money
sleep now bye
haha master no. raw pasta is superior. raw, unshaped pasta
any cooked pasta is good
i just don’t like the large jump in levels
wait
i got gud
all i had to do was show up to school
i prefer hugh over cheren pretty much being “i have to get stronger” almost every time you meet
that’s how i feel
i have a showing id addiction
wrong channel but good job
because i never heard of that word before and i don’t know what it means
(－‸ლ)
i nommed a lot of things
you stalking all your friends with it?
i kind of want to try that but at the same time i don't because what if it doesn't work
games tab in friends thing
and procrastinating homework
lmao
*noms sock* tastes like chicken
random stuff
cant be bothered
i hate friendship
so if the sun were to explode that would be a literal disaster
like honestly there are better ones than ours
use wikipedia
the seasons are crazy there
its just math slang
rage face
i think im going to go back to my paper now
and thats on the complex plane?
why not just play the one thats on windows 7
then its not a virus now
so like does the letter matter
what would the baby look like though
i mean its detail enough
i have backup from the source
that doesnt make sense
well misty tells me i have a gambling problem
i knew flubs was addicted to cocaine
13 reasons is awful
and that still sounds better than my writing calia
i want dramatic music
maybe should have gotten yelled at but whatever
batman the animated series and superman the animated series
i had enough teenage drama irl, why do i need more of it on television
i just hate it, but listening in on other people's 'issues' and 'drama' can be really fun when you're not involved
shit
static shock
static shock and the zeta project
and batman beyond
no kappa. what does it stand for
what you mean wolverale?
and no teen titans is not in the dcau
dude he has such a punchable face
im watching it right now

my bsing is pretty good
its a collection of sabers from fallen jedi
you counter it with alcohol, the higher the proof the better
what class
yeah that can't be fixed
although im not sure how many of those fuckers managed to have purple or red sabers
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

‘tis treason?
oh you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead, now i think its high time that you lie down and bleed
and the braggart named ragnar was boastful no moreeeee, when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor
now where'd i put that rumstep
sometimes i think i need a third screen
welcome to playing a bard
coudl be worse, i could be writing this on my phone
(he's bronze)
but yeah my gpu is able to do higher quality on it and it looks just as good
i could keep it on a different desk but i’d want to keep a theme and i don’t think a desk from the 1800s would match anything else i made or bought
ouch
260 words and counting ;-;
no i saw one with things like witcher 3 and gta in it somewhere
>adc has top damage
you need to stop gambling *takes gummy’s money and runs*
flubs

my dog
the continents of my mom

what in the sweet name of flubs is elementary vector algebra
im done for today
but it uses matrices to find the cross product
yeah it's been a long time
you think thats weird
thanks
eyan streamed yesterday and probably will next week on friday
right now he's pretty busy with his current job and doesn't have too much time for gaming, but we're doing a terraria playthrough on fridays
hello there
i was barely able to pay attention to yesterdays stream my schedule has been not so flexible
going for high end right away or just straight for something cheap that can play a decent bunch?
i play the spreadsheets
its ok, you still have time to ascend to pcmr
hey, i love the current meta
i will also never be a pc gamer
hehehe
fuck yeah
never use it
relatively lower on fun scale
stop
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
booleanreduction counterargument: no
streams are not fun
why am i the only one who gets hurt?
i wasted about an hour of my life on league and gave up on it
dont worry, the client doesnt work either
it has crashed my rune pages at least 5 times now

damn now that reminds me of scatman
nice level up message
yeah
e!kill master
we have one slot
hey master remember an age long ago where we wanted to _discourage_ violent roleplay? :')

again
freeze voice?
who the fuck knows
more or less
rip?
not 3
i didnt do beans to the user join event, that's all on you
i think it needs a few more role playing games on it before i actually spend the money on one but that doesn't mean it's a bad console
great
except i made the wrong event the first time
right now all the (exclusive) rpgs on the switch i can think of are xeno 2 and octopath though
drago get a job
dont you know anything else that could be useful?
just look at his code
you did your first one for free
otherwise you would hate me
no youre not
because she was cute in your eyes maybe
no she knows
it was a joke. i’m sure we all know that 😑
maybe a week
im going to take my leave from this conversation now
i said harder, not less hard
double anyone else's damage
good point
hes a juggernaut
i thought he was a bunny

titenic.
<:lul:305559915714576385>

welcome to rito patching

drago stop. burning garbage isnt good for the environment
thats the spirit
wahluigi
the mets are in free fall, i think they need a parachute more than anything else
nope
how much food can a food hold doesnt make sense
thank
eat...liter...what
so, like ice cream, it makes plenty sense to measure by volume
you arent making sense
hi, i'm your mom, i'm everyone on here's mom
and for gummy just go off of his picture. his name changes on the pretty much daily because...reasons
that one was dragonite
i just disappear sometimes to make it look like i have a life
also ice cream brb
good job
a liter of ice cream?
mostly
i've been enjoying xenoblade 1 but i don't plan on playing any of the later games
im assuming this is all weeb shit
if you want your name fixed i'll do it
i will cut you
niall? i agree, best emperor
yeah well for a physical copy that's cheap lol

flubs whats are you rambling about
shouldnt you have a few med bags for each of the major staypoints?
no i hate it
wait whats happening now?
also i only live like 45 minutes away from the us
this ones ok
it's not like it's cold all year long xd
why doesnt it give a preview
i'm inside flubs' head
i was surprisingly popular in high school
gummy will give you the tour
which is funny because i hated people then also
no wolve
my district doesnt have a middle school
there was one memorable teacher in middle school
high school was much better
also imma focus on getting up so no talk for flubs
also fun fact, my mom just started supply teaching high school this year
we have a ™ button
want me to re-route it to algetty?
here in general we just talk about depression
or me
makin' me feel old
it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
also wait if rainy is the mom then wouldnt there be two moms
zeus got it on with a lot of women didnt he?
there can be two moms, jesus christ it's 2018
the newest few at least
i think dieno estimated either 150 or 300 women
classic barry
get bionic legs
dude that sounds sick
can i have his ashes too?
i can ignore the sounds and listen to the words
well yeah
music is stupid thats why
it's like the whole zeus, eyan gave birth to all of you through his brain hole
wolve luigi isnt a millennial
it wasnt at work it was on my bed
nah i dont care about that
why are there builds?

i type in supergummying and it goes to you
hmmm
draco perfect screenshot

i need a hobby
no 5 was cadance
msgs here
sorry deci
but yeah i can afford one i should get back into gun care

thats why my picture is luigi dabbing
its not ambient horror but it doesnt try to be
last time i used a credit card on steam and other places
thanks
i bought it to give the creator money
he deserved it
the old man from pawn stars has died
if i do i'm gonna pre-record all my lines on tts
why are we attacking drago gummy
signed in on a school computer now, let's see how long i can do this before the teacher notices
10 mi ute presentation on why schools should teach computer science more
this is why chuggaaconroy is one of the few youtube gamers i can watch nowadays : (
is there a final exam for speech?
rollercoaster tycoon 2
idk but ive had interesting luck with that so far in this school
well you know why he said it?
rude
yeah he was like one of the only authors i read wililngly since harry potter ended
silly rc
my mind just cant understand doing two things at once
ahem
legs are good for things even if you cant use them
it's about as complicated of a definition as the average program that dragonite writes
does it take effort to read this
sorry gummy is just rubbing off on me
excel is just google sheet's creepy anti-internet cousin
you are supposed to wear heels flubs
everything
hai majestic
guya im gonna be covering all of this tonight
why must it be really active when i’m busy?
flubs is your dog superman
*throws math out the window* i don’t need this right now
watchmojo
man there was nothing like wii baseball
nicholas the second was a dumb ass
thats where youre wrong
well yeah
twister
know what game would have made wii sports infinitely better?
my scripting language is hereby known as "orange"
i was starting to think you hadn't received my message
we want mario 64
powdered mini donuts are so good, let me tell you
they're good
he could save others from cheap food, but not himself
oh boi, sneaky back at it again with another cosplay
oh ahit
where do i put down my resume?
now i can have time to watch batman with the asshat
oh, and stephen is going to meet mal in canada for something
she is awesome
oh boy
well i've got some years to go
congrats!
yet you do it and make it look easy
much curlier, and benny has brown on his ears
assassins are a dime a dozen, i'd just do it myself
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
nice
i would hire an assassin
i just found out we’re on the 15th anniversary of the room coming out
cant record replays tho
had it happen to me once
i remember that one quarter i got a 100+ in a class only to discover that the report card generator took the min of the actual grade and 100
my report cards don't do that i think, mine would register as a 101 or whatever
im the dumbest person i know flubs
that show turned to shit, i stopped watching
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
solving in general is my cup of tea
same
because time paradox
oh, never heard of it, lol
and future
but only because
it doesnt make the show better, it just makes it confusing
he was
oh yeah
who were the contenders
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
who’s sara?
thea is #1 i'll stand by it
nah, kara and sara are both my two least favorites
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
legends never had a truly bad season
and guns
except og dr wells
never even watched supergirl
im like halfway thru s1
and nothing but
couldn't get into it, don't know why
i'm not getting ice cream but just let me say that i usually just get vanilla
super common near me
wait flubs did you say ben and jerry's in town?
have yet to go to the ben and jerrys place near me in a while tho
its abysmal
i figured out why she didnt eat this one
i said pasta
flubs was talking about a show
（。_°☆＼(- – )
anything is better
yeah because they suck
almost one year anniversary of something every big
the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
id say your death would be quick and painless, but id be lying
one more day of class and then im _actually_ done for the summer
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
i dont have a source on that though
plus if you scroll up they replied to someone who had pics
i will need to recheck but i never had a reunion planned
indeed.
you join the skype chat around july 18-19 of 2016
but like why do they need to do it that way
oh, i don’t see jello that often
hiya
awesome
and those sandtraps always get in my way
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
just finished high school
actually my road trip might not be that bad because i get to see my pokémon-playing cousin . . .
fool.
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
pokes with stick
foooooooooooooood
i'm magus, it's ok
i resent that statement
i do need someone to fight him lol

july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
it’s rotten because of stupid events that happened
i miss your dank memes
zeal is supposed to be the apex of the world or something
i'll give you 10% of my check
so darkness is limited to magic or something
you already have all you want from previous events as well
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
do we though?
but that's just a part of life
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
brb starting a pyramid scheme
he’s 8 pounds
the exam looks like fun
how much time left on aws?
can't be bothered to switch to d.js?
i lose and lose
correct
i just know the dates
so it's badluck day number 4
actually it's personal so i can't talk about it
i insulted drago!!!
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
divert 1% of bird game to d.js
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
that butter replacement is better squid
if you can't run a 1996 video game you have some issues—oh you mean the new one
i wonder how many of those are in there
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
i have quantum distortion cat blobs
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
_looks at bella_
when your the ruler of baconatorland
only because i play so much mario kart on switch i wanna see how good this guy is
how many people care?
i have a bunch of shit connected and im on like 40 servers and nobody has ever bothered me about any of it
did i miss it
more of a '100% all items / achievements' kind of guy
it just amazes me what people come up with
vista
speedruns especially interest me
whoops
fire is ida’s thing
and montauk is the fucking worst
the french wanted the brits to shoot first
they wanted france to shoot first
that seems more like letting your rival pick a pokemon first
the french were cowards after napoleon’s empire collapsed
you mean
yes he missed
napoleon is why all the european flags look the save
so we are basically brits
it's not as complex as people make it out to be, it's just who do you want to date, and who do you want to fuck
nah spain was what was the early reason
then the english did
either way napoleon would have had a little but of a laugh if the u.s. took canada
it is, and i'm winning
i touched a piece of the wall that was in berlin once
of course
and hope it catches on
which would've been so much cooler
i am the senate
my family is from france
im sharing memes with friends
oh i see
now it's a civil war
idk what i'm talking about
sooo yeah
im freee im flubs
good
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
i know that wasn't the point of this, but i think it's fair to point that out
foooooooooooooooood
give me a sample one
i realize all of that, i'm not gonna get into every little detail there
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
such is the way of htings
manman sounds like a good superhero
drago you are in charge of it now
idk, try poking him or something
im not human
shut up i like my version more
and yes
but you cant be animal and man
hes drago's evil twin that doesnt make puns so thats actually the good one
no worse
who said i was making steaks?
also youre not cooking youll make the steaks horribly
im not eating that
i eat like a soldier
yeah *replaces airbag with potato bomb*
shush
also i keep reading beef taillow
i just bought 4000 pieces of puzzle so cats aren't allowed in my room till that's all solved
also my video editing job got delay
good job
thought you had it on the floor
flubs
wanna hang tonight?
no stream or server today, small chance for monday
and squid sounds like a stoner
which is kinda similar to stoner voice
4000 pieces just means it'll last longer
....
fair enough
do you not know what a stoner means?
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
my bacon for baconators...
well i guess you wouldn't go vegan if you were in it for the taste
they might've changed a few things since than.
painfully so
i remember something else i used to eat was a vegan product, but they changed some ingredients and well it ain't anymore
nyet
do not sleep at me
as with many products
mhmm
whats the old folks home
mhmm
drago gummy called you crazy
you arent gummy
half of conversations are fun
i like music
hide the pain harold
and its almost been a year since the best day of your life
3+ hours in now
which isnt equal
well camelot 2,0
horrible server name
people have a reputation of getting murdered here
well damn
the fuck would i need moderators for
if i make myself to apparent i will get mugged
or a glock
but it really isnt that bad
i know but i can minimize my chances
i got one honor for this
traditional news outlets think anything that’s animated is for children 😒
so what your saying is we need to seize the means of news production
no no kill the old people. old people hold jobs and say mean things so just remove them from the equation
and blamed it for making a kid commit suicide
now i’m just waiting for the bbc/ddlc memes.
about halfway through last year
thats 6 million exp for that level
dear god
chautauqua
a gummy's afternoon
why did the game grumps recreate a meme format
i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
is fortnite turning our children into satan loving cannibals? more at eight
i had just a minor defensive reaction to it
but he hugged me
okay
the 12
you know what
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
we know
but i needed to teach a friendship lesson today
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
why are some of the sabers different
i just like leaving though
interesting
do as i say not as i do
but you wouldn't last
welp
publicly existed? i was there
before the server existed, camelot
of course
it's bigger and better
something something wookies
we are talking about a server
send me in
boom
well i assume some of the ones i talked to are there
hence the bitches
still didnt answer my question
flutterbot
wait
if it has better cooling, go for it
nice
did alienware glue those in or some shit?
master
you will
the case i have rn i got for free from brad
upgrade
ram is good for me as well
fair enough
there is still a new motherboard and power supply
what’s a good mid tower that isn’t that expensive?
mid i would say
just go on newegg and look at cheap ones
it sucks
that wont cost you more than a mortgage
unless master wants them here
ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)
intel® core™ i7-4790, intel® h87 chipset, 8gb ram, 120 gb ssd and 2 tb hdd, 8x dvd+/-rw drive, dw 1550 802.11 b/g/n/ac wi-fi + bluetooth wireless combo, integrated realtek alc892 codec, and a gtx 1050,
im going to end up blowing something up
for this league game to end first
oh wait
not really
thats 3 not 2
how much video ram on the 1050?
notice the giant 2 gb in the top left corner of the box
i just saw that
im looking at motherboards
yeah
power?
instead of atx
currently some msi ones
did something go?
nah case upgrade
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
shots fired
*throws one piece out the window* too many episodes
i cant remember the rest of the one piece beer song though
i'll make a partitioned by --- version of the doc
the thing with e!commands is that nobody uses them after the first few.days
hey master
should keep me entertained for fifteen minutes
so other than that, how's everyone doingm
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
except for like the crash one (me)
cpu model?
im not changing anything else
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
what's this? i won't be getting it back either way
gum gum the dum dum for psu get the cx 550w
my sanity
oh i know what happened
why do you guys carry laptops with you for class?
except for the time i recorded b roll for something while waiting for the professor
you want side window?
for when the time comes
my major is video production
dont burn the server down while im gone
yeah i need to know this too
good to know
and what i got seemed like a devil spawn
i even check to make sure the rectangular coordinates would graph fine and in rectangular coordinates it works just fine
what formular?
now, back to fallout
i check the angle measure is in radians so thats weird
what the fuck
i think i have an idea
i think you have it go multiple rotations and only pick points to connect every so often
mmkay
mmkay
i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
youre in degrees or rads?
from its bad coding
winter is that but with more white
so i erased it and graphed the polar equation r = 9 and this is what i got
winter is that but with more white
spring and fall have allergies though
mom wasn’t supposed to go with dad and sister to the city but i guess they did
is it valuable stuff?
sister did something even more stupid
shaun who?
zoom 6?
i wonder if they actually expect anyone to watch it
probably doing better than you drago lol
spring and fall have allergies though
i have eaten nothing but poptarts today
then eat
dip in milk
he’s your son in fallout 4
kyogre normally learns ice beam, yes
but i had no clue it was called super tower
can kyogre learn splash
what if they're double stuff already, is he making quadruple stuff oreos
there you have it folks
you wouldn't believe me
well this is the other super tower on this site
and you were right
youre good!
sorry to hear that
no just 55 million and what i would buy
wait, what?
and gonna buy a brick...
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
thanks, i mean i think i can reach it since video premieres count as streaming
theyre course rough irritating and they scratch cars
ok, time for sleep
now you’re in the dirt
good job
was telling the pony server yesterday about me getting ban on youtube
what wat
they believe it was nintendo
well i know how to do videos right
it was funny
apparently some famous guy took offense at corphish and handed his ass to him
holy fuck
do you plug a monitor in a graphics card or motherboard?
now gummy
you plug it into the headphone jac
hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
seriously
they're trying to break the record for most upvote post, <:senate:395030198636249089>
la familia went to italy a few years ago
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
of course you have to be sarcastic...
are you proud of me if i slav squatted in front of the vatican
this is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
it's a book
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
fireworks are ez even though i've never tried them
. . . there is no possible interpretation of this where it doesn't sound awful
didn’t see that much yesterday
i meant the former best friends list
though my brony friends still haven’t left even though i have anger problems
that gummy is crazy?
not through blood though
that or you become unofficial blood siblings
as opposed to the usual 99%?
i guess at this point im immortal
so what have we learned today here class?
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
drago sounds like a robot
fuck you
really?
no gummy
blitz as on of those amazing deep voices
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
it was enterntaining
yall should have met teenager dragonite
i love how drago was like
am i the only one who likes past me on this server?
why would i switch spots with you? and what are we switching spots with?
you won’t like your past self one day
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
trust me on this one
fuck
how come i still do?
what is life's greatest illusion
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
silence, brother
this guy gets it
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
it'd be pretty highon their list if i had a girlfriend and brought her with.
im single as well
unfortunately i'm a single loser
yes i'm also wearing the beetle
or how long was the day before god made the sun
oh jesus christ gummy
yay single buddies
i’m quadruple
all this talk about strangling and pain makes me extra sad i have no gf, rip
wrong person
of teeny tiny pizza
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
yeah shed kill you
she wouldn’t hurt me
it was in the 80s both days
oh please i've done and said worse, now i wanna hear it
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
that is until they probably get my wedding invites alongside a big fuck you
i got distracted and yeah
oh i called one of the mods in a server "favourite little mod"
<:failfish:372152438355918848> oh skarm...
you aren't even on the list
gummy are you calling me short
(◡‿◡✿)
got th modding yet?
god shit on the kaiser!
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore
there's no max level anymore
can't believe wob found a loop hole through rule 8
skyrim 620+
i am the most crazy
lmfao when lee sin doesn't get a single kill or assist until 20 minutes into the game
did the presentation
but yes kingofzeal is eyan.
im actually psychopath level according to both online and irl people who know me well
eyan found it on reddit
<:treason:396483914803445761>
basically people getting caught stealing at a gas station
gummy cant you watch a normal youtube channel ever
very fun so far
kept the 5 ties and bow tie on
so is there gonna be a stream tonight?
that's actually the name of a youtube channel.
it’s friday right?
ooo i like rivers
so the duck will have to be the replacement
no chicken
err no thanks
im going to learn how to fly
sir you insulted my honour i challenged you to a duel
cool
i wanna get the duck blown up by the ship
luckyskarm
ooo another pokemon argument
“some people live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world”
*throws the sentence out the window* i suggest you start over
i want the roleplay
“i do not know when the fire in gummy first burn, perhaps he always had a destiny...”
there thats what i have so far
i mean im doing it im third person
so technically it would be an biography
enemies (drago) and peoplei despised (drago)
i guess i really hate you
im writing a biography on myself
teaching the bot to sing is the best thing i ever did
how about that?
and guess what you aren’t in it!
the pokemon tournament
i meant acorn gun
even though they weren't even in that server to begin with
i got a sword
does coffee have a coffee version?
imma break something
i want rum right now as well
why is the rum always gone
xenobald
whatever you say fantom
right gummy
drago and majectic sound the same
now if bella ended with a "o" i'd say it sounds pretty similar to "jello" but that's all ive got
gummy can i write your biography
i got an eye catching topic sentence
perhaps he always had a destiny, but sometimes destiny can use a little help..or even an argument"
panda and squid sound similar...
but i need something more powerful
oh i got it
time seem to stop
thats what i have so fay
what i should be doing: taking the dog for a walk
reset your history and binge saxophone music
what i want to be doing: fallout
*takes the mace* i could use this
i am angry
the irony of that.
how have you not gone insane yet?
hawt
gummy the south pole is not the equator
penguins
animation when
｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
ah fuck i put explosives in there too get down
:ya da:
goddamn emote isn’t working
there
for some reason, “ta” kept getting autocorrected to “ya”
why?
would have taken me days at home
you rang
im supposed to be a wailord master
reroll that dream
i dreamt i got promoted to mod on pony server for one week but i had to change my name from supergummying, rarity gif expert to supergummying, wailord master
i hate skitty
im going to get a sylveon gif maybe
wait
he promise to be home like thursday
is that <:treason:396483914803445761> i see
im not sure if that's how it works
time for some relaxing mount and blade
im refering to the server theme nto the usual topic
subway
i was sleeping
and looking at the randomness of your nickname history
pluperfect it is, carry on
did he just hug me?
anyways what is your weapon for this duel?
dndgreentext
six perfect for tampa bay
there goes the perfect game
after burning through about 15 of them
silence you
because i dont already have enough of those
you need more
he’s my new best friend
fineee i;ll ask ida
who else do i fight?
....
no that special tried taking my waifu away
she’s my sibling now
bunny would probably just chew on the cards
thats why i asked you about the writing to a file in java
okay rainy
big brother feature
whee
use id ninny
that might require nuking the user stats and starting over
just copy everyone's stats to a spreadsheet then replace them back into the id form
64 is overkill though right?
i doubt that unless you fixed your sue of a character.
plus i do a great rarity
what smirk?
no role play
yea wolverale
my face is this 😐
where is luckyskarm?
well i could always drag ida in the roleplay
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
it’s usually ida that drags me around
e!crash
you always agree with me
how are we boring?
its basically everywhere
why cant i have my code just work
it’s fun <:keepo:327304799919800321>
you gotta say ridiculous things everyday to catch people’s attention
and go on from there
you dont call it defenestration
probably
hmm i guess i could take master's approach to the big brother bot and have a timer counting down rather than a timer counting up
wait what
you guys are on your own for vc though
why do you think i leave this place all the time?
helps a lot rainy
it's not a timer counting up
boy do i love it when my code doesn't work!
all lemonade is created equal. some are more equal than others.
i’m one for regular lemonade
big brother was 1984—oh that
i saw the play when i was in like sixth grade though.
fucking autocorrect
but i want to know how fallout ends
traps are so so gay
if you say that traps arent gay, its because you are gay and are just denying it
intel® core™ i9 7980xe (18-core, 24.75mb cache, up to 4.4ghz with intel® turbo boost max 3.0)
well
let's not descend into that argument
dual nvidia® geforce® gtx 1080 ti graphics with 11gb gddr5x each (nvidia sli® enabled)
like my new wailord pfp?
you never really lose it
yeah
case should come tomorrow or wednesday
so looks good right?
the power supply was heavy
i don’t wanna video edit
editing an advertising video for him
my stuff came
editing is not hard
thats a horrible idea
invite her to this server
all she does is spam cancer balls and play with stuff that was relevant on instagram last year
he is using fimora
actually now that i look closer at it
clearly not by much
it looks an awful lot like movie maker
hush you
while i'm thinking about it
cause its unrealistic for some like dragonite or animal man where those might be used in a different context
sure
im not complaining
okay the bot can mention people but i've trained it to not in most circumstances
haven't had that for a while.
i have it bookmarked
i was voting for him you know
but um
don't look at me it's not my fault we're out of phoenix down
dead yes
nowadays, it does feel a little slower in this server than usual
and more repetitive
it's slow because drago was suppose to entertain here now
i'd say it's a tcp/ip connection between our computers and discord's server location
i knew it
<:treason:396483914803445761>
speaking of dead where is flubsypoo?
yeah
drago's forum friends got the boot
shaymin still shows up on the online list but doesnt talk, superpikachu talked like once, breezaps used to be active but is too busy for normal things nowadays
and there was one more?
ever since he collab and made friends with people
has he grown up at all?
i told you, he's the mother of all mary sues
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
i let the mods do everything because im lazy
i imagine that went well
i think i know a place
i keep to myself a lot so that explains it
that’s pretty much it
1327 for me
he better not be greek
dude rome stole like 90% of its shit from greece
well greece deserves it
do we call him dragobro?
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
i do enjoy being outside in the summer lol
strangely there are four results in the search bar for "disowns gummy" and none of them are me
that discord filters messages that are too old?
thats not the proper way to search
gomme?
i tried that too
the serailzable shit?
so it is
oh hes offline
thats not full ap thats kayle
which items
nice
i just got baned
so basically everyone who wanted to be banned wasnt and everyone who didnt want to be banned was

burn your phone
whats up pals, whats goin on
so is renpy
big brother thing
good job
oh dear
i have stuff to repair it bit the tools are ancient so idk how well theyll work
2.5 mi
30 mins later
it's okay, life's a joke
i embrace the magic
i have magic
and gummy, have you considered gitting good?
and gummy, have you considered gitting good?
hmmm
nobody does
he’s a great guy
you are no fun
never heard of him
sounds like a weird guy
does this look like a healthy sleep schedule?
so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
someone explain to my sister what a raspberry pi is
hallo der österreich
i'll fix it some other day. for now, code.
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
why's that?
life is dumb
/r/history
same
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
what server?
complicated bullshit
i know the rule channel are very nsfw
is it my server demon lord?
that’s not a rule in camelot 2.0
oh the rules say nothing about people spying on my server sooo i can’t do anything about it unless he breaks rule 8
where was i again?
good job rc
god damn it that’s another one that bypassed my rules
well some servers allow both
i never talk there tho
idk it’s a reddit discord, reddit is weird
including this one, i'm only in 4
i have no friends
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
you can guess which one this is
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
ask master
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
a lot
i have my own bad counter this time around
if i just plug in the hard drive and cpu without closing the case, will it boot?
you should get some fresh thermal paste before attaching the heat sync.
have you injested enough of your namesake
k thanks
i need to get in my pc again
that’s what i am gonna do today
not having proper cooling for your cpu is *not* something i would risk.
i might give you a hard time on other things, but if you need computer help, i'll do what i can to assit.
is that true?
i’ll take the motherboard risk
k both hard drives are good
perfectly balanced
while others say i don’t
update: spare inner tube has a hole in it, too. time to see if i can remember hownto patch them.
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
brb fixing my tire and going on another bike ride
a guy posted his setup in a server and i saw for the first time an extended super tower
reading patch notes is for losers
that’s just a toaster
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
theres a lot of anime that i need to watch
current process
e!google server tower
i never read the rules
now to move the processor over
pretty
like this
well maybe you should have considered that before doing something that you knew was going to result in me seeing them on fire
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
they're good for your health
i have a response to that but i have to find the timestamp
like i'm thrilled when people want to talk in here but he was making people uncomfortable
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
youtube recommends dogs getting tased videos
yay for typing 3d modeling shortcuts into the discord chat window again
cmcmcmcmcmfzzfet
i’m back from work ya ninnies
that's actually a really funny idea
oh finnaly
i lost all my servers for a good three minutes
with dynamite in it
wait what
what about those bean boozled ones?
the grape one
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
~~i just don’t like reading so i only watch anime~~
<:gwnanamihanekawhat:399930848914440192>
ok, i feel tired. but if i try to go to sleep now, i’ll just toss and turn for over an hour. but, i don’t have anything else to do 😑
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
the only thing that pops into my head is why
fix harder
be grateful.
however rated you think you are
had a headache earlier this morning while i was out being socially productive
gummy you _are_ a robot
how are you this night
well that didnt happen
i sure do
but all good now
flubs is like dead
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school
i said i thought it was wednesday in another server
so thats today's til
because why not
gummy your face is yesterday
dont nom
glad to hear it
melt it down and sell it as a doggy chew toy
i’m back from work ya ninnies
im fine with not evolving pikachu but i would like to evolve eevee
maybe some cables
guys let's just face it, eyan streams when he has time
thats not your pc
i mean technically you said it last tuesday, so....
its a vitamin
greetings, squid.
master you are smart with online shopping
welcome to windows
windows products
horrible
and it was still good when i reinstalled windows after some fuckups
the royal navy is better than winter
other than that summer is brilliant
its really all in the mosquitos
hmmm
isn't gimp available on linux
that's something i never though i'd say until last year
im testing things
someone gifted me ac4 a while ago
i played a little bit of it and really need to get back to it now that i have a computer that can run it
hes the best league player ive ever seen
gummy did you say "a terabyte" or "eight terabyte"
what am i going off on
gummy im going to strangle you
i have not done anything since i sent it to you to look at
good times
because javascript
and push it to github like a normal person this time :<
hang on
it's just terrible
for the record i don't know what half of these do
lightweight
pc from the three days made me tired
so i was going to remark on how i've never had any problems with sony vegas crashing but then it decided to freeze on me for no reason
you know what? that's like the third time in as many days that i've posted osmething to the wrong server
good job
4.2 maybe
whats your point?
what is the music of life?
what is the gift of death?
im an expert
i fell off the ether mine a good four or five times
this is fun
i feel like going outside
third time being banished
the moon is where they banish people to over there
that’s embarrassing drago and you should feel bad
and now i visited the moon
in this windy old weather
adulting is overrated
stormy old weather
rainy here
well
again
thats why i am saying it out loud here
well if he doesn't have a source that means he isn't stealing them from me good
pretty sure skarm has to be lower case
i'm pretty sure that's the default
he started one, but never finished.
it grows exponentialy
and i forgot how to check
see thing
pretty much.
bonus points if you never had one in the first place
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
wow apparently the league community turned into a bunch of damn snowflakes, i can't say anything in chat anymore without getting banned
every ten levels
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
it kinda snuck up on me
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
i am more insane than everyone here
same
i guess dragonite
satan
well except skarm
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
well rainbow colour
well i think it's okay to send here since the guy sent it in a server that has over 3000 people
plus the other stuff soooo $700?
nice rgb indeedalso gummy rainbow isnt a color
well you better send pics
logitech gaming owns astro now?
i have the non rgb version of this mouse
scrub
but made with science
wow never saw a pre built one before
i had no clue what i was doing
and they did great though was hard through discord
sponsor by logitech g
thats how everything breaks
but 5 days
im singing right now master
get rainy to talk to you
sadly
and why am i in charge of the vc? thats drago's job
though i notice besides eyan, when i join many people join vc as well
except when eyan streams
well you guys suck one day i won't be around
i was thinking closer to 2%
you just have something to always talk about
i am retiring
what's going on?
i'm not sure why i was pinged
also is this true demon lord
does gummy carry a majority of voice calls here?
well get ida
magus9000 - today at 11:49 pm
no one likes staring at the sun and yet here we are all orbiting around it
hmmm
yeah
speak for yourself
no seriously i really wanna retire from shitposter who wants the job?
and i'm considering the same for you, just need your legal guardians to sign off on it
and they turn out like you
flubs is flubs but he can do my shit posting job
its easy
though i don’t say much anymore
it was just interesting to look back
that should speak for itself
you said yourself, drago, and ida
that isn’t pony base
all of you have access there
i got attacked by a rabbit
and?
lucky you
*breaks gummy’s 10 cents*
give me a dollar
more power to him, i say.
im actually really surprised
break time
dardoch is a bish
as "let us play [together]" or something like that.
i always heard the term “walkthrough” instead of “let’s play”
like 1% of my deaths were caused by falling off the world though
but without working arms
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team
i just pm him 3 hours ago asking if he was dead or in jail
reboot first
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
gandi will fuck you up
thinkingface
then a bunch of them appeared
and um a fried chicken steak would be nice as well
i mean uh
also i thought your town was literally all farm
many things and i hate typing on my phone so ill explain whenever im not on my phone
i assume you were in jail
omg you went to the uk didn’t you?
yeah
not that short
so im kinda like you now
really?
close actually
you are in france
dragonite
don’t go to venice though
verona?
bari
im very roman
its not happening. im here for a reason, and its not to enjoy myself
there are still living flubioids?
theres no way i havent mentioned that
so not dying is a skill by that logic
well tbh it explains why benny comes to my house everyday
til rome.equals(china)
protection of the kneecaps money
theres this one town that i visited with my dad a few years back that is literally owned by the mafia
i met this wonderful little man last week. he sold me things at prices that made me think he stole them. but they were quite nice so i didnt mind
417 days or 14 months or 1.14 years or about the average time it takes for someone to climb out of bronze
flubs make me pizza
and i see flubs is not dead yet
not anymore
and needs you to be my wingman
because they're fun
ok im gonna go eat and then not be here for a while. do stuff while im gone so i can not know about it.
good?
no she didnt
i’m back from work ya ninnies
shouldn't it be gummy?
we figured it out
var spl=message.split(" ");
                var user=usertable[authorstring(e.message.author)];
                if (spl.length>=2)
                    user.refstring=spl[1];```
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
hai friends ^w^
```js
well that's unusual, for my code
....wow
you are good
hey i can do better
we don't talk about that
hello there
i feel like this is the 5th time the fishing pole story has come up now
we'll call it the fishing pole incident
no bad
i tried to but i can't get any msgs off my skype
good job riot
so you would have to import them on your end
lol xd
fuck yeah
don't listen to him
~~we’re all just crazy~~
stacks?
yeah thatll do it
hey master i'm bored and it's too early to make food, tell me something to do with the bot
(◕ ε ◕)
i vote option a.
and even though you sniped me in saying that i'm gonna type it anyway
i only cook bad food
good job benny (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
void fissue in the void
you went from rarity to coco
update: my cooking at least smells remotely like food. that's usually a good sign right?
i was trixie last week
it was the potatoes' fault honestly
same buddy
i hate mobile keyboards
never insult my waifu
i said often you troll
you also like rarity <:kappa:374346980136058893>
gummy, you really need to read a book on how to make good insults
i tell her that on a daily basis
no you fools thats this place in 14000 years
it hasn't kernel panicked yet anyway
i am
who needs the ground really
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
you expected otherwise?
well, you’re no help
/rage
not too much longer
i could probably tie that into the ref string thing once that's complete
bunny
drago be a sheep next
do `e!setref demon` or whatever you pref
noooo i just lost two pokémon in a nuzlocke
r.i.p. grozard “swormswood” and eletux “elle-ectro”
i remember the day when i knew who every single one of those shits was
wiz khalifa's "see you again" passed it by about 7.5 million views
im having heat stroke again
brb bringing back the champ
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
this is so sad alexa play wonderwall
dumb and dumber 2
guys
treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee
treguna mekoides treces enough dee
imma learn latin
that translate to 
then they travel around looking for that spell she needs
it's great
whats up squid hows life
alright, same
the one you gotta watch out for is gummy, aka rarity, or whatever he's calling himself right now
for example
howdy fellow frands
hilarious
i'm pretty sure i was last.
when was this?
nope i was gone
all set
you're welcome.
i entered a civ tournament
apprantly so.
but tbh it kinda makes sense
yeah i thought civ was like total war...
really?
turns out no....
greetings, majestic.
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
hello, hoe are you today?
that sounds amazing, bella.
~~git gud~~
rainy please
my family skipped the snes <:residentsleeper:338733575388135424>
i was pretty young
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
i come back for one moment and i'm greeted like this? shame on you.
it usually ends in a surrender or a treaty i think
i wake up to the ex apologizing to me
i’ll take his apology as a surrender
that's not how it works
classic front-loader.
they are out of ideas and stuff
that obviously hasnt stopped spongebob
well drago the people in mlp are smart and know how to end something
gummy just go to magfest so i can annoy you about losing a war to a mouse
9000 was the peak
galacon will still be running though
i've never seen a single episode and even  i know who rainbow dash is.
that's where the toilet plungers are
im the dovahclean
welcome to the world of airplanes
youre cereal
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
not misty from pokemon
how much do hotels cost
gonna punch drago at magfest
you can ask for a boo emote on your lvl 50
gonna get led out by security at magfest
she is nice
kappa
i thought it was a rabbit
no we just ignored it for the longest time
or lewdness
oh good, the food there is expensive
but i hate anime
video games
in some places
have fun with that
because it will cost $2000
brb getting food or something
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.
never book a flight for next day
now to beat the mouse
over your dead body
i figured something out
yeah
sounds like force
oh that reminds me
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
im with c9 even though they did stupid things at the start of the spilt
maaaaaaaaaaaaaake gaaaaaaaaaaaaames
this time i will win
if so try warframe next
you make it sound like skyrim
yes, like the thing you're losing to a two-inch rodent
its an mmorpg where you they give you just about every weapon you can think of to hack and slash your way through an army of massively cloned soldiers, money-centered tinheads, a hive minded virus, and some other shit
well shit
its free so id say go for it
hell muskets dont even have a point
howdy do friends
nice nice
you should take break on math
and my ocd just tells me "hey thats not right"
drago changed it to the numbers
oh yeah blitzypoo
i won the wat
the whole relationship issue is saved
i know
break time
play total war
im still single, and this is the first time in my life where i'm legit kinda sad about it so there's that
so i say war
i could make a fabulous girl
but i found someone even though she is the same one that tried to force me to be trans
i can help you
does it mean i want to?
so the chances of me screwing this up is high
i proposed to her yesterday but realize you were suppose to do that way later
i proposed to her yesterday
idk, believe in yourself
i've never traveled by plane and i hope to never really need to, or travel in general
wanna trade?
well shit i did the opposite
but theyre for flights to vegas and back
have fun
it is real
im betraying my own book
do i seriously need to translate what i mean
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
it's not hard
then i am pretty sure you can do the same
also star wars is ending in 2019
it says the last movie will be 2019
the last movie got cancelled
wanna see what will happen to the darth vader mini dude
yeah
his crybaby grandson
he was a whiny little emo punk
that is awesome
and took power for himself
she just said the office
well can i hate your cat then?
he betrayed the ugly dude
i need to get back on a normal person sleep schedule for when school restarts, anyway
because it sucks
i was inform by my mom
nvm then
i dont read mystery dungeon fanfiction
he better show up
i think you’ll need more
@ rainy
fuck
i almost redirected you to anime chat and then remembered that you were talking about mice
then i will borrow it
do it
that movie was made in the 70s the rabbit has probably been dead for decades
what about marsunbound?
i prefer jupiter bound
you were suppose to eat it
that’s a guy who needs a haircut
alright
bella!
at least i havent gotten there yet
you already look like a fool
drago
it is not overkill
or maybe he just likes a different kind of cheese
cheese?
you told me benny eats everything
need your help
hmm flubs wanna chase him down for me?
bella
you are my wingman
flubs does not have wings
you can slap gummy with it
thinkingface
get some wings for your wheelchair
flubs only has left hands
well at least we know its an int
next you should accidentally download skyrim
god damn
my gf wants me to play kingdom hearts
didnt you two break up?
and threaten to unleash 50 people on the ex
imma slap ya
this was her ex bf
people are gonna be idiots online
not her
i challenged him to a duel
i haven't
i fight dirty
i can answer that one for him
i know
man i love war
i got war games to play as well
my relationship is save
happen before
of course it is. if they didnt help the person wouldve died
there are many ways to check a problem
right?
i like this one
it took me twice as long as building the shape to add the letters
whats your username
i did this same exact way i did another similar problem but im getting results that dont make sense
is it 40 feet horizontally or parallel to the slope?
come back
my calc was in bloody radian mode
the way they phrase the questions bothers me
i foudn out what i did wrong
well so far i am going to bronycon i get to meet lots of my friends and my mod friends
i give up
it is
697.0 then
good thing drago isn’t a friend
imma scare you
guess who almost typed their brokerage account id and password into discord again
stupid shit or just annoying?
nah not demeaning enough
cats decided to make me play contortionist in bed for 2 hours
i made my point
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
that sounds like a once-ever-five-year event
welcome
i guess youre right
gotta love having a monopoly on mideival bitcoin
also it only has one u
you rang
yeah thats what i thought when it ran on hotel wifi
why is gummy a fridge?
i guess i should get used to that
i tried to scare them
honestly, i want to see what a miniture devourer of gods would be like. <:lul:305559915714576385>
it's why i didn't suggest krpg.
as in pre 1.0.
you hook the rods onto the enemy or boss and it deals damage every period of time as determined by the weapon.
i havent been ale to get bits from ads since the time it'd give me like 1000 bits at a time like a year or so ago
i think they just dont care about the feature actually existing on a free version so they dont bother bug fixing for it
i've gotten top of my team for the past 6 games, all of which were losses
like i said
when did i do that
you sure youre not playing league?
don't burn the place down
im finally home from the teen titans go movie
meant majestic not you
did you pet the cat
so im traumatized since i took my friend to the movies and i let her text my gf for some girl talk
i check the convo after and it was all about putting makeup on me and making me wear a dress
errrr
well i always wanted to see what a dress feels like
exactly

last night was on the complex plane and demovire's theorems and today is about vectors and ellipses
basically z = r(cosθ + i sinθ) and v = ai + bj and *trying to remember general form of an ellipse*
mmkay
oh nice, which final subject is it
i would ask someone out except the said person i could ask out is currently nonexistent
did i hear history
well my gf lives in the uk but i can make long distance happen
dont beat yourself up bella, i believe at you
btw side tangent i saw someone wrongly say "i believe in you" and said "i believe at you" and i refuse to say the correct way
what. is free on youtube. they're both on netflix
well thats fine, you might bump into someone better
they could actually turn out to be someone you might not like so it’s a safer option
okay
either that or you'll die alone
also don’t be desperate for one
one reason i won’t be able to hold a relationship is most women will want kids at some point. and i hate children and i never want to take care of one. you can see where that will lead mr
well
i don't like work
unless you are like me and actually didn’t trust your gf
relationships are always hard if youre not 100% ready to be in a relationship, or not sure how to approach it
not all
until you realize you were being an idiot
gummy ive given you the relationship talk so many times how do you not get it
what the fuck
stop being picky
so i was afraid that was the reason
rad(-1)
youre lying
im nothing like gummy
and im not sure how this one has the most likes but here it goes ```perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.```
alright heres an easy one
there was a 2017 gummy?
well ida in runs in he family
i like insane
hey rc let me let you in on a little secret
when you do it you just come off looking like a dick
i heard the mets lost 25-4 the other day
this isnt baseball
i ate it
but it was trending on twitter
thanks
i don't know
thats dlc
yes 😛
~~i think throwing him out the window would be better~~
hey gummy what's your mouse up to
i don’t even watch baseball at all <:keepo:327304799919800321>
maybe
plus tax
that is like a drago response
im shoving off for the night don't etc. the place down bye
is it squid being an immitator or dragonite doing stuff thats easily immitatable
i’m just the unoriginal guy who copies everything
what
its not doing enough for me
i will say, i’m liking earthbound, but some parts just don’t hold up
listen to music?
ohhh ideepoo we still need to play civ one day
well im sorry i don’t have enough energy to do what i did last year
you’re dirty
p = w/s

also, my opinion on video editing is that, why learn video editing when you can put the time into learning something like photoshop
ahh yes, frame-by-frame editing
is what i think it's called anyways
a simple version of photoshop for $100
i have the 2018 version
gummy can't you have a pokémon picture or something normal like that
my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio
glad to see you alive
do you think ida would be happy to know that i started getting into the fate(?) series? 🤔
whats new with you?
congrats 🎉
online or irl
it's gonna be tough but i think i can handle it
this was the girl i told you about that force her old bf to be transgender and me
drago why are you my mouse?
not the war stuff
that is um that is me
as well
i haven't played in like 3 months
someone eli5 what the point of league is
i'll explain it one word
that's what i thought
but who knows.
imma dinosaur
it's like drago 1500 and gummy 8
well she just out smarted me and said storm 10 gummy 0
all because i didn't know what national meant
i know that i am aware of everything that i am aware to know about it
master go away
flubs you are not invited to the wedding then
i dont think either if them are getting married
go to eyan's wedding
so you will never marry sarah?
fucking hell god no
he told me he wants to get married
you aren't taking my throne
because both of us are fully aware our relationship wont last. we agree on just about nothing and our personalities dont match well
and thats fine, neither of us are in it for a long term thing
drago my heart is not for you
<:gwdogawoophotoblob:402874215759609867>
no drago
a long term relationship is emotionally and mentally taxing as hell
you need the perfect person to make it work and even then theres like a 90% chance youll learn to resent them
dude i already had trust issues with her
so that is good
shes pretty much an objectively bad person but thats ok
so never
im at the nicest ive ever been in my life
acceptance
i was suppose to love him
um you can't do anything though
treason
you would be in gum/pony territory
gummy stop stealing zealians
i dont remember their names describe them
well regal is no longer a zealian

idk what you are talking about
and yet you're still here
master there is no place i get to troll but here
i can't picture serious gummy for some reason
i am not
hmmm well i am tired master
since i am royal
good idea
bella dont encourage him
also i am breaking wedding traditions
and the guy has a best man
well screw the best man
which will be ida
but a kid can dream
no you are negative in general with my decisions
what about me?

and 535 hours on pc all together

also i just looked at my sleep schedule and in 4 days im gonna have to be at a mini physics course right in the middle of when i usualyl sleep
i hugged ida

there are other planets
flubs youll be dead before we extract gas let alone have permanent settlements on another plane
for once you dont take the stupid side
phones didnt exist back then
they did but they were affixed to the walls
let it happen
traitor
something you did to me
no, he’s a fridge
thats like half of a train's interior for one section of the thing
senran kagura: peach beach splash isn't much better.
gummy, plug yourself in. you’re ruining the orange juice
man i love super mario world
okay let the birds eat it
flubs arent you in italy time why are you awake
