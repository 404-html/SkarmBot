wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
fine fine
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
﻿<:Nay:327308337706434570>

gummy i will destroy you if i have to
i haven't watched a movie in a long time

hopefully once we get some more life crystals we'll be able to take down eow faster.
and your name is rarity now
all 3
that should be accurate
get that checked out
my pasta
okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
yes ida
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
i don’t even know what that is
that means you swung to attack.
flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night
now i want pizza...
i can't tell who raised the hand on mobile
heh heh you see what i did there?
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
perfect ida
the p stands for "public", silly goose
i have one pencil tho
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
i dont really care what quality its in
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.
waffles or pancakes
yay my uk friend finally woke up
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
so i dont like the beach
we died so many times to it
and we're still in easymode
nah i don't feel like keeping track
because it is soooo important for me to self promote myself
talk about that
i question if ida ever watched myself
i will show you the cock
i'm not trying to sound offensive but y'all seem kinda trict
damage?
what other browser would u use?
i didn't know that you were you
....
i meant blackmail becoming blackma- shit nevermind that doesnt work
im constantly on here and not even up to date on the spreadsheets i made for one of the classes. not doing anything officially extracurricular.
i’ll make the knife go away
sooooo

i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
wait you guys actually think that's actually that bad?

previous mistakes were repeated
i can't at this point master
peter the great
although i just lost connection
e!says-add i don't know what to do, its working!
it's fine, wolve.
it was probably the fries that gave you away
not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
krelian, please. ^_^;
i'm kicking overhaul out for the next server
it used up every single free bit of space on my drive
oh fuck
taking a break from playing 2 hours of blazblue.
not even close.
i can imagine the banner having stickfigures in it now
like the soc.
canterlot equestria
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
i'll tell you about flubs pm
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
heartgold and soulsilver

bollocks
that isn't me
owo drago hitting his bad bot with a rod
the paul brothers are loud. you want more of them?
he also is attracted to me
they just subbed to me and followed me on twitter
i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
are you talking to me in the last message flubs?
~~ill have fun hehe~~
you have a biased sample
and who cares if it’s fictional
money chest
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
its gotta be true
rarity pkushie made in the uk
henlo wolve
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
idk never played it either lol
everyone said it
just not as much as actual smoking
when you least expect it
just stand there while everyone dances
no, it is literally the opposite
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
platinum was the last game to have it
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
at least she thinks im lovely
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
coffee drinker
we all did
it just might overhaul though.
that's the smell of nature, you fool
they charge money for use of the mods content.
that's a good idea.
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
so if i had to guess
currently alone in a very empty quiet hallway
nothing happen to me
college
ehh effort
yes rc go ahead with the snarky
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
2 was meh
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?
physics is evil

garlicoin, actually
i see someone tried to murder squid again
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
...what?
or maybe it was alyssa
get to it
like this
the windows 10 hard drive wants to confirm alll the integrity stuff, exactly as expected
hey guys i have an idea

oh no im not brave enough for politics
mine would be a remix of nuclear fusion.

but like...its gonna get hot. and when its hot its loud
so its micspam time. got it.
i'm still in pre-hardmode xp

i'm not going to be held responsible for the death of the bot
it reminded me of you
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
damn it
"the funeral is at 6:00, please be on time"ypoo
doesnt help me figure out who tf owns the discord beta testing server tho
actually, going to her concert in a couple months 😄

yeah, we do
owo this is interesting
did i miss something
great now i have self-confidence issues
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
i don't want there to be too much lag
i dont want those nsfw ones tho
fibus lusec wecos vinosec
i needed that after dinner snack
now it's a force schedule your video
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
everything?
you already do, ninny
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
good
so i don't have to do that ^^^
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
you are not joining
i do
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
we already know what you're gonna pick tho
~~one of us. one of us.~~
how dare somebody play my champ
i'm afraid to join vc xp
i'm sculpting models right now, squid.
i wonder what other rank ups could’ve been
when

i see.
the world doesn't revolve around you, gummy.
!rank
it is
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~
remember magic wand
i love hnnngggg-ing
i arrive back
that too lol
oh hey, you're dunban now, rc?
drago is the winner
my tradition is just not watching the game
damn misspelling...
darn
what game is it?
so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
e!bot
they let you on phones last year in spare
a bit of both?
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
plus a server which is connected to the dm
pot meet kettle, gummy
my catchphrase is better
did i just walk in on something here
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
goood gummy
let me guess: same person?
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
never most likely
how goes things?
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
no no lets
banked garlic bread from ~~scratch~~ raw ingredients
doesnt mean he cant react with them
dazzling is next at school then
i thought it was fairly obvious :c

<:wutface:327309186432237569>
said you were
huh?
you dissapoint me and i leave now
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
<:treason:396483914803445761>
yeah
use sylveon lol
“prick”
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
i didn’t. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
i already promise not to have a huge freakout ever since the october 8th 2016 at 7pm incident
okay then
ill throw one ultra ball
maybe flubs but i know how to handle most of the situation
asus
no squid that’s inappropriate
same
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
what do you guys feel about randomizers
i could have done 1804 or 1815
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
no kill me
there's another good response
doit
we need a quarantine
true true probably when i get idk 1000 views...likes that’s going to happen lol
what kind is it?
amazing how many costumes he can layer up
possibly
seen the escape rope fail yet?
you know who was also a good tsar?
oops caps
also a few milling subscribers and a thriving youtube channel but that's beside the point.
kk cya
and now it's rubbing it in. <:lul:305559915714576385>

well go do it then, i'm too lazy to do it

brb doing garlic bread cinematography
sup nerds
i dont even remember posting that
<:coolstorybob:327305348698603520>
oh...
well i get it
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
also on the subject of ports secret of mana just got a steam remake, anyone know if it's any good? (it's getting pilloried by the reviews)
i also like just drunk ideas in general
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early

but fallout 4 really is better
i cant get food out of my fridge

where is he?
oh darn i missed a stream
they're glitchy
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
but are we eating the chicken?
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
i should get it, but again...lazy
it's just getting better and better.
iirc
you can stop with your pickup lines now
connection issues
definitely
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much
i wanna get an inkay though
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
because it works
yup master jinx me

maybe
until today
mystery dungeon explorers of sky is stupid
that's my job
did you see godzilla blow up the mailman?
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs
time to level up
maybe. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i kind of don't hang out here anymore
sometimes it takes 2 seconds other times its like half an hour
hey will
i dont know how to respond
i ordered two...
wait nvm he got caught more than once
it sounds interesting
though i don’t think you will give me a wand
yeah thanks
thank you
skarm does not want battle revolution
i don’t like ghestsis.
yup twitch support is on it
those are tasty things which in this scenario overrules important
the kappa
those
like
n is awesome
<:lul:305559915714576385>
make that dark chocolate and i'm in
well i once got my butt kicked when i played on emperor mode in civ
<:lul:305559915714576385>
wait a second
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
that took years to make
no skarm turn yourself in!
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
yay!
i return with cake
well if he constantly says he’s 11 and to leave him alone because he’s young but acts like 11
why have you been doing that up to now?
lol yup
now let's try this gif
i hope i find someone someday who is extremely untidy and can't cook for shit
i was never a true zealian
botw > skyrim
fuck you, flubs
ehh you capitalized it so my code says it's completely different
what is wrong with me this week?
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
nintendo should make all the main pokémon games available on either the 3ds/wii u virtual console or if the switch ends up getting a virtual console
!image twitch lol
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
i think
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era
turns out, if the subs don’t watch x amount of videos as they come out, they just straight up don’t get notified of the video
should i set the starting counter to like 2?
ok, who was the queen disguised as in the phantom menace?
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
i try to have a 10-7 sleep schedule.
then have someone else do it
skarm knows all
how so?
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
now what?
remember screw the brits, screw the danes, and fuck prussia
~~i can play the clarinet~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it’s a union

also i love how i say women take forever as my pfp literally shows that...
do you have boss checklist enabled?
we need you to throw some people for squid
did everyone hear what happened with doublelift
i still havent done the golden claw sidequest
depends on the weekday
nice
nothing
two wine glass
i love gossiping for some reason
holy fuck everything in switzerland is expensive
here's what i know regarding those 3 distros.
felt like touhou on like, normal-to-hard
is this the game-wide record?
~~and lags you if you don't have a good pc.~~
maybe the game hates me
crashed again.
so must make an anthem
she insinuated some very rude things about my ancestors being related
dammit skarm
oooh its a party in commons
dessert
no flubs
they have a food about it
okay, that's kinda great.
at least it kept recording
the quest should still be in your to do list tho
did you see drago?
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
:feelsannoyingman:
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
uh oh.
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
wowsa.
was there 8 of them? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
later, squid.
boring
hey, i was going to eat that squid
remember kids, always make the best use of your situation
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
because they feel like it
please dont blow up dan

what story
ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow

oh dear

the ocean one?
i’m back from work ya ninnies
unless his discord username is different now.
avicii was just found dead
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
no, that is incorrect

<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
argonian?
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
this is healthy
hmmm
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
good luck with that
good job
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
won't have to do those things for another year
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
do i get another trophy for level 60?
you fit right in here. =w=
no you just havent caught up with death yet
just the one.
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
the formula was n² + n - 1
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
why are we talking about trees now
or given my personal rating
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
assholes need lessons taught to them
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
looks like java doesn't care master lul
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
alright, cya have fun
how would you plug that in?
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>

sounds devastating
gummy can i be your best friend
two things
but hes made of alcohol

how did the count rise to 5 tho?
that sounds even worse
in the 3ds version sarah keeps beating me as jigglypuff
>ida has been playing skyrim for 5 hours
i could get work done
chocolate chip would just mean generally anything that isnt vanilla
gummy arent you the one with the super fancy gaming pc
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
nice
yeah close enough on the zeroes
when was i supposed to learn this shit
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
just finished physics class
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
that chaos!
it's great
ah hah
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity
"don't get me wrong, i love lamp".
and then went rogue.
i’d do it if i felt well

wanna try it
i'm was never hired
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
what were the questions?
thats me, baby
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
i’m back from work ya ninnies
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
never timed it though
and only assholes do that
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
it’s fun
because only high quality shitposts make it through
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
no, square the temperature
what do you think?
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
i kinda wanna frame it
then you are safe
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
go faster than camera take picture
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
yeah, i think that’s important
something about technicians
im a doof
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
3+4=5
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
why?
i think 5-24-25 is also one
welp
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
idk who to pick though
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
same
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
like doubling numbers
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
theres those junimo huts you can get
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
it's not like the class is experimental
oh grad party will be safe
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
yeah we know
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
~~phanpy.~~
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place
yaya
it was only 20%?
windows 3.1
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
we talked about the art of history

thanks you broke both my hands
currently counting 435 photos

i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
1930s?

modern rap is like saying classical music
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
how about chant du départ
they make such satisfying noises when they die
it's just my phobias make the game hell for me
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
i just don’t care about action movies. except maybe deadpool
a tnt a day keeps the doctor away
remember when i pirate stuff

my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
i just got back onto discord
jokes on you i'm on summer break

he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
anyways where was i?

dont get dragonite started on faces
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"

gummy stop getting deatroyed
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
woah now no need to cuss
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money

you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
not in that order
but still i'm hyped!
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
or try to hit from far away
no part
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
of course ive only seen like 4
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
it just was pointless at the same time
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
i don't think it was bad.
for not being faithful to the original
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
e3 was fuckin boring
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself

i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
you know what
or a glock
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
but you wouldn't last
boom
welp

master
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard

cpu model?
i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
good to know
mom wasn’t supposed to go with dad and sister to the city but i guess they did

spring and fall have allergies though
holy fuck
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
la familia went to italy a few years ago
hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
i meant the former best friends list
that gummy is crazy?
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
drago sounds like a robot
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
well this is the other super tower on this site
no gummy
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
how come i still do?
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
oh i called one of the mods in a server "favourite little mod"
of teeny tiny pizza
there's no max level anymore
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore

....
big brother feature
you always agree with me
it’s fun <:keepo:327304799919800321>

i don’t wanna video edit
but um
my stuff came
dead yes
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
and there was one more?
ever since he collab and made friends with people
1327 for me
drago's forum friends got the boot
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
why do you think i leave this place all the time?
oh hes offline

so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
he’s a great guy
never heard of him
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
what server?
nobody does
you can guess which one this is
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
i have my own bad counter this time around
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
why's that?
have you injested enough of your namesake
i need to get in my pc again
k both hard drives are good
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
that’s just a toaster
while others say i don’t
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
they're good for your health
what about those bean boozled ones?
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school

windows products
hang on
in this windy old weather
well
rainy here
what is the music of life?
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
whats your point?
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
but made with science
and they did great though was hard through discord
get rainy to talk to you
well you better send pics
that should speak for itself
it was just interesting to look back
every ten levels
lucky you
give me a dollar
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team
i got attacked by a rabbit
thinkingface
so im kinda like you now
theres no way i havent mentioned that
im actually really surprised
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
var spl=message.split(" ");
we figured it out
i mean uh
no bad
~~we’re all just crazy~~

welcome to the world of airplanes
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
because it will cost $2000
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.

i’ll take his apology as a surrender
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
oh that reminds me

my calc was in bloody radian mode
697.0 then
alright
guess who almost typed their brokerage account id and password into discord again

cats decided to make me play contortionist in bed for 2 hours
gotta love having a monopoly on mideival bitcoin

yeah thats what i thought when it ran on hotel wifi
why is gummy a fridge?
i tried to scare them
you hook the rods onto the enemy or boss and it deals damage every period of time as determined by the weapon.

relationships are always hard if youre not 100% ready to be in a relationship, or not sure how to approach it
well

alright heres an easy one
what the fuck
ooh we talkin bout exams
but it was trending on twitter
i don't know
im shoving off for the night don't etc. the place down bye
also, my opinion on video editing is that, why learn video editing when you can put the time into learning something like photoshop
my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio
when you do it you just come off looking like a dick
i ate it
imma dinosaur
what
it's like drago 1500 and gummy 8

you aren't taking my throne
im at the nicest ive ever been in my life
someone eli5 what the point of league is
idk what you are talking about
i can't picture serious gummy for some reason
shes pretty much an objectively bad person but thats ok
um you can't do anything though
remember
which will be ida
good idea

hmmm well i am tired master
when you get back

"water wont work because its *somewhat* water *resistant*"
i’m back from work ya ninnies
and bad news
why would i be a home
gummy it's too early in the morning for this nonsense
that should be an option
drago
good news i get to meet her irl sooner than expected
and either way arguing is a sign of a healthy relationship, not an unhealthy one
see my stomach is not my weakness
i got a new mission
lets see how long this lasts before mee6 flips it back
soon enough that collection's gonna have an integer overflow or something
drago
he also has a pretty extensive wikipedia page
flubs i don't like you
im shoving off bye
or go
lower cost making + higher cost selling  = more profit
what in god's name is going on in here
flubs
but its been a while since i've had a full load of courses to deal with so
they deserve it though
most peoples first phone is an iphone
lately i've noticed i dont really procrastinate assignments but i'll procrastinate everything else like my daily stretches for example
brb then
i don't think so
i'm calling the canadian equivalent of the fbi to put a giant magnet on your hard drive

i have no idea what that is 🎉
it’s not too old
no idea
laptop?
also thing
sorry gummy
that's like
no i meant something akin to this type of it
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
im gonna try weekly next
god damn it he's been infected also
the relatively saine weekly version
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
nice
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
thankfully rhino helps a lot
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing
its pretty much a video thing
its just an oversight but yknow
i didnt want you anyways
too many password attempts

that's a line they can access
there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
you had to do that before?
feelsbad
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
no downsides.
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
link.
oh cool
i mean like
its best is an idiot
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
what's the link there for?
omg drago looks lame
i’m back from work ya ninnies
e sharper pointy stick
in 3
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
i read part of the book and i have to say
6 maybe?
i stopped going in december
college is stupid
i have one
nah go ahead
algebra is fun
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
that sucks
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
that's like the same thing right
and that was just to test a thing for eyan
i'll take that as a yea
ah, gotcha
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
if the new program was written properly it doesn't care what the file extension is, and just reads the header data in it to figure out how to parse it
thats where the secret money comes in
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
whats that the code for?
they won 1 and 3
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
did google give you the answer you wanted to see
which quest?
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
yeah
but that really is me
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
a little
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i like how everyone doesn't even comment on gummy's name anymore
we've just been so used to it to the point where it's just normal.
which one was the one where... ah shit i dont remember any
and no drago
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp
i already wave a white flag
this is the original video
i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
question answer
you said so
he does that in every episode
whyyy
stream?
\:thinking\:
my mom is ready

oh god i glitched the plains
it ended up hitting my leg hard
oh they're league teams
game borders are fun
no you don't
since supergummying is a curse name on youtube
huh. now im just gone in general
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
you just can't youtube
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
its not raining, no
the plot's thickness isolates
sorry.
i do!
most of what i remember of early calc is basically revolving around the unit circle
is it supposed to be raining?
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
but you will most likely break up before then
i don’t remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
thank you
oh sorry to hear that
interesting
no she only has 514 points to your zero
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
i know
lies
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
no, i'm icelandic
eh, it might sound like that
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
either way wossman also said it
why is gummy benny?
yeah, let's go with that
i don't drink coffee
is she cute?
<:mhxsleepy:362261093998919680>
that is dr wossname
i never swear
help
dont think it works that way
what does it mean to not feel tired
i need a new gummy
its not the most noble strat but its one that works
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
at least it works
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
gonna need some axi's for that to work first

ooooh nice
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
no college for me on thursdays 👀
how dare they
about?
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
physics is fun tho
huh.
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
press f for kugal
i love this university now
fuck no
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
also he allows students to collect data together on laboratory assignments
and drago no
greetings, bella.
nice
like 20 minutes over due
thats the answer im going with
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
can i visit>
for x/x
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
okay
sounds like a swell time
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
what
nice
watch me
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
from what i've heard and observed
i'm not talking about the observable universe. all i'd say is that if the rest of the universe is not observable, why would we come to the conclusion that it's infinite?
and when you divide anything by zero you get infinity
keep learning
maybe that was the universe also
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
let me go to sleep now
unconvinced of what, im confused lol
why the hell was i testing live streams yesterday?
arguably
huh. just finished reading eldest
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
i'm over halfway through the day
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
and apparently the monado had a hidden monado and that hidden monado had a secret dickson that had a hidden monado. and now my head hurts
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
mkay..maky..
thats confusin to me
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
oh okay
delicate is playing
holy moly
so yeah
spazzer the great
and how strong they emphasis that course
some courses last six months

seems like besides eyan
once done with these league games gotta farm reactant

"258 in an 8bit system"?
solve p=np
pat friend?
they have to
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
yeah no
no clue
there is a solution
that wacky character is a radicand
or the existence sign?
why not use +
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
i always had a hunch
yea pretty much
says you
i have a question
i used to be smart you know
yee?
me too
so yep
well
computers usually cant handle a lot of errors
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know
welcome to canada
and you *pay* for it to be harder
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want

no clue
good lord
i know that
glad to see you missed me
one sec
i was briefly very confused by that statement
all the surv missions have equal drop rates
im getting close to having enough for all frames
do you still need any mesos?
thats a no go
works for me
am doing a calculus lesson
in what context?
being social is the worst

great now i have some racer's life insurance
papa john's is bad
i didn't want pizza
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
absolute zero breaks physics
thats just when everything gets boring
youre asking me to change chairs, find the thing, come back, switch chairs again, and then talk hushed like so i dont wake sarah up
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
yeah exactly
once the uncertainty principle fails
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
i like breaking physics
somewhere
apple products are gross
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
everything changes mass
somewhere
so its a function and not a method, got it

dragon resists stupid
its healthbar went from 100-0 as soon as the cry for help went down
also pretend to be the reverse flash if you feel like it
red is nicer tho tbh
but its not midnight yet

i should just ask if i can get all of the papers for the homework/labs/midterm/final right now and turn them all in next week, and not show up for the rest of the semester

i got a message from tatsu to do my homework but im just wasting time instead
atlantic
stop messing up the universe, it's unhealthy you idiot
i'm doing my homework
okay who stole my bagel bites???

they can if they try really really hard
and thats the start of skynet
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
the moon to where
did someone say dog?
i dont think
is that a yes or a no?
hello there
someone lost the sign
imma look at my next calculus lesson
holy moly it's a short lesson too
like wasting time
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
it tastes like stale nothing
neato
you're a plant?

i dont mind english
can confirm
and im still horrible
if you get understood who gives a fuck
what
oh no, now he's ripping off animal\_man\_.
what
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
did it have victory road music?
i technically sent someone somethign nsfw once
that's all im gonna say on that matter
work takes away my motivation to do anything
if i was friends with only emotionally chaotic people
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
im just worried that my family will disown me when they find out im dating a transgender
welp
so i'm worried
mugged then shot
so how is my replacement?
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
kinda
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
no it's just a big lava lamp
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
no just the comic pages
im serious

my physics teacher roasted me today
that's fun too
there was also pizza and i drank a bit too much lukewarm tea
if this was fight club
why is that surprising
what game can we play together
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
oh i guess i did
do people not do that
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful 🤗
how so
oh shit
i wanna fight andi now
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-

plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
something like that
it's been a long time
but no one ever asked for my solution
fuck yeah
thats the best name

i don’t like them either

well, more like 2

bite sells for a nice chunk of plat and forma is self explanatory
they’re more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
depending on what you mean on hole, sure
oooh
i like this green fellow
here too
or were you thinking yu-gi-oh and you though of the pieces?
its a 3 letter word, do you expect it to never come up in conversation?

you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
kugal why are you in an english class
wouldnt that make it harder to digest
i imagine that's relatable
i enjoy english
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
that's a noni

exponential derivatives are that easy?
go play with your cat or something
it's strong
but then i realize i probably was being mean
well go get a cat

also i like this part of the chart
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
i thought all moms did this - no not really
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
plus i cant drive cos im a moron, lol
i wish i could say the same
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
i like that
appreciate it buddy
wait
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
100%on stat test woop woop
ouch
nintendo direct just happened
whomst aboot
good
also good job
hooray for books and food
you just answered your own question
a what did a what and played what and where was i
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
that's a good amount
you know i said in the literal sense
my goodness
whats the advantage of online classes
oh cool whens that coming out
anyway, for warframe, i've heard rumors about that going on the switch, so i'm not too surprised with it going on the thing plus it's on every current gen console thus far
~~xenoblade x~~
i know mario maker hasn’t
i gotchu squid
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
plaaaaaaay something else
they kinda have ongoing costs
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
im actually rewiring slon to be 2% cleaner
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
nice
so why not put your games on the money printer
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
axi s3 and v7, specifically
how do you think that is?
and the answer checker liked to do things like mark `x=5 m/s` wrong because it was looking for something like `x = 5 m/s`
decisions, decisions
i should just learn to code in my sleep
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
fuck it
just looked at it. it’s crazy how far and wide it hits the east coast
so i have an english essay tomorrow
i just spend my day off doing all of my homework
hmmm
definitely
you dedicate one day to homework?
i need problems to invent stuff to solve for a class

thats the time that matters
i got a good insult
fair enough
nope
learning games
he wouldnt take the thing with him
so much frigging effort
today i learned that dippin dots has its own cereal.. :
who's good with computers here btw?
with nothing to play it on because when i suggested i get the ps2 that was $10 more than it instead and i told her i only had one game she said to get another game
whatcha up to
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
no effect
i really need a better rhino set up 🤔
nope
i need a sister that fits under my category
if i ever make fun of your code style again just remind me that you have a twelve-year-old sister
oh the horror
your dog making cat noises
me hungry
my hearing is pretty bad
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun

hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
i too like panada's
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
good job windows
why is that even a question
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
did someone say chickens
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
hey master fun fact: you're at least 85% of the fact i don't believe in the pc master race
you should joint he party
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
bye pnada
demon lord why must you encourage gummy thus
flubs let's be honest
exactly
master are you compensating for something
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
in other news dogs in cars are fun
master stop being stupid, demon lord stop trying to argue with stupid
its not a toggle
i update it monthly
no i mean like all the other people who are red you cant see it
i played as waluigi i think
hello hello hello lol ^w^
i have officially bandwagon from tsm to c9
you can only trade primes
be at worlds
or an array of booleans
to what degree of certainty do you say that
i believe so
i mean
bella and aminal
today “drop the whole fucking team”
now i'm getting flashbacks to chessmaster 9000.
nice
which is their week 1
i just import it to gimp
got 3/5 becuase of the screwed up questions
hey kugal
thats about what i expected
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
can you display that to three significant digits?
hey kugal
two hours until class starts and i dont have anying to do and my phone's on 30%
yesterday “we are gonna 3-0 c9 and crush everyone at worlds”
see pins
good job discord mobile
trynig to get boltor prime now
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
i was charging it and totally forgot about it
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
maybe
what skarm
they weren't very easy essays either
i didnt do any of that yesterday anyway
im with you gummy
can i have any leftover tacos?
mission so far successful
i agree
thats where we get tacos
did someone say tacos
what are the reqs?
a massacre
complete a survival mission with level 30 or higher enemies without killing anyone
i just don't know if the mod itself is good
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i'm in the mission
i prefer that
i havent been paying attention
much easier
this does not bode well
trippy smooth version
darn
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
be nice flubs
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
anyways brb playing aatrox
four to seven pages
yeah
nice
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
well who knows maybe i deserve it
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
oh cool so the new 2000 series cards are a waste of time
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can’t buy and have no use for
ah, gotcha
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
they also have metal
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>

sure
write about a space ninja

previews are nice sometimes
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
e!wolfram 13 gmt
and drago can be a guest on the show
~~good point.~~
he comes every two weeks
i had someone in my server thinking the nazis were good...how does this happen in a non public server
i googled it and wish you luck draco bc i wouldn’t know how it’d go together either
let people major how they wanna major
how was i supposed to know drago
it's like forcing a biologist to write a paper on physics
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
who had the changed
it missed obviously.
tmw your code doesnt work all afternoon and you finally figure out why
but still
i'm in the middle of figuring out how to use the wikipedia api to generate content for my homework assignment for me
firefox > chrome anyways
i got 1 fact wrong on my astronomy lab and that dropped the grade by 10%
for three hours
nothing
ham is gross
and they sell for more typically
i can't believe i got all of ember's stuff in the minimal possible runs
lemonade
when i met him i was more successful
fuck
oh yeah that one was hard
it's true, grades k - 8th i literally didnt know anything
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
oh hell no
often 8 +
i’m not into the camera work at aaaaallll
yea if you're getting a phd you're basically saying you want to stay in school until you're like 30 +
my mom went back to school at 36
i remember back in 2nd grade i really liked ham and cheese sandwiches
or editor
remember stay single and don’t do hard drugs
go for it
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
ha ha
im not single
drago
there is tension
hah. time zones.
gotta do 5 waves with objective taking no damage on lvl 30+
woo 100% on astronomy test
kavat cudes up rn if you need them
i did use a spreadsheet to check myself though
damn sleep
or maybe just that boy with the hat
how is that going?
it's the sylveon pfp
too bad i still have no idea how to get bacon in this game
i want the frame for myself but im probably not gonna go all out like for rhino
first day of fall and it should be 90+
just get my sister to entertain her
what
25th
she is sick though
:dragonitewasamistake:
but then again driving on li looks horrible
unfortunately the people who do drunk driving and road rage also happen to be the people who are least likely to give up their keys
sorry to hear that flubs
~~wasn’t the internet always stupid?~~
same
i just gave you a much better name for it
im guessing itd just be the factorial of the factorial of the original number
through x^.5 form or?
man one assignment for literature takes a few solid hours, its impressive
don’t know yet
yea i think i may just use double factorial
i’ve come to realize i’d rather be happy and doing what i like than be unhappy and dreading work everyday
who?
oh yeah peaceful places
i should teach kids war
play them my songs in return
stellacor
how the fuck will more music help me hear less music
i’ll let you know
gummy dont you have anything better to do
basically i am gonna take everything i learn over the years for this
what are your pc specs?
no, flubs is the demolition expert
no joke
but i have stat work
i had curly fries
on a closed interval
i ran ivara stuff way too much
iirc i got pretty lucky with t3
3 teralysts, one gantalyst, and one hydrolyst
its a t3r3 low chance drop
after 7 more missions than shouldve happened
i have a key left if you two want to use it
i started watching during pokémon diamond
it's my sister's
that being said i am going to buy a 3ds when i get a job
thanks!
win + x -> u -> r
that's really sad
nice
wait switch _is_ ninth gen
imagine paying $2000+ for a phone and still not getting a fast charger
oh wait my sub expired
what the crap it's autumn now?
yeet selling out is awesome
you don't
well thats why we call it a raspi usually
wow this is.. a lot
there are phones that cost over $2000?
its just slush
not looking forward to walking to the bus stop in -20 weather tho
no squid would be playing it on a smart window
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
the people you go on discord with
to mot
i nearly died
something bad happen
allows you to take an aura like corrosive projection
zenurik is super strong energy regeneration
what's the challenge?
it’s cool that they gave a riven
that takes skill
gonna try to sleep now
and now that you can hunt teralysts you also have arcane buffs to start collecting
like +30% strength
sounds fun
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
you say that like it's a good idea but then you realize steam games take a month to patch/download there
as per usual
guys
i think you mean a shit ton
assuming the butt is predominantly meat with a small layer of fat
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
minus the "social" part
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
gonna go watchwestwing();}
on every site
they can *do* that?
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
that's what "formatting" means right
break time
how long is break time?
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
make what a thing
i dont think this one has a right answer
i sent the prof an email about it too
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
and when you die it stops being your problem
mines on the top
<:rooduck:399827506665881600>
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
basically
it's all mems
they're an emerging marketplace right now
as you know, fred
that was master's bad idea not mine
actually
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated
yes yes yes yes
16,318,782
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
i still don’t get why they are a thing
woah
rc have you even _seen_ this guy's content
but like how dont they have guns in skyrim
i love the 18th century
thank you
gouda?
great, now i'm tempted to watch crash course videos for the rest of the night
no notifications except for the guy who i'm trying very hard to avoid
ahoy
sweden is a myth
damn i want to do that now
master know anyone who hates receiving letters?
oh yeah in dark brotherhood questline you murder the emperor while hes on his ship
thats probably how the fcc feels about public comments tho too
virginia tech? yeah they sent me recruiting information well into my twenties also
oh i forgot that i blocked mee6
also my nose runs
indeed.  welcome to our little slice of discord.
take the easy option in this case
my first class gives quizzes exactly at the start.. it sucks
oh yeah and we had a mini argumentative piece in gov that most people wrote over a page for. i wrote half a page talking out of my ass and got 6/6 on it
glad to see everyone doing well
no thanks i just ate two slices of terrible pizza
vote'); drop table candidates --;
that sounds cruel and unusual
get the dynamite
it's cold therefore it's christmas
bella want some terrible pizza? the school cafeteria has more of it than they know what to do with
i remember we got papers or something about it in high school but i never read them
sounds good
this whole mornings real odd
then again
hey theres plenty other things to talk about
exactly
maybe if you throw it fast enough you can knock out the power cord or something
but then it starts becoming unpredictable
very badly
is the new 3ds worth?
i did a really good typo earlier
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
wanna learn history?
with or without the viking swords
but you physically copies are nice for display
is this like part of your morning routine or something
video games
and there are no paper cartridges
thats a first of those
post with a dog in it -> search by controversial
humans are nice
huh, don’t see it
greetings all those who are kind
thanks
hello person
i can inv you
brb pretending to be productive today
me thinks problem is flawed
i did this problem last night
> question 56
so the first piece and second piece should have the same derivative value at x = 0
or you could say a= -2/x
but is it differentiable?
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
or maybe penguins can study gummyology
well if the context of the conversation is "hey dont plow our house down"
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
too late doing calc first
the classes are way tougher than film
gummy what do you _do_ with a film degree anyway
i already am complaining about college
film editor or producer for tv shows before moving on to movies or animation
you arent allowed to touch the penguins
community moreso when you wanna transfer... those reqs are no joke
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it’s the same thing
i mean people in grade 12
that’s awesome
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
i took chem as a senior
final*
well that’s easy
i think the highest for freshman here is bio
im in such a good mood
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
as long as you're careful, rock and roll
is that a good thing or a bad thing
i should probably tag him hun
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
it’s normal probably
you have no valid point
well, have fun
because i do the dumb
it’s not surprising, but official
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question

a high male voice in choir
i got chewed out in first grade

if it was easy everyone would do it
is it bad that i bought the skyrim ost almost four years ago and im still not tired of it
you can do that in real life too
i like it when my code is a metaphor for my entire life
"and here we have dragonite getting his eleventh hour of sleep"
also is it bad that nintendo sent me an email about a pokémon distribution and the pokémon in the picture was completely unrecognizable
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
good job
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
thats the boy
the forecast calls for an undefiend chance of dragonite showing up to stream tonight
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again

snorlax

last i checked thanos helped us clear what was left of their spies out
the homeowner association subreddit?
the who?
i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
no it would probably be the timestamp of the last time the page was edited
the discordie one sucks?
extreme cheap cake?
but it's halloween in a month
it keeps fuckin changing
and slap this one girl at bronycon i hate
yeah

i misread demon lords statement by one letter

but it's due monday
and i was never told to start working on it, only that it was due monday
the great thing about physics is that you don't need words for it to make sense
my friggin college calculus course is easier than my high school honors course
"here's a template lab that someone turned in in 2007, just copy and paste some words and add a table of your results and write me two sentences for why your results don't match mine and you get a 95"
the directions are equal to "ok go and do it have fun!"
my favorite part is when you catch the black hole at just the right angle and you can see an image of yourself without needing a mirror
like spaghetti or people
also what the fuck how do teachers have enough time to grade all this stuff and still make tests and shit
i know only of blitzypoo
alright cool
squid if you die i get your stuff

i could get things done or i could play skyrim
older sisters are hot in anime
but i also looked up to him so that was nice
jk jk
okay no wonder my peanut butter is wet
i realize something
for now
>: (
it's always supposed to be raining somewhere
other than that they expect me to find out really specific details that only websites like yahoo answers or quora seem to know
coffee sucks <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i could not find a single answer
i could not agree more
ask them to double check that they didn't give you ap astronomy homework
dragonite happy
did the disable expiration spell break?
people who like coffee
i just feel like this list is missing a few things
i have one question

bella want me to change your name to "not bella" until november?
like i found this
i have many questions for clyde
\:thinking\:
because it's october
one of my friends convinced me to play borderlands a bunch of time ago
you did this to yourself
if so my faith in the fandom has been both destroyed and resurrected at the same time
no that's fine cereal is gross anyway
what fpsing
it feels great the day after next
theres not that many pink nu to choose from
but now it isnt but you cant say spooky or anything with the word spook in it

i need flubs as general
it's art
right as you say that one of my cats tries to sit on the face of the other
if its the size of pluto

that fuckin fat kid ruined the show
and that is literally the only reason you cannot date her
saturn
wasn't sure if it was canonical or not
thanks this is confusing panda
i was just surprised
i mean this wouldn't be the first time he's attempted to save something
they really should qa test these things better
urgent question: is everclear safe to drink
because i have some and want very desperately to be not sober
and that worked out fine without it (?)
mine is usually somewhere between -100 and 5000
mix it with koolaid
cutting everclear with water?
it can range up to 13, but that's uncommon
i've been doing that for the past four years.
right

why not
but they're well trimmed

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
it's not because women are more emotional
whats it
but there were other reasons for that
cause men are dumb
i'm great at men
i'll stpo
it’s adorable
or goths
you sassy fortune you
i almost fell in love

i’m not down for this
or just... ever
i forget do you watch bnha rainy?
it's like that but an anime
im pretty sure if you read enough bible you could find at least one or two instances of god being a knob to jesus
oh hey
what is the truth
of course gummy loves the soviet era
10/10
my sympathy has been replaced with contempt
he prefers when women were disallowed a voice
dragonite dont do it now
.....
anything with empire is good
feet. horses.
so that age about prolly
thats a lady
he got like salt and pepper hair? cause that's hot

i mean theres no way he *isnt* but its a question of to what extent is he
its fuckin gross
whoossat
but its nice
that sounds like a bad ainime
great so header formatting doesnt work on discord i want a refund
even though i’m not bad at formal essays, doesn’t mean they’re enjoyable
then there's no way to get a refund.
so refund your nitro subscription.``` <:kappa:374346980136058893>
and i’m doing nothing because i’m tired after a day of work
found the perfect efficiency point
let me guess
of bugs
i uh...... no
you've been tricked
who the flip said you could be me? i can't even be me!!!
wait that sounds like a twilight reference
truly unfortunate
did you try turning them off and turning them on again
civil war at this point
-1/dragonite
because si
one of them i’m too sleepy to try.
lvl 30 defense?
theres multiple veiled?
the easy one is 10 slide kills without damage
who here is dumb?
is the frame slot the issue?
i thought there were like
reyn time basically the most well known meme that is not "i'm really feeling it" from that game
ive had that happen twice and waited it out both times
i don't remember seeing one like that either
this one trick is doing great
that might have been a different game though but im pretty sure it was xenoblad
can we hit gummy
he’s gummy as well
you’re doing the world a favor
<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
no he's a predator of gummy
silver 2 21 lp
so i stopped doing it
but i learn an important lesson, that caring is often enough to get us through and to be happy
and then you take us to anime off-brand ice-cream-princess, distinctively not dairy queen
redemption arc’s fine
<:rooaww:399827525599232000>
nvm i just uh <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
grab it asap
that one almost doesn't seem thematically correct
primed pressure point and primed reach are available with baro
my bus broke down 😂
you should make a light novel of this

i need to mod my skyrim
no windows 2000
where's the meme thing
they’re just windows stuff before 7
i use an adblocker so who cares if they target ads
does that matter though
and you wanted to get insurance
if you accidentally broke a table because you didn't know that would happen if you swing an axe on it, that's something you had control of
yeah i did one of those a while ago
like 23andme a
it is friday october fifth gummy
you're hopeless.
i see thanks
enjoy spending money on shit you don't have to because "it's the way capitalism is'
will they break it though
why did my granddad to that
and you didn't know you could get life insurance
there’s more than those
if you can’t fill out a resume without help, how do you expect to live on your own?
i'm not you.
my family does everything for me and i know this shit
just
good fucking lord
eh, probably not going to drink that much anyway
even if i live away from my parents now
i mean flubs she's probably asleep by now so that's a little unfair
statues
drinking age is 19 in my province
this also confuses
if you tell a woman you’re jealous of her beard, you better be ready to get thrown to the moon
thanks though
vsauce! dan here
you have a play skyrim button on your keyboard?
and she didn’t take offence
all of my facial hair is around my neck
my hair is purple
my hair is too fabulous to let go
oh look my xbox controller was just under my desk thats convenient
purple is weird on you
i can't grow anything above my chin
what is your weapon?
at least i think that's the case, i don't know. i'm not a dentist or an orthodontist
solution: get rid of all the teeth
yeah people tend to leave when dragonite shows up
no dragonite is dragonite and gummy is gummy
your body clearly hates it
uninstalling skyrim is illegal
good idea
thanks
i now realize i’ve never played civ so, this should be good
i like aogno di volare
my first baconator squid

what was it out of
you put all your info on a google doc and share it with the corporate email. the entire email
yeah
my favorite
also a lot of the point of school is broadening your horizons and also teaching you to not be an asshole. it fails on both fronts, but you cant really fault them for trying
it helps over time, trust me
all the while english is one of the most useless degrees that it's possible to get
probably in a coma and on life support
it turns out my last brain cell didn't die.
bored right off the bat?
tsm will win worlds...oh wait

85% feels mild, i shouldve gone for the 90% cocoa
samson is who flubs is referring to.
i woke up late
hello hello i think i’ve got a migraine
which is unusual. don’t get those often
great, now i’m hungry
have any idea?
okay, this is going to sound weird but hear me out.
though honestly, haven’t come across that problem
so would that mean like all of his 2869 lines of spaghetti get randomly recombined with someone else's 2869 lines of spaghetti or something
\:thinking\:
is it about skyrim
we're fucked
whats the most outer space sounding song in skyrim

one more hour till thanksgiving
aaaaaa
consider it a rebellion against the smartphone era
yeah let's not
the stuff in it is kind of important but the words inside it are like
balls i need to go to class
when your computer freezes and theres nothing in the event log about it
also not putting ig first in d lul
idk if this should be here or memes but lo;

you mean there are people who _dont_ show their passport when asked for id
sorry to hear that
rip ida
master do you even know the words to ragnar the red
kix once banned someone for copy pasting a question over and over until someone answered. it was great
also you can't argue with your viewers
since if you just ban every person who insults you you're going to have no viewers left
yeah i agree
was i guess
i just need 15 more followers and that 3 average views
you told me to listen to baba yetu
baba yetu is cool

just code triple battles and then copy paste it but subtract 1
good
im sorry
or maybe pokémon battle royale
i don't remember what it is but i know i played it before 14 days of shitstorm
and bella let me know once you watch
it's only like 95% broken

ignore that big bad statement
had a customer that was a pain to deal with; pretty sure he was high. i could tell from his eyes and that he gave off strong fumes that smelled like spray paint that made a couple of us not feel well. and he came through 3-4 times.

yeah but less than eating so i go  with that one
just do the thing that makes the thing move to you
then we are safe
viagra, aka primed continuity
nice
i’m so glad there’s no quiz on thoreau.. so i didn’t totally waste my time reading 50+ pages. that would’ve sucked
good afternoon
not even close.
i probably killed the spelling. my apologies
so i need to understand that others do the exact same thing.
amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, taking the form of a wolf.
i’m going to give you my honest opinions on whatever the subject is. that’s just me. so i hope that doesn’t interfere in future convos that we may have in the future
so isn’t amaratsu a dog or a fox?
so now that we got that squared away. are you into makoto shinkai movies?
youtube is my primary source of entertainment.
do you see it?

i hate those letters too <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i watched pokemon and that's it
oi vey
i can miss obvious jokes sometiemes.

one*
i really wanna do it
im here

ooh yay
youtube has given me yet more tools to help quantify how my channel is failing
oh so it also turns out that these new tools are somewhere between nonfunctional and hopelessly broken
ive never applied online but ive only ever applied to one job and that ended pretty poorly because i got the job

i’ll also take some pizza, thank you
benny ate it while gummy was watching him
windows wants to update and is giving me the option to do it either now or now
skarm say brb
i like integrals and pizza
very kind of you
it's basically an approximation that gets better and better and you can write it out to a greater accuracy than your calc
yay windows

tbh i never actually care about converting people to bronies just for jokes but i still converted someone
following does nothing though
i assume you meant follow
also is it bad
actually the animation is very similar to anime
talking to me is great ida
speaking of warlike and destructive, you would make a great fit for eimm
good thing i left that server when i did
i have 0 chill and i'll have you know
i usually lurk and don’t care
you just fuckin called me dan
i'm so lonely
of course we don’t always have pony talk but you get the picture
so it’s worse now
again?
my server is dead, two pony servers are too noisy
~~i just assume everyone who isn’t here at the time is out actually doing something with their lives~~
oh wait my power is back so i can toilet again

go away let me browse reddit
kick/ban
how about
i said batman and robin > the dark knight
we all do
i love how ida is instantly terrified when she join
but you probably shouldn't mod me as soon as i join or anything
im watching a stream and either the bf is being abusive or its a way of an affection
benny likes you sober
flubs!!!
um 5'7" 115 lbs

you are gross
you are a turtle
i like mozzarella
cheese is life
its okay i like cheese enough for both of us
yep i wasnt notified lul
~~=v=~~
then we roll them down a hill
i feel like i've missed a lot
as do i
you haven't missed anything, lol.  i've been biding my time, adjusting to my new job and i'm ready to kick back into the streaming world
we'll always be here for you man
but i believe they are another type of number, in 4 dimensions
i'd have to re-watch that 3blue1brown vid on em
what are the orange dots
it was this
nice, you updated these on stream too then?
love the new icon 💗
i want to do some housecleaning on this server too, but that's another day's project
and they look like i j k l or soemthing like that, i cant remember
hey guys how long has the server picture been different without me noticing
5 minutes maybe
is that the protonjon head with dragonite antennae
even if his best if fuckin trash
my guess would be homestuck or something.
no cupcake for you come to stream
victori in game
we'll go with that.
oh look streams still going on i should probably poke my head in there or something
amazo
what is ash's worst pokemon battle?
can benny be my roommate for this hotel?
my dog has bigger spots on her right side than on her left side
it's called blue steak
he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
exactly, theyre always annoying self-centered asses
kugal right click on the guy
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
thats fair
kugal tell him that this is your alt account and point him to me as your main one
i feel like with all the diversity there is on the internet, ,there's bound to be one person who says that seriously
im gonna get too depressed
and part of me doesnt want to because i still have to see him in class everyday and i dont want him to give me shit for blocking him
i need a full size version  of it to comprehend
he's been offline for a few hours, so its been pretty peaceful
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
3 day weekend for me
thats not dickish at all
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
that works too
well, int hat class anyway
oh shit that reminds me
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time
thats dumb
not the one i expected you to pin
we did it
or just relevant ones.
ok then i dont which is good
dern
would you like me to create another dab
birthday punch!
candy is secondary
good job now shes gonna kill you and call it a birthday corpse
can you reviving me faster in league though?
it's today
now waht
you should upload pubg
want to learn math?
i only upload things i can pronounce
he will get it for you
wheres the fun in that
wake him up and tell him you want wine
i create a second array of length (first array length / 2)
something something garbage collection
i just finished the second episode of telltales the walking dead’s final season and i’m bummed now
im no bandwagoner
also gummy sure we can collab, you can be the punching bag
i just got demoted from silver 4 and my first game after that i go 4/0/21 on braum
and which one
after halloween
i hate things right now *throws squid out of the pumpkin patch*
how dare you blame me?
im watching gordan ramsay cooking steak on a shovel
<:lul:305559915714576385>
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
drinking water is fun
by all means, kill gummy all you want but i'll still know, and i'd be the winner here
you are a boat
im pretty sure i can use hm03 too
but i can already use fly
tm94
let me look this up
sun and moon
sup pals
he would get to battle the fat kid
because you can never know for sure if they *arent* poisonous, but if you learn that they are you know
i've read a few *comics* about that
r i s e
the fuck is a district
its a piece of a state that has a senator
when i was a kid my next door neighbor had a different zip code and phone area code
great now i spent 12 minutes reading about nassau the island instead of finishing homework
its got all the good restaurants in the sound
master my code isnt working help
use your magic to cancel my classes too
figured i should mention today's my birthday.
greetings.
happy birthday!!
happy womb escape day
gummy i am disgusted at the implication
lets blame it on eyan
how much man card debt is he in rn?
nice
thankfully not
thermodynamics in gases?
it was way different from my high school
if i’m teaching myself why do i even go here
wonder if they could rally together in name of my sad sad grade
i want to understand things i don't understand, but then i would understand why people are dumb. but then again that's self explanatory. screw that
no you could have tell it was him
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
that includes pens, pencils, pencil lead, a notebook, some note flags, and i got 2 things that werent school related
open it
~~yeah, just ignore that last message of mine~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
and then make the boxes into a *larger* box
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
thinkinator always helps
just join him and he'll eventually stop
four little slices of salami rolled up with enough horseradish inside to make me not hungry
is it hard to use a keyboard with panda hands though
gummy if i went to bronycon i might only come out on my way to the coroner
this doesnt help it hinders at best
is that a politics joke
sorta
god what the fuck why do people always say put ice on bruises and shit
according to healthline.com, cooling the blood vessels can reduce the amount of blood that leaks into the surrounding tissue, which can prevent the bruise from being as apparent and reduce swelling.
also gummy ill be your bodyguard if i get to wear dark sunglasses and an im with stupid shirt
then how would anyone know
since i played skyrim
the law of conservation of momentum is what keeps dragonite's butt in a chair all day
you go ahead, i'm just going to save ice complaints for winter anyway
im making a sick 3d model
draco im reporting you to the humane society
i learnt yesterday ida edits better than me
yeah and also
ooh look im rainy im functional
aight then we good
hours
that sounds like an organ
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
how do you spell the word for "assure" that sounds like garrin-tiid i k ow it has a lot of unnecessary us and as and es
my mom is an emoji
alright tell me now
dragonite pick a language
bai rainy <:roocry:399827523011084298>
lemme check
outside probably closer to 3
unless 100 thieves make it out which probably not c9 is last hope
i am proffessjonal analist
yeah it’s a lot to deal with.
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i put on a vr headset once and it was like
hello
budget cuts for eample.
i just finished the little game thing and immediately had to get out
you'll keep it
people got even more confused
today i learn you don’t get 6 tattoos of the person you love and that you shouldn’t propose after one month of datig
fair enough
don’t you wanna come to the wedding?
could you wait like 20 years to move in with each other first then
its in the name though
i hate them
im surprise ida knows who that is
and they have a low level of entry but high skill ceiling
do you want to be married?
there is nothing innovative or new about it. i might as well play a less buggy, lower netcode pubg with powerups
like there's so many other things you can use that money for
maybe i should lol
and i was on a podcast with a guy who has 60k subs. not sure how many people watched it; he doesn’t get many people watching his videos anymore
vortex is dead
but dual wielded
return my vision and you can have one
but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
nobody at work knows tho
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
which im immune to
and theyre hazy as fuck even with my glasses on
i'm alive
<:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
it could potentially be c9 vs fnc in semis
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt
i didnt diss it
today was interesting
yep, that's how uni is
tbh i haven’t seen any college kid smoke
i believe in fnatic
wait i heard keyboard
i have never seen this game in my life so i don’t want to ask what it is
oh god, there’s a chance for snow a little north from here 😑
though impressive
and there’s videos on the side on his phone he’s not even watching
its not
ninja or samurai?
comic book plotline?
i saw the previews and i am very ready for it
im just...?
very slight but very much liked
5 mins before exam
the fuck is a syllabus?
im still assuming nga is roy
like super super hard
oh well fnatic is from eu
i want you to be super hard on me
you know is it bad that im still not done my essay due last monday
so, thisll be fun
you should get caught up on storyline
guys i think i hate xml.
yeah
i knew it
when does supper happen then
i think so
and flubs you would not like this person
whatever you are but in irl
"hello my name is gummy, do you like the emoji movie?"
probably not
now just gotta find an irl flubs
schools overcharge, hooray
she dies
i can get a slice of pizza at school for 2.65 but it doesnt taste very good
there’s only a couple shows where that’s ok
why would that be exciting for me lol
its a special arrangement of only the finest ~~volatile death orbs~~ vitamin rich frenchless unfrieds
i don’t want to say specifically for spoilers but oh my god
dang
well yeah. its cod. thats to be expected. shitty, but expected
you should go look at it youll be even more disappointed in me than before
what's this about my toaster
just say potatoes for gummy and theyll know
so far your friend’s not bad
it’s not good to have lol
fight my enemies yes
errr nooo
considering i don’t think you’ve had this chain before i’d be ok with that
(this is totally not based off of a stackoverflow question i saw a little while ago)
i'm right on the edge basically
i’m an east coast boi because i live here and don’t travel
that's because california is weird
burgers for dinner is good
and if i flirt with her punch me hard
how sweet
time stops love
flubs hates everything
hmm i dont feel like working on game but i dont feel like nto working on game help
ultimate power move. it shows you think less of her than she thinks of you, that you definitely saw the gift, and dont care about her gift or need the balls
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
flubs ruin my day pls
time to buy prime junk
i need like 3-4 of those
instead of saying like 6200 ft² per second i accidentally said in my head 6200 ft / s² and thought that was ok
but the littlest part of me is expecting like 13/20 or something
your dog is dead
did it feel like you knew what you were doing?
or did you feel like batman?
we're only  touching a tiny bit on integration but im like amazing at integration, so that's little worry to me
damn
flubs
since we're still in q1 here
no cussing young man
oh wait vulkar wraith is
alright i got the two most important ones
im honestly thinking about it
i do not insist
wanna hear a joke?
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
my love life
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
as a general rule if your message was successfully submitted to a server and it later disappears, the solution is not "post it again"
gummy youre officially looking for trouble and i'm hereby granting permission to interpret everything that you say as a rumination on cheese
i didnt say marry both
i don’t want it to work like that
usually, though
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
i feel like im cheating
aight
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i might be able to, but not quite right now
i can kinda see that
market
sorry
i think i still used my lato at the time
welcome
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
well from my perspective, a full time job may help since it's more consistent in terms of hours.  though i'm not certain.
i couldn’t stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
what does that mean
and you don’t have it on your switch or pager or rock
there's not only just one first seed left after quarterfinals
i fell asleep at 6 last night
at most
if they have anything cheesy prepared
afs probably knows about it
play skyrim
so basically if i do end up with this new girl she is cool that we breakup
just return it
i have become crazy
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
maybe a shiba
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
most bittersweet shit ever lmao
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
next question
im in
20 or 40?
k back
welp there goes 10k focus
rip zeal wheel: he had a short life
i can't do it to drago but i forced gummy's
asking for a friend
ida you are the best big sister a gum could have ❤
ok mr freeze
took care of dragon
i can’t give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>
fucking ask her
i will have a talk with him
:🇺 ➕ 🇲 🇪 ➡ 🍆
i forget the name of the splash one
agrewd
wanna play my games but ehhhh
can't take away a whole pc <:kappa:374346980136058893>
also i thought the same thing but guess what? you dont need to be good with computers to throw it out of a third story window
but my mom is bad w computers so i'm gokd
and
"can i pronounce its name?"
i realize something
haha time to make fun of a movie
i found 36 ds and 45 gameboy advanced/color games in a box of my old stuff
so more i go to get
can't find the account though
he's a legend
obs studio for pc. if anything else, you’re screwed <:kappa:374346980136058893>
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo
it’s the stupid booming ones too
fuck yeah
your grandma's a command prompt
are the dodgers in the playoffs or something
im not currently but now i want to know the answer
thanks im going to get a second opinion on that
okay so uh
no u
i hope it's still on da somewhere
thats probably because i reconnected him
a really big number like ten to the six
they hacking
now, i speedrun games ye?
when did it become 10
you are arent you
licorice
g2 took out rng so they're not a lightweight either
not bandwagoning
i fucking love licorice
oh yea definitely no clear winner
wtf fnatic
~~now you gotta promise to buy c9 skins if they win worlds~~
anyone can win
~~aqua is now magma.~~
whos aqua
that tells me nothing
of course they aren't bad
compared to before yeah they blow
the other had a very close series that could have gone either way.
5/6 finish in summer
i wonder how long i can avoid being social and work in game today.
long term it may be a better move
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
remember what happen to dl on clg
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
could make sense though
no reason for him to
well i think ssumday won't stay
you don't know that
i don’t have a brother
its your brother
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
i have like 3.50 on my desk in loose change that you can borrow
don't look away kugal that number will be orders more the second you check back in on it
you should probably copy and paste all those as a new e!suggest after getting that important one
i’m back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming
gonna do one more run for the night
the only thing i dont really like much about the class is how some questions we are tested on but arent explained how to do them properly
also maple syrup your username is 10/10
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
i probably didnt score as high as i usually do, but probably not as low as how my toxic mind thought i would
my profs don’t even let you see questions you missed if you didn’t get to class early enough
i just kinda wish my midterm would get graded already so i can see the horrible score i know i got
like if i dont show my work in the best way he usually wont care, as long as i came to the right conclusion and he knows its my honest work i get full credit
i havent played skyrim in like ever
i have such a bad problem with self confidence
dragonite balances out the pros and cons of this but ehh worth
but should i really?
you too
lmao microsoft is still making tts voices
so that fucking joey with 100 metapods doesnt beat you by running you dry on pp
weekly ayatan
i need to dump some cause im at 14/15 rn
the most versatile early game hm keeper in gen 4?
still no octavia
dragonite's just a dork
i use carrier
i mean yeah if i choose arceus or dialga or something i'd just look like an egomaniac
wait a minute what is that
or you stop to scan?
it yelled at me about for loops and turning x degrees already too
in practice the above is false
the colors are all weird
i should do that
and i wouldn't have met you guys
and it's been 5 minutes
12 runs
i figured it out
me or gummy or both
these are closely guarded doctoring secrets
normally yes but when it's you they're smiling at one should probably start worrying for their sanity
and smelled like perfume
is that a good thing or a bad thing
that sounds like a euphemism for something to do with the toilet doesn't it
top ten things said before disaster
but on the front page
not the first server i saw this in
i got a fiora bug fixed by getting on the front page of r/lol once
i think you’re becoming 
**normal**
now to do it with all the consonants. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
rip i'm sure they'll provide things for you if need be
i have a meeting with a prospective school but there was nothing that was said i had to prepare... so i have no idea what i need
you are my minister of war
now there is war
i forgot about that
plus it ain't exactly hard to fake degrees <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
thats confidene intervals graph type as a whole
delusional
just showing off my sprite rendered titanotylopus for zoo tycoon 1
🎉 good job aminal
personally i think im pretty great
good for you fam
like fallout 76.
squid is playing skyrim
she broke up with me
where is my sister
i am?
i kinda wanna cry
like
oh my
gummy just be like me and be single and complain about it
no it doesnt
theyre still not part of the game's files though
he has a lot of money
the smoke detector just went off and dragonite's dog.exe has stopped working
you dont hear anyone going "dear ideal masters ill trade you this dark soul gem for a spicy alchemy buff"
so did the dwarves get yote or just kinda fuck off and stop existing?
hey man dont judge the dwarves on their cooking techniques
incantations are probabaly part of summoning
depends on the topic
that is not a chaurus
it’s the first game i’m actually downloading on steam since i installed it a few days ago
well that was a failure.  neexxtt
is dragonite awake _before 10:30 for once?_
that's an uncharacteristically good idea
daniel gheesling
play skyrim for the 1,000th time
i know right
in other news the wikipedia page of "list of numbers" is pretty good too
this is non-negotiable
play it safe and ask in the morning. people interrupting your mindflow is punishable by death
think it would be safer if i asked an hour later?
the latter
not a procrastinator
best wingman ever
youtube shut up im not voting for any of them stop telling me who to vote for
bendy and the ink machine is scary game
never heard of it
help im watching horror movies tomorrow
thats got whats his name
theres only one i actually want to see
havent seen it
woah
i need to watch it first
the office is great
self control, good job
and i thought i was fast
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
i miss the office. probably going to rewatch it
my hair is too messy
pm me
for the past 3 hours
but i had to try
yeah i ate a baby
you are at the hospital
dare i ask why you are on your phone?
but it also doesnt
this si awful
why does that sound familiar
i just looked the lyrics up
mannnn i am so effing pissed with this banner leak guy and the smash community right now
but seriously batman and robin is better than the dark knight
i'm pissed btw since sakurai won't get the satisfaction of revealing these characters now because of this leaker showing off all of the remaining characters
but anyway my rant is over now
maybe
work?
if it wasnt intended
hey will
making sure you're the right guy here btw, is that you flubs?
just move duh
other people don't want to be spoiled!
actually kinda
the wifi isn't out
wasn't even working on the wired computer
i think wired is as close as you can get
hello kugals
no it was my old flipphone
big enough where i don't fuck up and press another button
i hate phone typing
i only used it for 2 things
i hate touchpads...
well its sketchy as shit
i uninstalled skype
but who gives a fuck its easy to use
i sort of understand that, my hands were really shaking after playing on my ps3 for a while
i must know these laws
oh that
i have to actually look at what i'm typing if i have to use a touchpad
it isnt even about cold i just have a weird feeling in my hands and wish for it to not be so annoying. if i wear gloves i dont have to put as much pressure on my fingertips
yea he said he had tog o
i remember that
the what now
im great at saving money gum
calling the bathroom "the little boy's room"
<:roocomfy:399827521253670912>
good point
especially if you still interact witht he person after the fact
i can't spell
make peace
alright lol
tell me what he said so i can say it too
but i figured out what the joke was gonna be
i didn't knock anything off my to-do list today and i just want to go play skyrim instead
some time in the mines should straighten you out
the forsworn are nice they have cookies and only try to kill you on some days
did someone steal his sweetroll?
good job gum
because it's like
that is not a skill in skyrim why would you have a 100 on it
kugal be quiet you're like fourteen
idk how females work
i am depressed
hey sis wanna move in with me for a day?
understandable
oh - dah - ving
that’s how i was until 2016
no stick pls
that did not age well.
what was the snapchat of
last time it was scary
hop to
thats going in the sub
flubs
me me me!
but the game still allots time for it so it makes some of the animations kinda weird
night at 5 am
that was four and a half hours ago now
guess whose monitor broke the night she needs it
gummy don't break ida's monitor
im in bed before my sis
i’m just lazy and did an all in one kind of character
congratulations gummy you act at least ten years younger than you are
my classes hardly have gotten cancelled this semester and i don’t approve
(also if a spider makes it next to me i just turn to face the wall and accept my death)
blitzypoo is next in line
i don't know dating
thats the best
first that gives you time to see if you actually like them
set her on fire then she'll be hot
or are we talking about ida
the females only have bad luck though because you keep trying to talk to them
pfft
kugal he said _smart_
no drago
i keep asking gummy but he keeps changing the subject for some odd reason
yeah i'm surprised there's that many too
interesting
<:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
either or
panda's here who wants to talk about butts
i'm not either but it makes my inner seven-year-old giggle
amen to that one
see ya drago
night drago
set who up with me now
i can hook drago up with a girl
she is 19
how old is she
also did i say i was going to sleep? i lied i got distracted by reddit
what other girl gum
i mean i did the age test
but jesus that reminds me im gonna be 17 in like a couple of months
i think she deserves someone ten times better than me
i wouldn't exactly call it a test.
why are you trying to set me up with people in the server lmao
you and her go out
im gonna invent it for the lonely and desperate though
because idk any other females
everyone wins
of course it isnt
my parents want the opposite
why is he asking me about shit thats past due
does that help
plot twist i never slept
~~sleep is for the weak and squid~~
is the twitter-removing-the-like-button thing real or did i forget to wake up this morning
good job?
so anyway, i drove a half hour to class, only to find out that class was cancelled
why didnt dragonite see said email?
that’s not the reason you should have to dislike this happening...
guess who got an email saying that class was cancelled!
either my teacher's email account is magically broken and it's the only one because i"m still getting every single other piece of spam that the school sends out to every single student, or my teacher didn't send an email
oops didn't see you there
i recorded stuff earlier. need to edit it sometime
needs more letterboxing
i should probably record something
my desk drawer is jammed shut and that's where i keep my wii remotes
go back to bed
#getidaoutside
maybe revise that sentence
shit i needed ida since idk how to food shop

nick valentine has the same voice actor as belethor and a bunch of other minor skyrim characters

okay, so where you do want me to put this lighter fluid at?
it breathes a certain air of positivity i think the world could really use
honestly i think a lot of people would stay in the server if they were greeted by a bot calling them a fuckwad and saying he was gonna murder them
anyway, i can chill and sleep finally
its so very fair and balanced that he gets a free soul charge
so basically the whole ordeal
you should do a histiry essay on tbe history of history essays
his excuse was that he has bipolar disorder
anyway i really should do the whole sleep thing bye
im curious now
good luck gum
i have uploaded all of my 2014-2015 super mario 3d land videos

i was not informed of this
let’s collab and do a super mario bros 3 speedrun
but they have tacos and burritos
i should have said chipotle
i always want to try chick-fil-a
and walmart in the frozen food aisle

the best thing ever
which makes you eligible for a parking ticket
like some people do

mom wants me to abuse, i mean trim the hedges, gummy ill get back to annoying you later
i’m craving a coffee. what’s happened to me
despite someone gifting it to me
your body wants you to get coffee ice cream instead 😉
maybe it’s the fact that i have a lot to do in the next 48 hours and all i want to do is nap 🤔
and then there's stuff like the halting problem and the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics
“no drugs as well pls”
i don’t, so i don’t know why i want one
also take everythign i say with a grain of salt, im just angry, i dont mean anything i say
sorry that’s happening, blitz
just to give ya an idea
im doing it, i cant let today happen again
maximum full melee flow mode
or that you can’t be accessed by them, so they’d know it anyway
the focus is all just from running eidolon hunts
good choice kugal
i may regret the lack of energy
lmao then youd watch it if you really wanted to
who said what to me?
and tease gummy
where are my dating advisors?
no flubs and not robot
cool thanks
good luck bella
good luck
im not too fond of halloween
ironically last year my place got 0 trick or treaters
only worse thing is apple slices <:kappa:374346980136058893>
lies
people are pretty adamant about getting their candy
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
well that was tragic
f indeed
shit i would be older than my big sis
it's ok, there's always next time
im asking her out thursday
im kinda curious to see what she'll say lol
what
okay thanks but
that is not a pick up line
we live like the 18th century
that is not normal
perfect
enjoy
jeesh its almost 4, where did time go
she did a lot today in a teasing way
sooo if i date her
why would i have it?
does everyone use pick up lines on you or what?
i dont think thats how it works bud
i went out of a bathroom
also probably why i don’t like them
cause thats the most common answer
and i don't want to spend money on drops after noticing that recovery time was faster when i didn't use them
dare i ask what his response was?
boy were they wrong!
interesting
with spongebob
i can’t get my head around it
i tried playing morrowind once but if you do that on anything newer than windows xp it becomes a walking catastrophe that i can't be arsed to fix
nobody asked you cortana
sounds fun. might be able to later
ehh just use wine
flubs roll and talk to me
pls use code word
but the c did not accept the peace treaty
caught up on last week's flash for the episode tonight
id hope so
they had a strange start schedule but its evened out
i guess they didnt make any in the years i played nintendo games
i dont think i played anything on the gamecube
when is paper skyrim coming out
don't joke about tragedy rc
when elder scrolls 6 is cancelled, dragonite
i was busy
why has no one used pick up lines on me?
i would write a very angry letter to todd howard's mother
we're fucked
places arent open
amazon is 24/7

<:doit:334014889137930240>
i found someone im smarter than
oh wait the ghost weapons have lighter weights than normal weapons so they might have a faster swing rate
sot has more content, which is saying something

a majority of my diet is frozen food and cold cut sandwiches
gummy i can break that thing gimme it
that's 24 hours from now
that doesn't seem right to me
i’m celebrating by doing nothing
guys
howd you get that funky n

ahhh
ida aren't you taller than most people
i’m 5’8”
i hate you
i'm popeye the sailor man, i'm popeye the sailor man! i'm strong to the finish 'cause i eat me spinach, i'm popeye the sailor man!
she’s basically a vegetarian
xenoblade it is
i have an opportunity to record xenoblade today, the question is, can i be bothered to turn my wii u on
shouldve replied "because your mom told me"
i think i did
i prefer pid personally
i should probably go to class soon
lmao
wait you have your normal icon how did you do that?
hmmm
lmao even wolfy doesn't like "to-mah-to"
he probably swapped back after that screencap was taken.
you guys ever get the feeling that the best way to find points for your argument is the flaws of the antithesis?
so thats $60 an hour for private security and $2600 for the flight and hotel
better than canadian weather
i will pay for her food though
i have to do a paper... but its also halloween.
thats why
its already christmas season
unless dragonite feels like staying up till 2 as usual
tcp stands for "the candy protocol" right
ftp is for like lettuce and cabbage and stuff though there really should be a separate protocol for the important stuff
perfect
uhhh
do tomorrow's physics tonight?
nice nice
i do get made fun of too if i slightly grow it out
my physics teacher anyway
academic or professional?
perfect <:lul:305559915714576385>
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i hate halloween
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
halloween is dumb people dont even look like scary
oh they definitely are
or take matters into your own hands
i think halloween is moreso a fashion show now
im a kaiser
~~a kaiser roll?~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
hey man i profit regardless
hia gummy
aww...
awww whyd i do that
remember to not overthink it gummy, just ask "do you want to go out with me"
gummy, are you trying to get no one to date you?
at the store, from your sink, in a river
you record your office?
that's not what i was going for
gummy shut
like so many times i wish micheal would bully her hard
ryan is one of my favs
he only gets more creed-like. its great
i do enjoy some of gabe's scenes when he's not going crazy for erin
the office
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
but i love ryan
jim's probably still my favorite out of all the major characters
depending on context, especially the dwight one
i was confused
gummy, you're definitely more dwight than jim
im here doing hw in the dark
and its not fun
because spoopy memes
pffft haha
im gonna do that next time
if gummy wants to ask her out he must impress her
not on netflix
i feel deja vu coming along
so she only eats birds, maybe deer
of course he went corrupted
where do i take a girl who only eats veggies and chicken out?
jeez that box office is a lot
the office
i.e. how much your purity score drops
since beef
that doesn't mean you can do my drugs
there is a 25% chance she will say no
works for me a little too well
watch her on the bus if she says yes
also that ^
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
he is lonely
my friend sent me this emoji 😑
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
well yeah
but you're still a tad young for that lol
the odds are low
panda, let's go get coffee
the name is quite fitting in this situation
weird, i can do that soon
gummy yeas
i think usually do almond milk
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
i'd say mine costs me
though she does have a scimitar which is less straight than her
well, mostly fittings and horseshoes
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
minié rifle
or like straight as an arrow
let me repeat that
post malone? <:roothink:399827523581771796>
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
gummy likes to segregate in his mind
and that i should stick to history
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
besides you can't hurt me rainy
i am a hair person
i got acne on my forehead as well
.....
my own sister against gum
blake isn't fuckin jacked
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
me neither (sorta)
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
raven, sorta kinda
because eventually you cross a line and you go back to us and ask what you did wrong.
those are the best girls
when it was quite obvious.
my grave!
i think i’ve only seen an episode of scrubs
partly
is this true?
it doesn't make it clear that that's her own grave
alright, everyone come over to my place, and we shall watch it and have the time of our lives
sleep over?
well ida knows me well how i always somehow i accidentally do it
on purpose
i prefer a slumber party
i told her she is the best
fuck twitter just brokoro my kokoro
bam roasted
i just said she has more than you.
it’s like what me and drago so
it’s fake
what's this sleep you speak of?
i wouldn’t know what to order. i should try that out
of what the literal differences were
so what's the other option bella?
if you like white chocolate go with that
oh look it's three in the morning how'd that happen bye
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
good enough for me, thanks guys
smash just gets way too much hype and attention
real men play mario kart
mario kart 9 is happening?
probably when the tenth gen consoles come out
next week boys next week....
well gives me a few days to work out what i wanna say to her
okay well i blame flubs
in the northern hemisphere
because i left cookies and milk for santa once
i need your advice squid
flubs.
wonderful, thank you
him too
apparently not.
i was actually surprised they're going all out on dlc
a character from xenoblade if i'm not mistaken
that certain emperor is me
oh flubs she got sick tomorrow
how do you know that
and i can’t say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
alright
no problem
but yeah, rex got relegated to being a fucking costume
ah, purpleeyes
hmm?
lab was so empty today
that was because i didnt have enough material though
but it still has my boys
yeah, i guess that’s a point
but thats just because nerves
flubs
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
there you go
in fact i appreciate it
i agree with flubs
who is you know who
i mean theres no reason a girl shouldnt ask out a guy
worth it if it works
its only two late when one or both people are dead
but fell in college love
alright but fear of rejection flubs
here gummy ill quiz you and see if youre an incel. how would you refer to a girl who dumped you to your friends?
i got a lot of things happen to me during my love life
just have no self esteem
so i would say they were sweet?
i wouldn’t care unless they were still dating someone
since they were still my friend
gummy you're supposed to learn that in junior high
they started that in 5th grade for us
what else?
elementary was 0-6 here for reference
ok but you understand that her being in a previous relationship changes nothing right
depends who i don’t like
not an a hole
which is a lot of people
there arent really more though
i just got home what's gummy doing now
in my life time
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
and upset
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
you mean my little one or ida?
so i don't know what i would do if i wanted to settle down
yet you were in the hospital waiting for her
ahaha no
and i cannot stay stable
you take my little sister
the book says go somewhere fun
i need someone to help me grocery shop
i'll buy wine
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
1 cent
okay...
if youre asking them out invite them over
why is the library a choice?
history all the way
anytime xd
god i hate november
no offence ida i know you would
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
wtf a farmer market...that is worse than a library
that is benny's date
farmers market it is
so i would have to pick
fair rule is whoever asked imo
probably helps not to limit it to one place
okay does the girl pay for dinner or is it the guy?
not mine
or what bella said
there is this good ice cream place...
where we wanna go
true
tuesday no matter what
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
is there a stream right now?
told her over snapchat because she pressure me to say it because i told her i had something to tell her
yes you can
i got rejected
gummy i'm so proud of you :')
but can i ask when will king of zeal/superskarmory will be back recording for youtube again?
yay?
i doubt even _he_ knows honestly
i am a disappointment to myself
like why do you care, lol
still brokem
that kid who i blocked, his brother confronted me about it in the middle of class
fighting him is better
also i wanted decidueye instead of incineorar, but i'm good already with the roster
>that sad moment when you realize you have a stronger connection with piranha plant with the games you've played over the characters in the fake banner/grinch leak since you haven't played those characters games
skyrim
my teacher say the conversation and sent probably one of the sweetest emails i've ever received
<:lul:305559915714576385>
well i wish i saw that edit sooner
like i said to that certain person i saw, he could always be dlc
smash 4's dlc had 4 newcomers
"we got to have.... *moneyyyyyy*"
the german empire anthem is amazing
i'm not sure on how many stages we got with smash 4's dlc btw
and they were called duck hunt duo in europe
bummer we didn't get smash run though, but oh well
of course you'd listen to that
hopefully there's not going to be another stupid great maze again
i loved playing as them
the "not-so-great" maze.
and then it turns into who cares about a boyfriend when you can get an a in calculus
how many square tomatoes is it if each tomato is 3
yes its more chill than secunda, dragonite
i have my character predictions ready for the dlc
i am a kaiser
yeah i expected as much
which is better than platforming imo
still gunning for elma and joker, though i have my doubts.
i see you are making use of that right today
it probably wasn't important right
nah, just felt like saying it
this isn't in any order btw
for the record i didn't invent you rang i got it from foxtrot who got it from the addams family
who probably got it from somewhere else
you said yeet like 6 years before it became common
i could have invaded canada with all of my stupid high school videos
oh you know what it's private
i guess if you have steam 2fa enabled you should grab your phone too but only if you own skyrim
how did i miss that
gren'ich gren'ich gren'ich ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
gummy just tell him it's dragonite's fault he'll probably believe you
cant get demonetized if you dont make any money in the first place
and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold lies and the gold he had made
also i played x in italian once even though i can only read like ten words of italian and was fine so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
so greenland is on white witch time
gummy how do you say "over your dead body" in russian
i actually dont really like the smb3 overworld
other n64 games aged decently, sm64 was not one of them
the 90s were a mistake
good maybe i should not give a shit more often
destiny 2 is supposedly free until nov 18 but i cant find where tf the free version is downloadable
hey master youre a hardware guy right?
anyways, i have nothing to do until stephen’s extra life stream starts in around 3 hours
and i tend to call myself a cat so that makes me a furry
oh there once was a hero named magus the red who came riding to whiterun from old rorikstead

and it actually takes months unless you pay money
so many options
it's painful
majora's mask is like the hardest game ever
see if the achievements were no hit a boss or complete the game at sl1 thatd be fun
im at 0%
you know what better than that
it was trash in gen 3
always been trying to catch that one in animal crossing
poor paris
i hate eating recently
dread it
like i just dont enjoy the action of eating
im also wondering this
run from it
peggy still arives
runs at the speed of fucking sound into a brick wall and smashes her head into the ground
are they nice?
as much as i would love to see everything go down, i have work tomorrow afternoon
good night ^^
why peggy why??
she can outrun the smashening
aint nobody cooler than this dan
be a shut in neet who hasnt seen the sun in two years
it hurts
yeet
amazing island is *already* back in fifth
sup pham, i just got a switch, so if u got one and wanna add me, here’s my friend code.
sucks for you when daylight comes back in the soring
today i had to get up by 6:30
amazing spiderman2
i wake up at 6 for work. makes me feel like i have a productive day
12 is what i find early
well getting up at 5 means i get to work at 6, which means i stop work at 2 and get home at 3. so i have my whole day open
i woke up at 9 today and really wasn’t into it
sleeping doesnt make me less tired
you get used to it.
1 am
maybe ida
hey bunni msg me perfect
interesting
i spent 1 hours before i fell asleep watching musket videos
im gonna do it beb
he lives!
i do indeed
i dunno wat to use
use the one that doesnt sear your eyes
because christmas
there are several sections of the year:
magfest week
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823> lonely months
hot and lonely months
because it's christmas soon™
i still dont know *what* magfest is
lets all go to magfest
it's also a secret excuse to eat hamburgers all weekend because all of the other food in the area is either expensive or trash but dont tell my mom i said that
only convention i know what i want to go to
when going to nyc we do usually stop at albany overnight to visit friends tho
you should probably do that too
he has hair like you
perfect drago
radioactive is close enough
its directly across the sound from me and they have cheap crab and cheap alcohol
i give you my presence
drink alone in sadness and cryu
ct is basically a highway with a toilet stop right
playing around with my joke youtube channel
time to join fullscreen
it's like 1974
wing together a perfectly calculated setup
freedom it is
i think you're a bit too concerned about the layout but if it makes you happy and gives ya something to do, go for it
the overlay for oras looks nice
wait stream is on now?
guess i'm going to hell (the piece is called the gates of hell btw) lol xd
out with family
demand your money back
what else would be on the do something useful category?
hmm eyan's streaming
lol xd
i think it took like 180 hours the last time i did it
i figure once i 100% it i'll get sick of it and not play it again for another two weeks right
or just not do them
twitch is broken for me
that sounds even worse
but i like free experience and money
go drive into a pillar
these are quite obviously shrute bucks
you're allowed to run around it if you can't kill it somehow
that's what work wants you to think
drive into pillars, is a good insult
one on the broken ds one on the not broken ds
i need a script writer
stephen is great tho
"let me make my *entire fucking life* public
see, peggy.
all vloggers are uninteresting.
understandable
dont google that
he’s just professional
im still kinda shock ida edits better than me
well i need a script writer
also writing is hard \
that explains a lot tbh
but what if youre a poketuber
that concerns me slightly less than mr. joe on street street knowing everything about my daily life
flubs, you need to react to more than just the c
c is the only letter that's actually a base though
was a very interesting car ride.
shes laying on my leggs
my mom's boyfriend put on a ben shapiro debate today
how many years will that take
they're waffling about somewhere, i'm sure.
ice on the sidewalk
dragonite
it was on their property
but were you actually paying attention
i dont have his phone number
brb class
i wonder if they can sue you for wasting their time
well i need a lawyer and my sis is the only one that knows how to do this law thing from those ace games she played
how dare she say that
you tripped over a mouse?
she likes making fun of me
it made a really loud nosie
do you want a wall of 3's, flubs?
thanks
i have it
well yes. but sometimes we don't like fractions and prefer decimals
hex superior
but with the question of dec100/dec3
the chicken looks like i ran it over with a cement mixer

specifically right over gummys house
it's a dital image compressed using a discrete cosine transform
tried sending a picture with a message, but it didn’t go through
tomorrow i meet up with the girl who rejected me
i kinda wanna hear the story behind that
well done!
there
also its not loadi g for me
~~you~~
hmmm
wouldn't they also show your face on the news?
i regret going down this road
hahaha
what does that page say?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
"don't fucking try me"
and i believe i still have the exact same score as a year ago. this is what happens when you never get a relationship
maybe i should find jesus
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh wow
i'm smelling some serious heresy
but the islands disappearing bit
not the "no one noticing for 30+ years" but
also i used a random follower for the boethiah quest and now i feel terrible
i had a 70 something on this last time i check
they're your friends
history?
second on the list is annoy drago
the disadvantage of a morning class: i really want to get the thing we need to do today done already
like sit there and do nothing
also the more i talk to my uni friend
im lonely
flubs find a female version of you pls
that guy
well flubs
oh i know that one guy from pirates of the caribbean
comadore
thats on them
i don't do that unless asked
thank you person who said that
come on ida i give you attention all the time and you don't seem to like it
lmao
regal said it
according to vikings they don't say that
so it's even
a hug is the most anyone gets from me
i only hug people i like
you'll learn to enjoy it
oh well for if it's nothing to do with a monarch then eh
i been too busy with gummyland
congrats
only if you take them according to prescription
just did my good ol civic duty
i sold my civic duty for drugs
oof i wanna lean to bros 3
someone should collab with me
gummy what would you even do if you managed to do that
i know
not do oot: master quest blind, probably
okay, because 100%ing mm is not as bad people say it is, and you're also on the remake and not the original
im with a bunch of nerds playing a card game
because video game movies are famous for being well-made and successful
and then give it all to me because it was my idea
i dont see it
i'm supposed to be doing homework
same to an extent
do you play nerdy board games?
how on earth are they like me then
ahh bob ross
wait how can the big man move
i gotta wait 20 minutes for the bus
anyone here?
gummy read fedpaper 10
im so cold right now
it's mind numbing
fiddlesticks
well
....
first thing in mind that i think when math is said is calculus
is that my cue to spend the next four hours writing code for things other than classwork or
is there any actual use for a function whose order is 29
but that method is gold
i forget what the other name for the biggest exponent is
antiderivatives are pretty neat
python is heavy on indentation for formatting, java is heavy on brackets
what’s wrong with breakfast
okay the last time i ate breakfast voyager 2 had officially left the solar system, but only just barely
our calc teacher just sent this
the "getting up before 10:30" part
things it doesnt do right: 68,7634,541
things it does right: 1
although node probably lets you do it
maybe 4th
i mean javascript wasnt really designed for taking console input
yeet
we all die eventually gummy
i wonder if i can launch both the special edition and the regular edition
i.e. dragonite
earth prolly
it is bad
im a kaiser
also i taught my dad how to use discord
flubs we should hang out sometime

and had to close my eyes for the rest of the movie
im still grossed out by that movie
welcome!
<:lul:305559915714576385>
hi person
after that it's less fun
i have a heart with someone on snapchat
same for me!
ironic that it's with breana
im actually not fully in charge of editing thank god
it's the sound that my fist makes when it collides with the top of his head
and somehow he likes me
most shit post admin would be...yeah prob master
ida don't encourage him
that violence was meant to be for irony tbh
you don't remember when we first met
i don't..
you weren't as annoying
i do
changed*
no you're not
yep!
to be honest
sorry ida but i can't take orders well or do something i don't wanna do
she means me
i would have destroyed everything
i like war but usually when i am here i think about it more
someone lemme know if thats too harsh, i'm legit not sure
this server is not nearly as mentally taxing as some others i'm on
which leads me to think about war the most when i am here...
great now i just know my mind is as bad as eyans thanks
gummy you weren't enemies both of you were just dumb
no drago
right gummy?
and i thought ida was actually gonna end up like one of them because when eyan's server started she just went super mean to me
not here, apparently
i feel like i missed a lot in the few months i was gone
we are good friends now
and one of them threatens to punch me
im too rough now
ida i need protection
you were here yesterday though
but i feel a lot tougher now
can confirm because school is stupid
the war of 1812 is a war that was started in 1812
who has heard of the war of 1812?
werent there two of them
cheers
i am suing my school
even the rejection ones
what
we are gonna do that
that will piss off two people i know for sure
just remember you got your whole life ahead of you
thank god since i hate kisd
let em come to you
we've talked about this before
can't have friends knowing
unrelated but how much do prime time ads on national tv cost?
has nintendo given up on qa or something
theres some things i want to catch in the pokéwalker but it requires me to get a lot of exercise and i dont feel like walking the dog or going a bunch of circles in the kitchen
for once i thought about it
nest
so nekopara is on switch now
i'm leafleaf
<a:atpc_jumpcited:485160985028460546>
i don't remember but it might be
change your nickname then
this let's play stuff i will only work on
i say 3 more let's plays!
thank you.
what about civ?
hey ida when are we gonna hang out again?
not the first game
i have castle crashers
i gotta get through that
you can play multi player in portal?
hey, wanna watch lion king 2?
the first chapter of it is free gummy
hey heard about that new undertale prequel game?
okay
and flubs
sorry
didn't know who it was so i rejected the request
but back then it was absolute horseshit and no one wanted to pay $60 + a monthly subscription for a shittier version of wow
jeez how many ffs are there now
back when it first launched
wowee
the world thing on steam
and probalby even more that ive never heard of
two handed or some sorta conjurer is what im leaning toward rn
usually just end up getting 50 in one handed and giving up and go full warrior
ended up fisting alduin to death since i was a khajiit
because i'm terrified
still the same thing in oblivion
hmmmmm
but you could conjure armor along with that
actually you know what
i have 108 as my iq
why were there germans in hong kong
i’m very curious to know why some guy has a cut out of what i think is ash’s hat strapped onto his forehead
i dont like playing as an archer
lab mates and i today picked up beans with different items in the name of science.
and it was worse than that
also did anyone hear about defy media shutting down?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
tortillas have been eaten sleep now
i haven't had cereal in years though
i guess i could just pet my dog until i have to go
don't
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
95% chance
hi person
~~screw family~~
guys.
you rang
i'm not responsible for hurricanes, power outages, comcast, and acts of god
should i play skyrim
the two protagonists havent interacted too much up to that point
i have downloaded a dating app
that is fair
this is too hard
active?
like me at the park or somewhere
like what i enjoy and stuff
i had a really good analogy for if you meant active like exercise
i can see how outdoor pictures would be more appealing to people
would have love to see how that would turn out
mapquest is not a dating app
but i have a rarity beach pic when i pretend to be rarity
shes been dead for like a billion years so yeah the new old people who live there would probably be confused
you set it on fire
two in the morning is nothing
thanks i've been up for 3 days
you know this sibling role play thing is so fun
wanna hang in vc and help me with my dating profile flubs?
flubs i'm looking for work as a professional dog petter, are you hiring?
i could pet your dog for you while you're away doing redacted
sorry fam im employed fulltime doing redacted right now
and own a casino
hi dead i’m squid
“i’m not tomboyish, i’m just boyish” - flubs 2018
there is a moth flying around my room and i hate it
it's 10:38 and i havent gotten anything done yet tonight
high
it's what i'm about to listen to
hi i'm fucking done, i'm--oh screw this
hi didnt fucking say im, i'm dragonite
it got too quiet after flubs stormed out
uh huh...
but even if he did you'd probably still do it
he did
hey it's not
im about to do the craziest thing ever
doesn't matter
we only broke up 6 times
<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
brought to you by ms paint (tm)
lets do a pro and cons chart
imma do it
wait depends
did it involve beans
panda might know
a friend for life 
this is one of the rare times i use the mlp way
my way is better
10 minutes?
my biggest issue is the amount of services they expect you to subscribe to in order to be able to have a wide selection of newly airing shows
i hate how crunchyroll holds episodes for 1 week before the non paying people can get it
thats not much of a concern to me
guys
greetings and salutations, dan! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!
my fave flavour is salt and pepper wings
flubs i did something stupid after you left
drugs?
i mean uh welcome
what the events that happen? how are they hazing? its an artillery strike
someone doesnt understand how fast explosions are
also is there a stream tonight or something? i've been mia recently
also i had a dream that i was sneak attacking draugr in skyrim
that was a fun dream
thanks flubs
also believe in your king
there we go
welcome
just be like me and make all your videos terrible <:kappa:374346980136058893>
yes?
how do i do the tm thing?
but i had a sibling bonding week
that was kinda funny
it is right now
its the cheapest option so its what i use
still one of the best anivia players out there
but it's _almost as if the author has never installed an mmo before!_
obviously he started streaming twenty minutes ago but didn't realize that his internet isn't plugged in
it wasn't my best game
but you didn't let him get ahead
except you need to actually do something in mario kart to win
you don't have to pay me i just want to pet dogs
or do you?
omg looking at the old msgs i was way more energetic back then
you can play the game with no button inputs, that's just how you go in 12th
holy shit i was not like what i was last year
not that tm
who even knows
someone tell daylights savings to stop so i don’t want to sleep at 5 k thanks
like before daylight savings id feel like i was gonna get axe murdered on my way to work but now i dont
dark at 5? weak
hey ida hows the arctic circle the week before christmas?
i wanted to do something similar in wearing a costume the day after halloween
will do
dark
you can't threaten me
hey everyone is with gummy
tell her that dragonite is cheering for her
"my father left our family for another woman"
correct dragonite
because of what i suffer two years ago
unsurprising
so i am angry to this day over it
flubs wireless or wired?
or i will, soon
i have ice cream
i just beat him like 4 times in a row, and he wasnt able to play online before today, and i fucking destroyed him, and the combo i use stunlocks people if they leave an opening and also i kept taunting them
406 open squads in orb vallis
agreed
oh also i failed the mission
it was online

go ahead flubs
you know what's a really good keyboard?
quiet keyboards are nice
also you know what's annoying
i like him already
stan lee is dead.....
his daughter confirmed he is dead
i really want to play rdr2
im sure he would appreciate that sentiment
otto was cooler than lincoln
thatd be like if people stopped fighting during a war for a day and then started fighting again
today i learn you can make ice
depends on how much time passes then
see my champ pool is l o r g e
oh god, we’re probably going to get 3-5 inches of snow tomorrow
and it does work fine for a lot of people and it doesnt work at all for a lot of other people
history lecture pls
im listening to music on it just fine
i can make a math/history vid
gummy why are you in my oven
thats sucky rc
dont rush yourself kugal
as long as most of them are in the same language your teacher will just read too much into it and give you an a
bam assignment done
1. 4 eggs
2. enough flour
i'll get back to you in a few days
listen, after i more or less dropped off on harvest december after how absurdly long the august arc was, i think i'm at least going to try to get caught up with something that is not 'dragonite tries to read on camera'
i just grew to the point where i stopped caring about the visual novel in general
no my computer mouse is falling apart
prob was too rough on it
that sounds like peripheral abuse
what, did samsung make that mouse? /s
fancy that
oh my mouse is an hp
yes samsung made it
is stream potato or is it on me
will the livestream be live until 11’ish?
i think it may have been head icons, specifically the homestuck one
im not drunk im flubs
see the problem is youre using it for the taste and not the not thinking
i’ll take the silence as a yes
okay, ,the show more input i guess broke
that brings you to a grand total of 55,682 years in jail or cleaning the toilets in the zeal palace until the end of eternity
good to know it's still functional i gu—never mind
gummy i think skarm is mocking you
what’s eyan streaming? xcom again?
yeah
no he is not
yeah youre definitely up late
i managed to bs my way through most of it in 90 mins
that sounds like vampirism but worse
excuse me sir is this your torch
vampirism is great though
are you surprised
but yet you want me?
i am suspicious
also i wanna write code
the amount of dog pets that must happen per second is greater than the amount of seconds that happen per second
so someone tell me why my computer mouse is half beaten to death?
sooo yeah
never give them back to me ever again
then when i got back with her anger happen again
wait
i need that medicine
like?
dont say that to her please
just because you arent stupid enough to do it doesnt mean you wont do it
im trying my best to assist
and yet im kinda down for the similar reason but for me it’s more of
i won’t ida
it wont cure the lonely but its a damn good distraction
always wanted to experience a life of a soldier in the 18th century
that sounds like his problem
go to razer
top ten smartest human beings who broke the system
im german!!!
says the canadian
we get snow
montauk and the hamptons
people are always angry there
not including western fire island because western fire island is the tits
i had fun there
you hate a lot of places
weird right
but you seem to enjoy life
he hates enjoying things
now i don’t
tbh most of the reason i dont stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing is because id be justified to and people wouldnt really be surprised
though flubs happens to not get under my skin at all...
platinum
i like dogs
cats aren’t that bad as i originally thought
cats are kinda like me
like i only dont at this point because i didnt before
here:
im going to the hair salon
actually looks great...
thanks i made it myself i promise
get a mohawk
i know, but that just gives me a few basic ideas
oh no
ida wanna cut my hair?
we've proved that √2 is irrational, we've proved that the number goes on forever, isnt that cool?
you'd think that would be impossible
and thats what makes it so not absurd
hey flubs did you know there's the quadratic equation...and the cubic equation? for cubic functions, functions like x³ and not x²
thats the cubic equation
well, math isn't simple because life isnt simple
thats why nobody likes science either
i like science and math though! d:
which is why youre frigging weird
idk maybe the higher level shit is cool but i never did any of that
ok mr 100%
if anythign it sucks really bad for the lazy kids who arent motivated and dont want to learn what they want you to learn
if they dont get high state test scores then some bad shit happens to the shcool or whatever
but when youre taught that shit in fucking 2nd grade art
so i think thats one thing schools emphasized for soem reason
i needed it for my math classes here.
knowing how to do basic multiplication and the primary colors doesn't exactly make you look smart
and regardless of your actual intelligence
i was one of those until i wasnt
i don't talk much in class anymore, not because i dont wanna be made fun of, i've just become more quiet. but last year i wasnt as quiet and i get a lot of passive aggressive speech directed towards me lol
you're just gonna buy new ones aren't you
9th grade i took algebra, 10th grade i took geometry and algebra 2
oh someone just told me algebra 2 is just the new name for trig
but now it's like the complete opposite
algebra 2 had *some* trig for me
im currently in intro to stat and calc 1
wacky
done with my phone call
dinosaurs are fucking awesome
not for me though 😦
here ill teach you about dinos instead
so somehow i am talking in a breath of the wild server
theyre fuckin awesome
then fuck em
bully them back
make them feel useless
bully them back
do it!
im just not gonna acknowledge the guy again
why is it not alive
i’m back from work ya ninnies
guys i spent the evening out of my coffin playing ping pong with dad and it somehow wasn't awful
is having a good time with your father a bad thing?
no that's not the problem the problem was that i was out of my coffin
i could win a world record for how stupidly redundant i can be
draco go watch grass grow or something
go back to your coffin, dammit
i was just about to go sleep actually.
did someone say steak
all sorts of cookies
excuse you all cookies are created equal
butter on cookies?
no theyre like so vanilla that they dont even contain vanilla
also i have 2+ hours of the last two worlds of smb1 to edit
why do i have to suck at this game so badly
i used to like christmas music
i like it
why do elevator button pushers exist
ahh yes i see someone has discovered the pitch shift button
thats a tough one drago
this is torture
speaking of the upside-down
yes they have animals with names like kangaroo and wallaby and blue-ringed octopus
no its bob ross
the answer is yes
google was actually really disappointing
fuck
kugal stop being good at things how dare you
ew facebook
fixed the brother blitz
its comparing two stories and how rhetorical devices were used to advanced and add power to the persuasiveness to each piece of writing
i wrote a poem about hating poetry once
im getting flash backs to poems some girls in my highschool wrote
like they'd have me read soem of their long ass poems on the spot and i'd have to pretend like its the best thing ever written or else i'd hurt their feelings
i remember one day in like 9th grade? i sat on the couch and just got caught up on my english work. i got caught up, but not before doing 5+ hours of poetry quizzes and tests and readings and ***uggggggh***
poetry for fun is really pleasant
this "3d rendering system" thing is haaaaaaaaaard
"shut up my sentret needs the exercise"
pokemon go is great
probably
not anymore
i also considered microwave oven and motorized can opener
right skarm?
85 watts
my calc 1 midterm was stressful enough lol
that’s embarrassing
and then it ends and you are even sadder because it’s over
human with a side of aged honey mustard
i fixed my mouse btw
i guess that works
i broke it with a hammer and fixed it with a hammer
watts aren't a lot
is 70 kg a lot and is 20 m/s a lot
155 pounds is a lot tho
maybe i should just take it up to the roof of the english building and drop it
not with that attitude
imma become an artist
bugger off mee
> is already signed into google drive
found this while organising shit
it's my weekend, i ate half a pizza for breakfast, i hate my life
nahhh
i mean, it's not like me challenging gummy is much of a fight
here
i held!
t=+15 minutes and teacher is swearing at git, as usual
oh, eyan’s streaming
hey ida civ 6 next?
if i have it i guess
but i held on
i really should probably go home but the other people are being so weird it's hard to resist wasting time to see what airhead things they do next
both
climate change sure is good aint it
and not july
at this rate i'm conviced fall just completely disappeared. so now there are only two seasons
i don’t want sala
what is a noitarepo
i thought it was operation noitarepo
gummy go be dead
can’t i just create a goddamn palindrome
but then you would need shirts with three sleeves
but you would definitely pet it 50% more
well flubs they usually flow downhill
well
i can't tell if you're just being a contrarian
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
if you know something is a dumb idea
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
everyone gives me a less than 1% chance
great challenge
why was it forced on?
well my sis is not with me
hint you cant
rit is not a state university
so the scholarship was from rit themselves?
"opportunity"
not a courtroom
compsci 1.5
reasonable amounts of sleep is for the weak
nah cuz if i did that i couldnt get on to the night terrors as quickly
first off, mood
and i just made up some 9 year olds new gamertag
second semester was more of the same plus a political science elective
flubs thats asymmetric i ahte it
pretty sure that's tje gamertag of a kid on my bus
i like using 489 in names because its very witty and im quite smart
this is epic
dont enter rem
this one
dude being sad about the future is next level
as i say
i'm in a permanent cycle of mad and sad
this is the biggest time i chased after a girl this deep
flubs if i managed to get her back, we are making an anthem
said nobody but my mom ever
or at least your postal code
i'm falling asleep from boredom at the same time
dragonite, you do cool things, stop
is it pronounced eye-er or err? who the fuck knows
no im lazy
yay for english
you know what pronunciation makes no sense what so ever
is hampshire not pronounced with the shur part
that’s the only way i’ve ever said it
black cats always win
i can love both
i want to pet my dog
but she's sleeping in dad's room and i dont want to wake up dad just to pet my dog
unnecessary
demon lord you should upgrade to a dog
cats seem so cute
nah jk i love my cats too much
i remember begging my mom until we got one xd
i want you to talk to brad about why python does or doesn't suck
why on earth would you want your code to execute _slower_
he's of contrary opinions
but nowadays cats are easier for me to take care of
fuck i should be sleeping
on the other, what kinda shitty ass parent would disapprove of a class that helps their kid be healthier and more active
but _that_ is the reason people should care not "oh no popular thing"
i tend not to like the kids who play it
1% chance to get her back
dab drago
i love when it’s snow season just to see the majority of you guys flip out
it just still feels way too early for this area's snow season. and it's not supposed to be winter yet
college girl and i talk a bit more lately on snapchat
couldve walked at that point
when you grew up in phoenix
yeah
bella i'm kidnapping you and forcing you to live in the temperate part of the country so you can suffer with the rest of us.
it doesn't have any sort of government
its land though
i think thats it station wise
as is the part of antarctica owned by america
and its got mountains
anyways i am gonna make an anthem
if it's about me
hard, the land we call our home
this, a song of sons and daughters
thanks i hate it
the bear thing killed me
again
he got the wrong target.
shall we watch again?
hmmm
sup pals
once you know what verbs and prepositions are english is pretty ehhhhhhh
hey drago
how much do i have to pay you to use that?
you’re fat
i just saw a kfc commercial for chicken and waffles that had colonel sanders dancing with mrs buttersworth to that “i’ve had the time of my life” song. where did we go wrong?
it’s the only explanation to how i find smash bros overrated
this tells me nothing; just as i expected
you should use my node script to generate random usually-pronounceable character strings
does rarity work?
well tbh i don't know either
im bored
i never knew you were gay ida
i just go with w/e
hey ida would you punch me in the face if i started shipping you with rainy
i got two gay big sisters yay
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
nah i wouldn't
rainy's cute, i don't mind
both regal and ida are gay i think
that sounds weird. with and without context, gummy
one hangs out with me through games and one hangs out with me through vc
poetic
hey i held my own in civ
i forgot it
wait i was dating a trans
its only rude if the person its referring to finds it rude
a trans?
so ask someone else
i dont wanna scroll whats up
rainy tell me that was a rhetorical question
"trans girl" is much less so
transgender*?
she is scaring me
my mistake
you already have a stockpile
the answer is violence, dear rc
you don't need legs anyways
vi stands for violence
gummy you have too many best friends
there's the daily dose of insanity
best friends would be ida, flubs, stormy, and breana
what a beautiful disaster this is
skarm, language
today a prof told me to make a medicine wheel
haha what a fuckin loser. being mentally stable sometimes. what a nerd
easy cure: make enzymes stupid
i love queer circles
gummy how dare you
she can wait her turn
i will individually break each and every one of your knuckles
hard to do that without hands, sweetie
this is just kingdom of introverted ninnies: 1 vs. 100
civil war...you are talking to a friendship and war general
been waiting for a year
but im like bi polar
i am genuinely happy that they see me like a younger brother
that's uh, most of the reason i made it
ditto with ida and master
here is a good joke
in that case do i have you guys' permission to change his name to "drago's toast"
that was suppose to be an insult
that would be awesome
i like trolling hardcore here
got my hands on nova prime. what do you think of this moon themed fashion frame?
that is what he asked
so the reason why i am crazy is because of trauma and me not being able to take orders well
i didnt realize that was nova prime but it looks awesome
talk to him about the birds and the bees
apparently he's also supposed to be 7'03''. i don't think i believe it that much
i also have nostrils but no nose
fight
this is fun
and when the truth finally dawns
clyde
lowering the brightness by like 20% did it
i had a shrimp today and don’t like shrimp, what’s wrong with me
help
i just need a hundred more watts to do something fun with the pokéwalker do i take the dog for a walk through the snow or just do a mile of circles in the kitchen again
she'a dumb and wonderful and spills over the floor
i’ll take your silence as “yes”
i am gonna do that
ida doing something crazy
im not human
i do wanna live there
so we are likely to get back together
10,800 seconds until fantastic beasts
who wants to count down with me
if you asked an order of seconds earlier i wouldve signed up
sick
it took me like a half hour to get out of bed this morning
it took me 10 seconds
just kinda...roll right out onto the floor
good job
where did you leave it for that to happen
it happened before i lost it i went to class in the rain a bunch of times
either that or my roof is leaking
mood
but it didn't make that much of an impact and far less people probably played it
i love pie
same, rainy
kingdom of introverted ninnies: civil war
i think it's that they look at the game with the highest accumulated review score
who even knows, all i know is that smash is probably not likely to get an award this year because of the december release date
so maybe ones like kotaku's review of the game might be a factor as to how xeno 2 didn't get it instead of dragonquest.
i like beef
thanks i think i was happier not thinking about that
must eyan stream when i’m not home?
the nirnroot one probably
i did once
weird
i dunno if he wants to play that
running on the world map that is not like frame rate or anything
i agree with imouto
would there be a challenge run for pokémon or/as
even if i wouldnt like them under any other circumstances
idk maybe im just weird but i never felt any reason to be nice to my parents
in which case its perfectly acceptable
same thing with my dad actually, you would think at first he's the nicest guy on the planet, but when you start to spend time with him, that's when things start to go downhill
also it's 4 am
oh okay
i get the whole 5 days to myself, no classes or attendence its pretty nice
hmm..
was a much needed visit because it definitely distracted me from ym stress and stuff and i was feeling lonely as shit this week
it’s always good to get out for a while
personal favorite kind is the one where it only gets funnier and funnier and you  can’t stop laughing, and you try to stop, making it funnier
that's only three hours are you okay
me: gets up, sees that it's just after 9 am
i can’t math rn. it’s ok lol
a bit at two, 3-6, then got up at 7:30
guys
never played either. both look ok to me
it's a running gag that i never finish anything and then have it destroyed
if im alive then ill do it
yes flubs you can once i am done with it
that was the plan
though pls don't upload nsfw
or attack anyone
errrrr
you are the best
yeet
there's your score
also like what do they matter at all
no math just made quantum mechanics make sense to human brains
without the catalyst of math the leaps to get here would never be made, not before the heat death at any rate
math bad
wait a minute why is dragonite on the side of the physics engine while im supporting the compiler
flubs say something funny
that is not funny
all right where's my provoking stick
i wanna pick a fight with this blade lord person
blade lord nayru*
you should pick a fight with like a bumble bee or something
tell me more tell me more
i wanna hear little dratini stories
pogi was the leader
interesting
what?
i worded it wrong but yeah
i was very close to one though
the most dangerous game
ida wanna talk about pie or something
that was drat—
actually there was more than one person...
i can't forgive that
i mean getting someone sent to prison ruins their life but if they murdered your parents it prolly justified
don't rely on flubs for it
flubs maybe just wait a little while before being morbid
its just an example of when sending someone to prison is ok
yes i do
okay new plan let me dig around
also its a picture
do you criticized all my pics and art?
insert obvious joke
so skyrim stream it is when i have time
gonna teach drago
but resetting every time you accidentally blow lydia off a mountain is annoying
why do you own all the dlc if you gave up ten seconds into the base game
play the very special edition
so you _did_ beat the tutorial bear
i rounded down a bit
hmmm
***hey dragonite did you hear your baby cousin won an award for marching band and was named ceo of earth, incorporated and has a girlfriend*** and by the way are you still like alive and stuff?
or lego® the lord of the rings™
oh hey digging through my pics
(◕ ε ◕)
the guy is rich flubs
which is 100% acceptable by the way
i can't play drv3
so don't watch that
dishonored
gummy you are already a dishonor why would you need to do it virtually
but dont 100% it because the dunwall city trials are fucking horrible
which are basically semiannual two-week black fridays
fair enough
but....
ram might go down in price in 2019
how many gb per hard drive do you waste on average?
all of it
no i definitely cant
well if you're ever looking for more harddrive space i think i saw a 1tb ssd somewhere for like $130~140
ssds have gotten cheaper
that's like their whole shtick
squid arent you boneless though
every day is black friday with newegg
lol wearing socks
socks are the only garment humanity needs
shinies are important
not if theyre on the right places
squid squid dont have bones
did you hear someone got sued by nintendo for running a rom site>
ill give you an omega ruby
and ive been trying to get out of those for _decades_
what..
its a gross answer you really dont want it
youtube just shitted itself again
ewwww
it's fine for me now after a couple minutes
i am angry
hi angry i'm etinogard
black bear
what show
micheal is almost about to leave 😭
why would i watch a show about offices i go to one every day
why would i need more of that in my life
then the name is a lie
charizard
the first season sucks flubs
i dont watch shows that the first season sucks for. because every single one of those shows is "oh that season isnt very good either it peaks around season 2 bazillion"
and literally everyone else asked them to stop and they didn't stop?
"these people literally behave like my coworkers why would i want to watch it on tv"
and you love the fat guy
i wouldntve watched that on my own
“fucknugget” is that a new mcdonald’s item? <:keepo:327304799919800321>
> math
i have been inspired this morning
okay, his favorite food is the fingers of people who aren't as smart as they think they are
drago's pet shop
would that be a place that sells like rna bubbles or something
post a video of that on twitter and youtube when that happens
ida if you don't know what those are you probably dont want to look it up
tarantulas can be pets
wasps. oh wait, that's deadlier
problem is
do you have like an atom bomb i can borrow
i can be sane when i want to
also creator studio bullshit is dumb
crap i was in need of a filled soul gem
can someone kill me
i got fired after
what does that mean
with a mod
surprisingly all of you recognize my waifu
welp
i'm going to leave it that way until march
that should probably tell you something
i know
im not gonna pressure
~~chicken breasts or real ones?~~ <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
yes sis
you mean 0.000000001%?
actually i expected something worse
oh ida hates me today
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ping me if you set up a game
it's most fun with like 4+
maybe when i have time wednesday
i could probably find a better one pretty easilyi though tbh
and master is russia
gummy you can be antarctica
no gummy can be germany
1815 for the first european one
apparently it came back
prob because of those
didnt you only break up like three days ago
flubs we need an anthem after this
few weeks drago
hey theres a statue of satan in a public square in kansas or something because of the confederation
drago actually watches history videos
i dont know if its kansas but kansas is in one of the two groupings of states that are all the same
all right i'm deleting the internet again
drago you are greedy
drago you suck at making a taco
i eat them so quickly does it even matter
worse.
why do you think im putting them in your sandwich
it’s stupid
what is the film class about?
there’s a lot more info about it than o ever realized
i hate film
without a controller
you haven’t gotten grades back yet?
oh damn i'm late i could've subbed in for drago on data structures
sounds like a fun one
wait you *aren't* trolling
hey hey just because i wanted a tyrannosaurus as a pet at one poitn in my life means it's okay for _everyone_ to do taht
im not
“what killed the dinosaurs? the ice age!”
only skyrim, fo4 and 76 so far run on creation
false: it’s a 51% chance
and even if its technically a different engine is it really *different*
well i dont like having a beard and facial hair because it's more trouble than it's worth
i'm surprised so many people want warrior.
flubs
to me, it's pretty boring, you just swing at shit
you played mage
but that one wasnt fromt he beginning i thought
it might be different now
so, uh, i wouldn't count on it anytime soon
just play better 4head
echoes is not the game to start with
i tried picking up fire emblem echoes last year but i couldn't really get into it
i should work on that
i just dedicate a day to steam games
my recomendation would be awakening since its my favorite and its the one i started with
good choice
i'm honestly not that interested in slay the spire
i kind of wanna play 100% orange juice
ive played the older games and for a first fe, awakening is probably the best choice
plus, im super biased towards it
it's kind of boring single player
i'm bored and kind of want to play some multiplayer....
ya'll are kind of making me want to stream even though i didn't want to tonight, lol
i just woke up from an exhaustion nap, hi eyan
holy shit flubs it's crazy
they all left me
cah sounds fun, they removed blank cards though
i'm down to  play
it's back, without blank cards
hey eyan, is it still possible we might see you play fire emblem?
hell no
wheres my money then
trust is not something you can always win back, especially if you screw up bad enough.  knowing your track record, i know what i'd be putting money on
blind luck
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
is reddit down?
but i want her to
yup but the plan this time was to fix it
true
all i can think of every time you bring this up
that might take a week
more
like huge
thats the 26
password?
they're close *to her*
like he literally just said
drago
got nothing better to do, might as well
damn u guys went in on gummy
i wonder who this etinogard person is <:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
linked in
no i just send death threats to it whenever it pms me about shit
i dont wanna get the thing tho
nonsense it's just soda poured on your hamburger so you dont have to eat them separately
exit
by the way flubs would you mine going up on my roof and fixing my tv aerial? i'll hold the ladder still so you dont fall and die
round 2 rn
we are all terrible. we are the hive.
good lord squid
also did the rules change? i appear to be getting the cards that i play but are not selected returned to me
rainy
the linkedin thing has a bunch of tags you can search by
hmmm
its not a murder if its by accident
how motivating
i understand how it works now
nobody cares about grammar
it's all about playing to the czar
look, the real gay agenda is necromancy
it was the card i drew that turn
based off who the czar was
oh my god
god bless rngesus
you need communication, an owlbear, and communication with said owlbear
about 33% chance of this being the last round
can you guys remove me on nov 23?
oh ida forgot to leave and rainy is typing
gn ida
nerds
somebody
well do it sooner rather than later, and by that i mean throw in the towel
all i have so far
got mine on fire mountain platform
wait
does this black card not even matter to y'all?
its great
of all of the cards that could have been on the screen when mom walked in
there are no such things as good cards
him and panda were both at 7/8
very carefully
i poked through the source in the inspect element button lat time i was the card czar
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
dammit
yeah but rainy is orders of suck above us just like gummy for orders of stupidity
ok but if i change it out
i dont knwo
not a single expression
in other news it turns out that telling a computer to figure out if two angles are close-ish to each other is _ass_
just a couple times every update
kugal are you a fan of modulo division
i really like the way gamepad drivers don't give you the angle that an analog stick is pointing and just make you do all the math yourself
he got paid for it too
a bunch of scientists did a study once about why we sleep and after a ridiculous amount of time and grant money they concluded that it was "because we feel sleepy"
someone got _paid_ to write that
theres nothing to do but be sad about the amount of debt youre gonna be in and get sicker by being around sick people
did you ever stop to wonder that like
dont even know what g++
is it a vape  or something
me: ok it's midnight i should go sleep
guys, im watching bob ross as i do hw and ive never been so calm
from scratch
not dead
once a _month?_
i think these stat questions are legit broken
well, ,i missed the last sat test for this year. so at this rate, i'm not going to be able to apply for college next year
i know that feeling
i don't think we have one of those nearby in corn central
the only test i had to take was an accuplacer and bam that was good nuff
just dont take the tests
i havent played a pokemon game for years ):
fair enough, rc.
darn, i wanna play games rn
so you pay to have a chance to pay to go to college
yeah, theres no guarantee
life
societal pressure, higher-paying jobs, dream jobs/careers, etc.. take your pick
not higher paying jobs for college?
did your ds charger not reach the wall outlet or something
basically something that you could do in glsl and expect to work the way you intended it
i can talk about generics and abstract data types all day dammit
neither are as easy as that
and liberty and the pursuit of happiness
i was gonna say something about doing what makes you happy no matter the cost but yeet
wait
yeah, who knows when that thing will get pissed and attack you
wait its probably a pound of water
different acceleration due to gravity
never heard of those
that's most likely wrong
the physics gnomes went on strike so gravity on venus is whatever it wants to be
yes, because venus isnt as massive as the earth
well we're not taking the atmosphere into consideration
but whys it a planet then
its not dependent on if its a planet or not
keep in mind i was like 8 lmao
yo momma thinks square roots are vegetables
everything that exists that has mass has a force of gravity
so the moon isnt a planet because it doesnt orbit the sun, and pluto isnt a planet because its too small
why arent stars in solar systems with two stars planets
because they dotn fill the criteria for classification
that’s what kids do: repeat the same shit a million times until someone yells at them
brb vacuuming up the planet's atmosphere so sound can't penetrate it
i'll just need a death star-sized bag that's all
first, they got to deal with the hundreds of thousands of people saying how terrible fallout 76 is
or they could just give me the code for the updated creation engine without all of the assets in it
it also doesnt matter because the atmosphere would dissolve your bones on venus before you hit the ground
theres nothing on yt i want to watch. send help
oh my god, ,the score for the ps4 version...
one channel i've gotten into the last few days is mother's basement
ok so the moon isnt a planet but has gravity. but rocks in space dont have gravity. why not.
im good (:
big yes
it is currently painful to keep my eyes open
but i got friggin stuff to do man i dont wanna sleep
i named my sister voldemort in my contacts and now i flinch every time she sends me a message
but you also didnt say all your suggestions would be as horrible as they are
serious is subjective
alright so i have to make a decision today. do i just eat turkey cold cuts with instant gravy on top or do i make myself an entire turkey and eat the same thing for a month
oh, i love the amount of chaos you can get from the crowd control extension on twitch
they were the same man the whole time
ew rom hacks
aight well ive got 50 minutes so ill go start now
i never said all my suggestions would be good
speaking of pokemon tho
three tiles
oh right, warframe is on the switch now
i havent eaten at all today. this sucks.
<:kreygasm:327309186515992577>
i'm bored
cant
join vc
soap
yes i know its terrible
he was a nice kid. gross though
how do you pat harshly
wack
or that one
also my nemesis is here
it's the one from mario
that everybody hates
that's hammer bros and bloopers
so far ive got a penguin, a bat, a little...thing? i dont know what youd define it as, a kangaroo like thing, and a light fixture
:boxthinking:
thats not irritating at all
...what is it
ive heard people refer to it as someone between 20 and 30
whatever that means
"whenever you want to blame something and dont know who to blame"
sure idk its name
i think the last one has a story behind it
i almost did that once fortunately the imposter site was trash and looked nothing like what the actual site looked like and i figured it out pretty quickly
just not happy
i'm definitely creating enemies with the let's go base atm
hi yes i’m a band man. can confirm woodwinds are the worst (like it just ends there at truth)
it’s great
i need to be at breakfast stream more
most of the time i am still asleep by the time it starts
~~now why would you accuse twitch grandpa of something like that?~~
speaking of bad man, some people in their patreon server might send stephen a shirt with “badman” on it. and mal is in on it 😛
i've seen someone in chat say that mark looked a little like gordon ramsay
but i hate to completely toss away ss completely.  i think the best way to handle those comments is to just prove them wrong this time
makes sense to me.
nier automata is 50% off
lemme check
dammit
my plan was to put together a smaller dream team than last time, preferably a more manageable one.  pretty much anybody who's a mod somewhere is at least part of the discussion though.
you take away my modship so you can kick me off the team
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
bella what i havent eaten breakfast since 2014
i don't want emotions antymore
is it really super secret though
i thoguht that said something else
not anymore
oh it's not grey
it's just a server that was built around my old skype group before we moved to discord
just find out how messy her house is and make yours messy to the same degree and she won't notice
just make it as messy as mine
i opened skype the other day and my eyes threw up
when is later?
squid i said i'd clean my room later dammit
~~so you’re a hoarder?~~
i just remembered today is when we get stuffing.
so prepare for reading
i’m so ready
so all of the things that i'm probably going to be awful at
i ain’t doing good at understandin’ your language
he'll never make it past that step
or he’ll get stuck at anger
france is still a relevant country
france is a myth
flubs is a myth
gummy i know you like ponies but you don't have to pretend to be a structure that - there is no way to end this sentence that isnt awful
im not a pony
though always wanted to be a girl for a day
gummy is the thing youre plotting the thing you told me about or something else
and it's working
oh gummy
now i look as superior as i am
oh flubs great news i got a new right hand man
i think i will teach him how to be like me
i threw so many tantrums yet always get something or someone i wanted
and i succeeded so thats why friend is jealous
that is not how that works
i havent eaten since 2 days ago, so im hungry, so i want to eat, so i will eat more than i otherwise would
she’s gonna tease me
makes sense to me
yeah but i get to eat at dinner time not lunch time
i always hated thanksgiving which is weird because its a lot of cooking which i love. but i hate eating so early and then being hungry at like 1 in the morning
gummy ive made like 5 loaves of bread its awesome
and a bunch of stuffing and turkey and shit
18 century military food is better
where is my invitation?
he wont?
so im coming soon
i just noticed how much food im making
what if i bring a cake?
maybe ill donate some of this or something because jesus this is way too much even for my fridge
this also lets me play pocket monsters all day
i have a question
me or your cousins?
unfortunately you
theres too many breaks
yeah not a fan personally
or creep her out ifk
you can give him money now and then flaunt it later
what did i juat walk in on
what about your pink?
role red
that is a combination of red and less red
cousins annoy drago
god no
you do that while i make my new anthem
and put them all in the same room
yeah thanksgiving in canada is not what it is down there
i hate it
new jersey accent
yeah that ones integration assigned, ida
im thankful for flubs
<:seemsgood:488173895246151680>
im thankful for ponies, my pony friends, war, and muskets
wow narcissistic much
ehh she spelled cornucopia correctly so its ok
some people give me a weird look when i do it irl since they can hear me whisper it
oh flubs tomorrow is cyber monday
flubs what should i buy tomorrow?
black friday
kitchen shears?
easy
if you dont need goggles normally you arent cooking right
but one of them went home and there is now 33% less dog in the building
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
master wanna talk opengl or something?
help
or your skin
but i made a server for the dnd campaign i'm running, and i had to make a channel for skyrim quotes because one of the players would not stop
lol ida
because i know 0 people from that state
bc im gonna put a hat on one but im not sure which yet
dan?
no we already have 8 players
the closest one is string cheese dan
tomorrow is black friday so i gotta go to best buy
tomorrow is national stay at home day
except we're going to see fantastic beasts for the second time so i actually wont
i keep hearing word about it, is it worth watching?
you need to know the hp storyline and the previous film to get any of it
but he is not awake as the same time as me
trust nobody
bella go see fantastic beasts right this instant
i just did the math and if i have this food for lunch itd take 3 weeks to make this not cost me more than normal lunch
i saw it already, dragonite
just took a calculus quiz but i feel like 3 of the questions were messed up
bc like you gotta celebrate christmas right? but idfk how to do any of that shit besides the food
about that
been stuck like this for a full minute now
nice
both
i dont mind turkey, its good, but i looked at what we're having and it looks 10 times better
stuffing? what is it?
stuffing indeed
kugal youve only eaten like 3 foods shut
its food and it is goddamn amazing
stuffing is life
then i remembered you're canadian
there we go
mr food expert
expert
mr food expert
whats the word. pm me it
errrr
mr food expert
i should probably drag my right hand man here for protection
help i want more pie
master
im definitely gonna be even a bigger pain
i can get ban sure
alright lets make this easy for you then
he still has an alt somewhere around here that he mentioned earlier
thats a nice way to put it majestic haha
do i want to know?
this is interesting
this is the only server i’m in that doesn’t allow me to change my name in the server
happy capitalism.day
we set a day aside to eat a fuck ton of food
fair point.
fourth of july is only american in name
also sometimes we get fireworks on thanksgiving around here
other countries dont have a fourth of july they only have a third and a fifth
but even so
we shouldnt have months and just have 365.241 days every year
wow rood
that wont work out
i have stuff to do, but really in the mood to watch a christmas movie
just hit the middle ground
mobile
the one i use way more
there was something dumb i wanted to write into here but i cant remember what it was
rainy i'm going to force you to re-watch the movie over and over until you change your mind
no, cause par doesn't originate from golf
there's still time to learn to hate python
functional 9/10
why am i bad at everything
well he doesn't seem to mind
duck
anyway, welcome
indeed. welcome.
i should get to doing this last stat lesson that i was gonna do last night
but i couldn't do it last night because mystatlab was under maintenance
what's it on?
the last lesson was on hypothesis testing between two samples, both independent and paried
your course was pretty damn fast. we're only gonna get to integrals this monday
just break webassign until he gives up using it
next semester im going into calculus ii
that’s some dark stuff lol
hey were always blue for me
guys did youtube change the color of these buttons or am i going mad
your face is infinity
everything else is built off of that
yeah what i said is infinity but in math form
there will be a good amount of limit questions
which is more differentiation lmao
like master said: everything is derivatives
one of my wisdom teeth just came in and i dont mind it
but dont like it that much
maybe i didnt take the derivative of my teeth enough
ive started getting fancy with how i eat the same 3 foods
no clue
how much mass in kilograms remains in your leftovers?
nice
oh definitely
and be stuck with my great-aunt?
what the crap
i made libre office pissed at me with a 3gb ram sheet
you know what's the absolute 100% best feeling in the world
either that or ill go into server settings when nobody's looking and add a greener nu role or whatever it's called
jokes on you ive been dead for years
you lack the qualifications of being fun
thanks
that's actually pretty rare
pretty much all of the reviews on all of the final fantasy games on steam say one of two things
hey master you know whats also nice?
that was me the entirety of bio a few years ago
some professors make you memorize them and suffer
if not, there should be
do it for the tense pre-presentation college students
annotations were ass
annotations were the big boxes?
porta podium
those were either great or horrible depending on the user
youre right they did it because it doesnt work on the devices that account for more than half of all playbacks, _and_ most of the others don't use them
a hundred years old???
bella that's a hundred years in internet time
thats my timeline
i think it was 98
that's a weird way of describing "the period before it's due"
in essence, today is a mess?
that way you have to be less on guard all month for packages
welp, guess emile's comment sections now will be flooded with chuggaaconroy cultists. not sure how i feel about that
just check the comments of the wooly world videos
curse mobile and making it hard to show that
for the past week or some like one or two other students would show up and just have me do all the work
today was the day no one showed for the first time, i was the only one
also i got a confirmation email saying im enrolled in calc ii, so thats neato. now i just gotta take my calc i final and kick butt and do my best and then i'll be on the road to more math lol
i think it's just average
how the heck is 100 average
no one knows why
as far as i can tell
im saying some would if 0 was the average
cause that's hilarious
i definitely do because im an idiot but for fucks sake just move the scale to a better place
but does a 0 baseline not make more sense than a 100 baseline
look at celsius since the whole world seems love that shit so much
its stupid where it is. keep everything the same, just move everyones iq down by 100
intelligence quotient
plus there's no benefit to having it 0 instead of 100
so it's impossible to get negative numbers
bollocks im not green anymore
the iq in this chat just dropped real fast
it makes me happy that two-year-old me is on average smarter than now-me
well, at a certain point it starts to decrease
well equations for this tends to be a stupid mess
the system was proposed by a psychologist
it took me 9 levels to realize you *use* the fancy rocks on the pocket monsters, dont give them to hold
though that would be cool
do you mean _your_ arms dont functionas swords
"you think you have anything on these guns?" *flexs a zookeeper into the stratosphere*
gotta make an email that wont be taken but will be looked at without being assumed to be spam
making throwaway emails is hard
wow. ive never applied to schools before and it’s kinda very scary
ok cool
nothin much whats up with you
not trying to one up the suffering contest
lol, i get them regularly
jesus, i feel so bad for you lol
i had to be nerfed somehow
i mean that'd be kinda cool now would it
hmmmmmmm
alright so i finally came back to my third run on emerald
i’ve used all of those except for delphox
also no greninja & charizard this time
what where the other ones
the hedgehog guy
delphox is the one with a wand or something right?
i was also so tempted to make azumarill a temporary team member yet again and choose crawdaunt instead
<:lul:305559915714576385>
even then i haven’t played either in a really long time
i had to do one of those stall battles against his milotic with my walrein
i had to pay 40 bucks for classes today
my game carts battery is dry
they use it?
but with fire red
the general opinion in the pokémon fan base that i strongly disagree with is that gen 5 is the best and gen 4 is the worst
did you turn off the animations when you grinded?
that is indeed how the cycle works
i definitely sent that right after she asked but ok
yeah, i still think the sequels in gen 5 are better than the originals
every game needs a mod that will randomly launch skyrim on any blackout/death
if did not go well.
the final boss was better
ehh, i either loved or hated the changes (or lack of change)
this is almost the exact same fight as we had recently
they probably didn't want it that you have to fight something that you can't use ingame
but that doesn't mean i will like it as a final boss
~~i think you mean climax boss~~
some people were annoyed with the changes to lusamine also
i thought the story in sun and moon was better than black and white. i just can’t be with everyone calling that the best story
and i haven’t bought a pokémon game in years
and with the let’s go games selling 3 million copies fast, i think it’s safe to say we will be seeing more let’s go games
i think people were just amazed pokemon was in 3d
also it was already confirmed that the 8th gen games will have a different engine to let's go and that they will be the best looking games in the series so far
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i am convinced that they just look sun and moons engine and made let's go in hd
let’s go looked more like x&y in hd to me
i don’t really like saying communities are toxic, because every single one has its terrible fans, but yeah, some parts of the pokémon fandom are awful
hahahahaha no
the most toxic and moronic nintendo sub community
anything popular, labelled toxic. even when it's a relatively great community
irrelevent
also to be fair
you have to play a game to give a score
sorry if my phrasing was bad
what was with the wait what also
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
btw were the motion controls a turn off for you also squid
since they’re not optional in tv mode
-rideable pokemon
-following pokemon
but i want traditional grass pokemon also
i made a whole team of 6 follow you around once that was a glorious mess
the region is on a pokemon?
yes torterra is basically atlas already
if roman culture had cars there would most definitely be a son of the dirty for luck for traffic
hephaestus
because he's like perpetually drunk and that would explain a lot
greek is better
brb getting food
personally i'd call in archimedes
it’s manageable for what characters it’s got
ted talk? this doesn't really feel like one of those
essentially, greeks are cooler
welcome to masters, bellas, and dragonites ted talk
i  seee
greek seems to have stuck the most, but it certainly spread tech progress across the isolated nations a solid amount
truly too ahead of their time
are you comparing roman nanotechnology to bird doo
are you implying bird doo is electromagnetic radiation from the birth of the universe?
we can map out the entire chicken genome, put it onto a computer, then broadcast that via wifi which is really radio which is really electromagnetic radiation. thus you can radio people chicken shit
algetty--legacy code cavern
algettu has been revitalized
honestly the last half hour of talk in here is what enhasa should be like
darn
which ones enhasa
i wonder if youtube api allows you to get a list of discord users from those that join a channel
d position/dt = velocity | d velocity /dt = acceleration | d acceleration/dt = jerk
oh well maybe we just havent advanced far enough as a society to make use of inte or polo
i was curious to see if my calculator could do large sums so i inputted an infinite sum only to 100000 terms and it the calculator took 20 minutes to evaluate the sum
here let me get the sum
lemme c++ that real quick
master you do it for me im tired
even if ya did then it still shouldnt be that high of a number lol
is that not what you entered
probably
lucius appuleius saturninus, a tribune, passes a law to redistribute land to military veterans. the law requires that all senators swear to abide by it. quintus caecilus metellus numidicus refuses and is exiled. he goes to rhodes to study philosophy.
this does not help me
i need a nice corner couch to work on
we're all going to die anyway
i dont have a good word for it but its too round i guess

as in, your hungry right?
flubs you're light red
and aphrodite
hahaaaaahhh
thats a new low for you
15 out of 100
and what is the score of 15 from? the roman thing?
this is about the purity test, isn't it?
you *must* know what that is
well,
cah?
it takes being the most horrible to have that moniker
i've got to work morning concessions tomorrow. because we need basketball games in like 9 in the fucking morning, an elementary game at that
done
but as for why they have them, i'm guessing it's because they think their job is the greatest of all tiiimmemeee
didn't help also that it took forever to get the nature and ability i wanted for my azurill also which needed to be happy to evolve, so that was fun with all of that walking xp
like why do i need to justify everything with this guy lmao
is it me drago?
radio silence speaks volumes
let's try and get eyan in, it's friday
rainy i hate to say this
you can say it
i'll only kill you a little
i can't even
only after accepting your low lewdness stat can you grow it
i prefer not being arrested
oh i can grow it alright
(ssh, not here, rainy)
(maybe later)
you underestimate how dumb i am
so you're like 80% of the way there already
though asthma makes nerds, not nerds get asthma
i have one semester's experience with uni compsci
canary or default?
i feel exhausted but i only got through day 1 of 5 days of working in a row. again 😑
(◡‿◡✿)
that’s how i am right now
squid stop hating things
the fuck is it?
also aaa the second half of the last episode was pretty good but now its so boring
i hope i was at least useful boss
what the crap twitch
weeks ago
this will be on r/enlightenedbirdmen by the end of the week
shut up it's owls
kugal died on the streamed xcom run a few weeks back.  this is a run i started up on my own time because i was craving more xcom
nobody yet
i'm a month and a half into this run and it's been exceptionally smooth
you should use me as your meat shield because i'm probably the skinniest person ever
the worst part was bella got hurt really bad by the assassin which knocked her out for a while but other than that, it's been smooth
is it a coincidence that deci just came online or are you two planning on league?
rain is in this playthrough and will probably see more attention than the last one.  😛
also buh bye ida
as soon as i get a chance
just find the fountain of eternal life
hooray time for another round of me putting off contacting any of you until sunday afternoon when everyone's packing up
i look wonderfully grumpy, thank you
you think that's bad? i'm just gonna drive 24 hours and kick in their room door
i’m already argonian
how do you say "cheese" in dovahzul
super nerd army
okay mrs. e. wastaken
nope, title is the former
i thoguht your original discord username was really clever until i saw a couple other people with the same name =/
i hope so
also i can also confirm that the friends suck ass in this game
just guess san diego enough times and youll eventually be right
who remembers when memes had effort put into them
yeah me neither
no its just old fashioned
also what happened to not worrying about details and "fuck it just do it" in regards to youtube?
oddly appropriate then
it still takes some details ya ninny
what has r2d2 been up to?
well thats the most efficient way to use a flamethrower
what else was there
you guys are up late
i am at least
i like the lack of `the` and `a` in latin, makes taking quick notes a lot easier
rainy just popped online
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
romans didnt know it existed lol
dont have time to wonder into the  endless vastness of space
cool
easy way to not get least to greatest confused in roman numerals: iv xl lcd dm
perfect
alll valid abbreviations in modern language
iv unit, extra large, liquid crystal display, direct message
have you seen how romans counted with their hands before
the reason i still call them "private messages" is because every time i see "dm" i immediately think dungeon master
ive counted to 4 in binary on my fingers a few times
also doesnt matter if you use thumb or pinky as 2^0
weird til "our" and "your" are only off by one letter
good for compression i guess
something something noose nice
oh wait no that would have to be nouse
you can sleep in gym
you can sleep in now
that's unusually specific i feel like the author was either really bored or actually got run over by one
i didnt realize this until my current 3 heart run, but oot ganondorf has quite a big nose when looking at it
...after i read that thread and sleep
welcome, have a baconator 🍔
finished writing my chorale\
most video game characters do
is it gilgamesh?
made it myself.
here's a gilgamesh one.
ida would you murder me if i asked what a gilgamesh is
my parents recently got new speakers for the living room so they’ve been playing music loudly every night for the past couple of days 😐
not here
was recording something today and something catastrophic almost happened
what happens if it gets full
my mom would break physics
can i leave nickname ideas in the stream?
do famous astronomers
hubble, galileo, brahe, kepler, etc
~~name a dratini after me~~
greekid
yeah but it's about eleven characters too long
all of them, but sceptile probably won't get much use
it's very bad
think about it dragonite, going to go eat, get back to me later when i stream
we're live by the way
i’ll be watching the stream after i finish watching raw
connect your twitch to discord
oh, how do?
does that bot help with music theory and the resolution of v7 chords?
i can but im not gonna do that quite yet,
i shoudl teach him to pick apart subjects, predicates and conjunctions and jam them together to produce semi-intelligent unique dialogue

welcome
til boxbox watches chugga
hey look i bothered to log in on my main account in class today!
i wish
that aloix guy is a fucking loser
too bad
it won't snow on my watch.
just finished decorating one of our two christmas trees and found an old ornament from when my mom was young. a wooden cow. 
very mooooving
squid i'm going to have to remoooooove you from the gene pool
is that going on right now?
oh, it happened earlier
the teacher is talking about fishing with a guy who isn't in the class
this is interesting
so i told my teacher that i'd put documentation comments in the branch of the class repository i was working on so whichever poor sap who's unlucky enough to have to merge it back in doesn't want to punch me in the face
oh human
first come, first serve.  makes sense for this sort of thing.
i don't have much left and i'm going completely from memory because i'm at work
but they won't get much use so i was thinking of giving them to my not so active but big time past donators
just my shorthand "draco" would suffice.  i know it's not fitting for a metagross, but it's less complicated that way.
now tell me a story
not really a "story" per se, but you were the first person i watch on youtube ever and for the first few months, the only person i watched.
middle-school me really enjoyed your content.
well you don't actively make videos right now. 😜
and i wish for the best on that.
same
now that's a good story.  😛
i found your stream randomly, you were doing solo queue for league and wearing your teemo had.
i can only beat most of them on normal.  i have beaten a few extra stages and hard runs on the easier games though
you think you'll ever play fan-made scripts?
i feel lonely, sad, and bitter, despite being surrounded my a lot of awesome people.
i'm sort of in a similar position, only with college instead of work.
well hopefully i'm doing a decent job at distracting you.
it's going to rough for me for a while, i'm hoping i can channel my frustration into the rebirth of a new youtube era
i'd be lying if i said i didn't have a lot of fears about it though
i appreciate that.  right now, i think support is all i need
i am here
i'm worried that nobody will care, the world has changed around me quite a bit, but from a youtube perspective, i'm still the same old derpy kid who just wants to screw around with videos
i know that feeling all too well.
i just don’t have standards because i know my videos are terrible <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it's just that i have baggage that i didn't have 11 years ago, and it's hard to ignore it
i actually like the sound of that
want to do it?  😛
it seems like a huge liability, lol
rainy, you are one of the most important people in my life
what?
there’s this thing called falling asleep by midnight
yeah eyan, i'll cover for you, i'm off, go grab a nap
i couldn't sleep right now anyways
i avoid it like the plague
chamomile tea. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i will admit though, i'm surprised how chatting with you guys isn't actually hurting my productivity that much
you heard it here first folk.
yup, i do it all the time in the kitchen, knife in one hand, phone in the other
i'm usually 8-4 if i'm in the front, or 6-3/4ish if i'm in the kitchen
git gud
yo eyan, ping me wherever if you want, i'm get a tiny bit more sleep
will do, it's actually my lunch break so i'm going to dip for a bit
plenty of sleep time
eyan what is this "sleeping like a normal person" thing you speak of
that sounds dreadful
somebody
the end
hey nerds
bella!
tis a good story
i’m on the bus right now, it’s been raining pretty much for a whole day and thankfully there’s no one on the sidewalk. it’s like a full on tidal wave
i love snow though, it's just what the doctor ordered for my crippling depression
no thanks
i couldn't live somewhere where 50 was considered freezing cold
50 sounds good when you’re stuck in the 30s all winter
what’s the hottest it gets around there?
i'd rather move north if i had to go anywhere
i said special twice
that’s special
i'll probably stream skyrim as soon as i get home tonight
wow, choosing that over me, i see how it is
it sounds lewd
it's been a rough week.  >_<
definitely
just human
oh god, that's terrible
nobody should want to be reincarnated as me
when i was 11 or 12 i managed to find a way to romanticize alcoholism
so that was neat
besides, i'm not stupid, i'll be in a call with friends to watch over me.
it's at least good that you're venting, though
it’s good to get it out
oh you’re working right now? didn’t know that
how long does that take? like, does that take your whole shift or just most of it?
it's beginning of the month so we get a lot of monthly bills around this time so i've been building up for the last few days to a day of just sitting around posting them
so, to answer the question, some days it can be my entire shift, other days, not as much.  i'm "accounts payable" though so my job is pretty much just to pay bills
eyan, outta curiosity, do you see a therapist?
i legitimately think i'm doing swell enough though that i don't think it's worth my time
i have a bad habit of finding an excuse to not see one
much cheaper solution
learn to drive
thanks guys
working out does good things, therapy wise
the king has spoken. you must drive
understood
oh cool flood warning.
i've been able to talk to my mom about my issues
no it's called fun mode
since she knew exactly what i was going through
i’ve been on a trip from cali to the midwest. it takes so long
i can’t imagine one side of the county to another
i've taken plenty of 4 hour drives that i'm pretty used to them by now, but that's about my limit
i can obviously do more, but it'd have to be a special circumstance
i tried driving briefly but it was way too stressful for me
so now i take the bus
i think my record is five hours
shouldn’t be too bad
holy crap it's brad
4 hour drives?
i can do more, i just learned that once i got to about 3 hours, i started not liking it anymore
driving is fun for a while
this may not be the brad you know
i know it's not the brad i know, lol
i can drive for about 30 minutes alone in the car before i get really depressing thoughts
dont die eyan
why not fly if you have to drive 7 hours?
money
oh wait bella was leaving eyan you can die if you want
try a 9 hour plane ride
f
again
oh no eyan is dead
i usually stop at a denny's in middle of nowhere wyoming
and drink a few dozen cups of coffee
oh fuck guys, i think eyan's actually dead
i'm a capitalist at heart
and i'm sure she wouldn't mind paying interest anyways
wow, way to assume and talk about me like i'm not here
i mean
you aren't wrong
i try my best
i'm pretty sure she was just looking for an excuse to agree to giving me that in the first place.  😛
you bastard
gift horses? are you planning on sending eyan a horse for christmas? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but "no futher punishment" is not a complete sentence
you’re not a compl
i’m not allowed to do anything around here
aww, that explains it
thanks
<:lul:305559915714576385>
ill be back in about half an hour if i get through volunteer duty fast
i'm a grinch, who needs santa hats
also
guys, i think i just hit the lottery
good job (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
yeah
you getting called up would have been something
i agreed to give it to deci if i got called
although i kind of prefer the more...natural kind
kinky
gatdangit, gummy.
i demand that somebody tell me a story
once upon a time, a squid had to get ready for work. the end
there once was a hero named ragnar the red
both of them
i demand the story of ragnar the red stop
i want an original story
ok here's a story i'm recycling right now and the teacher decided to take a shortcut through the blizzard to go grab bags for recycling
too many scales for me
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
try setting it on fire
impressive
wait
that's the maids job
wow lewd
also nice unintentional double entendre
high five
i watch them for the same reason you watch gross surgery videos. you know its gonna suck to watch but you just cant look away
well they arent that popular and have caused a lot of problems for youtube
i thought at least jake would be in it
jake was in it; at least the last couple of episodes
yo fuck thats a good point
also bella, not a kitten
he wanted to come with us
she is a cat
the cat _is_ the maid
cosplay is acceptable
didnt she fucking murder subaru though eyan
like i know it was a misunderstanding but she still murdered him pretty hard
only payment i have is love, is that acceptable?
and my body
i'll pay for all of your needed maid expenses
beacon of feminism as i am, i've always wanted to be a maid
i can cook and clean like a goddess
i could be like the butler who always falls asleep and plays ds games on the job or something
oh sweet, i didn't think past this step cause i didn't think it would happen
i like maids
i'm pretty sure rainy is like
i forgot i could do that
hey, not quite ;-;
how tall is ida?
of course to keep it in proportion youd have to remove the forearms and the middle of the torso
i guarantee i could princess carry you
so maybe rem is more apt
and how tall is ida?  lol
pretty sure ida's liek 6'2
6' 1"
we are strong independent women
i feel like i really want to know what some of you look like
nice
yeah but i could’ve been like... 5’10
yeah but who cares about a slight difference in height
my cousins have giants for parents so they’re all tall and it’s annoying
i think one of them is nearly 7 feet
just means you can attack the abdomen easier
now we need a disappointed head butler. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but i'm fine putting you third in command rainy, lol
secretary, coo, depends on the year, but i'm always trying to do something useful
hey 9k
he's the butler
so basically arlon?
yeah, but i'm sure he would prefer dark lord of the sith and hand of the emperor
rainy had a soul? this is news to me
not anymore
cats
you ca be the daedric prince of cats
eyan, daedric prince of walkthroughs and ninnies
that's molag bal's domain
yeah, neither do i
indeed
i don't really know what i want
for somebody to fill the void of emptiness in my life
well i'm pretty tight with azura, and she knows all bout that void shit
cause holy fuck i make amazing pizza
love made with  pizza sounds mediocre at best
and i thought i was boring with just cheese
tacos are the ultimate form of food evolution
i get the feeling you secretly want to actually be my maid, lol
secretly?
have fun affording that
not attracted to me, i see how it is
hey you're  cute hon
just roll with it
sounds to me like you're killing two birds with one stone
that's an odd form of precipitation
and proud of it
it's not my fault you have shit tastes realmaster
i am merely a man of class
that's why i prefer boobs
public class lower{
eyan;
}
but i've got an ass that you need to install a mod for
i never said i disliked ass, just i'm more of a boobs guy, lol
you done with work?
i would do that shit seconds before it's due
good job
later, eyan.
\*and he was never heard from again\*
did ya guys see youtube rewind 2018 came out today lol
but we got out early enough that i won’t miss the bus so at least there’s that
hay thats a plus
would i be bombarded by people’s surprise if i said i have never heard it before
i used to watch his stuff as well back in the day.
<:kappaclaus:520412032042926080> and <:kingofchristmas:520412492787089408> are here for the holidays
panda is alive
audible gasp.
how is red dead 2's music and art better than god of war's?
just dont watch shit you dont like, and if you do want to watch it for whatever fucking reason, dont make it our problem
i should not be allowed to have this much fun
guys it dawns on me that maybe eating a large amount of coffee ice cream just before midnight might not have been the best idea i ever had
i just want you all to know i went to bed at 6 so i could wake up at 1 am and play smash until work at 4:30 am
so i’m not allowed to not like something popular? don’t act like you never go through it
greetings, eyan.
i've certainly gotten salty because of popularity for things i didn't care about.  it's not really a logical train of thought though, that much i will admit.  dragonite is right, why drain energy into caring about what's popular
but that's being human imo
it could be quite terrible so don't be too excited.  😛
~~if it makes you feel better, i would probably be worse~~
current game plan for salvation of the project is making 3d models then getting the angle just right to have them align with an existing stock photo of a person using a product
his channel was my childhood
but still a revival of some form.
i see..
here, anyway
will we get the old camera filming the top screen? lmao
probably like, the end of my yt career level video combined with early yt career level editing
we'll see, the theme of right now is "screw it, just do it"
it's people like you who stop by and remind me that i'm still remembered for what i accomplished so long ago
you got two parts in and then stopped.
remember the good old days of eyan pronouncing pokémon as “pogeymon” 😛
also sometimes it sings
and sometimes it makes threats
emile goes on a noa rant for two minutes and fifteen seconds
anyone know what time the stream will be?
this is important
there's a 30% chance that i'll actually mess with it tomorrow though since it's a toss-up between that, homework and ddd
i really should sleep aaaaa
gday m8
ooof, drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.  how could i forget the golden rule
\:thinking\:
way to speak to my soul
how bad was last night's footage for youtube, lol
as a sober person, it wasn't that bad as of before i left
i think reality is slapping me over the face again
not sure how to feel about that
no more than normal at least
edit yourself
that didn't work
make me
i wish i could edit myself
not a half bad idea
\:thinking\:
good luck friend
next final after this is my calculus final
ah, the best kind of reward
my birthday always sucked cause it was always pretty much guaranteed to be right after winter break.  it was different in college though so that was nice
oh nice
the college classes usually start later than my highschool semester but they also end earlier too
oh boy, calculus ii here we come
never took it, glad i didn't, lol
friggin hell yea man
but i legit thought i failed my calculus i midterm but got 97%
i fucked up the curve several times in one of my entry level finance classes
otherwise i would have failed it miserably, lol
i think i only had 2 cs though, maybe even one, i can't quite remember
thats not too shabby
i was quite proud of myself, especially for coasting the later half
except for that one semesters in freshman year in highschool
gotta eat breakfast, bbl
to me i saw 'breakfast' and it's fairly early where i am so i was like "yea makes sense" in my head lul
probably after i start uploading to youtube again
yeah, i’m about to walk into work so i’ll miss pokemon
oras starting now <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
i wonder what would happen if i went around introducing myself as "mr spam"
this stream made a bunch of people join
i said skarmory, not skarm jesus christ
hola y'all
i’m back from work. eyan still streaming?
<:lul:305559915714576385>
so you did
calculated that back in june
there is no reasonable hour
oh i've come to terms with this revelation a loooooooong time ago pal
perfect thanks
science has truly gone too far
did you record a black screen again eyan
soon™
vods?
then if your local recording doesnt have sound you can pull down the video from twitch, extract the track with just the game audio, and use that
why do anything simple when you can overcomplicate it
—dragonite family motto
welp
🎉 ?
welcome
i remember
congrats
welcome to the show
why does it mention that you have the everyone role
i feel like most people have that one
you know it occurs to me that if i didnt procrastinate my homework earlier i'd be able to join stream now
if you send me the original pic i can do this with a better resolutino
i’ll try it first, but thank you
engrossing
what if someone sets twitch on fire?
all of them
or the finger one
specifically the middle one
you mean the finger lakes? because those exist <:kappa:374346980136058893>
50 mins
don't shift the blame to someone else skarm
what _does_ this coast hve
a lot of pollution probably
that’s west coast
darn it squid
is it really
that was a fun stream
welcome peeps
lots of new people
yes! thank you kugal i thought i was the only one
dang it it’s for the holiday spirit guys

i had to bother a company twice for a model, got it with half the dimensions missing, did pixel measurements for the rest, made the 3d model and now i need to orient it and throw it back into a stock photo using the product plus our accessory
ironically it’ll be like 8 in the morning when it’s my turn

i couldn't tell you a single thing about pretty much any presentation i ever watched
i dunno, i'm in a weird state right now
i just have to stay tough and work through it i guess, but damn if i ain't impatient and angry about the fact that i have this stupid thing called emotions
to fix it.
youd be surprised
i could flip my loneliness to  smothered by far more attention that i could ever desire, lol

hrm...  alone i'm not too sure, but if i were working with someone on revising it, i'd feel more confident because we can bounce ideas off each other.
but if i start doing the weekly series, it could come into play
i'll put it into mental filing cabinet #254. 😛

film was fun,
got some friends that are really good at it
thankfully we did have to produce it. there would be no way
dude, film school is even crazier han that animal man
thankfully i stopped before i got to that level but the production of things is just overwhelming looking
sheesh.
people also complained that it took too long to cover a game, which, i mean, that could be arguably a fair critism
usually people only complained about that for new games though
you aren't wrong
hopefully being a little older and wiser will make it easier this go round if i succeed again
