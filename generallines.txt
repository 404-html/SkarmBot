and thats it
ive been banned from a server from my username
but is that an ssd
maybe i should watch less anime
wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
even though i didn't know what the hell i did wrong
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
only a bitcoin miner is gonna want this anyway so why are they limiting them
you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
byezers
perfectly fine.
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
do we need a heart for each upgrade?
and does the stump have to be chopped for each of its blocks and not even drop any wood?
that means you swung to attack.
i though drago said fashion for a sec
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
i already deleted all of the installed mods, along with my character and world out of frustration since **no one** here was using the internet besides me
it was, ida.
i dont really rage at games with good mechanics, so im having a blast
i would not reccomend playing it regardless. i'd rather play four swords adventures than tri force heroes
so i'm going to blame overhaul for my lag
fine fine
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
it changed my keys
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
i think i left my cactus armor somewhere
just a reminder that 3 diamonds are needed for the storage heart.
i don't know.
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
so much we made a new funny class meme or word
\:thinking\:
oh ok, we'll wait for that then
gummy i will destroy you if i have to
and people actually like her music
thanks
i mean...on a normal day everyone is an asshole
currently -23 here
all 3
it gets to like 110 sometimes in the summer where i am
i haven't watched a movie in a long time
what is it stuck
quup off
we lost guys
hmmm interesting
either way cool
its like how i have a lot of pictures of pregnant luigi
what?
his brother recorded a dead man
:^ )
flubs did not read pawn
sugar
i try to hold back.
is makeup
i want to believe they are
i’ll send it to flubs because why not
it has music playing in it
he isnt a child
it's not that easy
yeah sure why not
don't want to burn out too quickly after all.
wait wtf
who’s that green loser?
brb pasta is overflowing
i need to take care of things irl tonight so i don't think we'll be able to have a session tonight.
hey gummy boop me, for, uh, science \*cracks knuckles\*
hopefully once we get some more life crystals we'll be able to take down eow faster.
uhhhh
or slightly behind because effort
that should be accurate
the c word that isnt crap
well i'm sure there's more than one.
and your name is rarity now
you can ask permission from someone whose not the owner and its still stealing though
if you buy it for a year you get two months free
oh no i didnt mean the food
my pasta
get that checked out
wowza that's a huge emote
its so dumb looking
yes ida
okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
thats why
hey flubs
spooky
he's probably twenty one in dog years
me helping this person will be interesting because this time my age from this person is actually far apart. i’m way younger but i gotta think older and smarter
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
.
anyway, i have to go to bed no-- hours ago thanks to time zones so bye
i don’t even know what that is
now i want pizza...
fine but if i go to bed before then i expect you to be honest
make games
that’s the word
benny has won a total of $10,000 so far
flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night
i can't tell who raised the hand on mobile
christ, and it takes like an hour to launch, too
it's just 30 of them.
got battlefront 2
leona mid?
the p stands for "public", silly goose
perfect ida
heh heh you see what i did there?
breaking dirt
??? it's already 1 pm
i have one pencil tho
i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
this better work
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
not just his poor performance
because i couldn't
you got two hours left come on sarah what the hell dont walk away come on just play some more we're almost done no please dont leave
eating it
all of my interests are video games <:lul:305559915714576385>
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
it would take forever to upload 1080p for me
i dont really care what quality its in
that's not a person gummy
i could tell they were being flirty also
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
because it is soooo important for me to self promote myself
good
so i dont like the beach
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.
i hate this professor so much btw
plus i got stuck
he effed an underaged student
presenting is fun!
talk about that
those are the best easymode wings you can get your hands on with thorium
we need to defeat him so that i can get bronze alloy fragments from the marble enemies
yay my uk friend finally woke up
waffles or pancakes
and we're still in easymode
but why will it be a pain to me specifically?
we died so many times to it
damage?
caffeine is a drug
also this is gonna be the last boss
then they're a very messed up family
i got lucky with most of my accessories
what if they're tryingt to destroy the world?
minus ore seeds.
is master the most powerful he can be so far?
we're not going to use old copper tools
what's the damage like?
if you know you definitely took everything, try to think about other things
i question if ida ever watched myself
do you drink cold water then?
what other browser would u use?
what?
i will show you the cock
nah i don't feel like keeping track
episode 2 predicted episode 3
i didn't know that you were you
come join
your name has baconator in it.
hes been like a borther to me
i'm not trying to sound offensive but y'all seem kinda trict
depends on what kind of cheese i guess. i havent tried every single type of cheese so i cant say for sure
....
i've only seen up to the jar of dirt movie
i have it once a week
porates
i’ll make the knife go away
i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
side note, i made the deans list o:
im constantly on here and not even up to date on the spreadsheets i made for one of the classes. not doing anything officially extracurricular.
sooooo
i poked my fan with a pen and it stopped not running
...my computer died again
because she did the forcing/blackmail
ate 1/3 of the one in that photo during dunch today
what would be the offchance of the magikarps having absurdly high speed stats <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i meant blackmail becoming blackma- shit nevermind that doesnt work
wait you guys actually think that's actually that bad?
a true family
i never show it though because i just mess around here
it's worth a try
the civil war is so interesting, i really enjoyed reading about it
let's just say it had blackmail in it
oh trench warfare is wasy to understand
i love old warfare over modern warfare
oh yeah just like ww1
and early modern
the sad part is, the businessmen back home were profiting from all this
his generals did everything for him
he never was a miltary genius
but they had the big bad usa on their side
previous mistakes were repeated
>that moment when you realize the devourer of gods stands for dog
that’s just really black and white to see it
peter the great
i can't at this point master
it was probably the fries that gave you away
yeah so
i see her bestie giving her a second chance though from what i have seen
more disappointed than previously i'd like to assume
haha! you cant block me if i destroy the discord servers!
while, i take less classes these classes somehow managed to be longer.
dont get civ 6
i’m tired
the elder dragon
i need the sleep because of college 😑
also, did you try fighting skeletron already?
sounds comfortabale for the eyes
although i just lost connection
e!says-add i don't know what to do, its working!
whats the screenshot keybind again
if i wasn't, we wouldn't have been able to beat the bosses.
not like the npc is going to be useful to us now
i also got a granite boombox.
good time of day.
teh bass on the right?
actually, i think i might have gotten one of those.
i was expecting ice cream tho tbh
i'm kicking overhaul out for the next server
i don't think we could even attempt doing death mode
-spirit
-calamity
and better bard bits would've helped me do better too. <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
it's fine, wolve.
-elemental unleash
we didn't have a flat world
i've been attempting to dig trenches to stop it spreading to the other half of the map
ah yes, the bees.
like the soc.
krelian, please. ^_^;
it used up every single free bit of space on my drive
yes play the terraria
forget it ida
this morning the same was true for me but that was because i'd just been feeding the sheep
not even close.
yeah, that
taking a break from playing 2 hours of blazblue.

oh fuck
i can imagine the banner having stickfigures in it now
im not making another.
ok i got panda set up
besides the memes
canterlot equestria
i'll tell you about flubs pm
it takes...a lot...to make me hate someone
i don’t wanna get slaughtered
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
...on
the second semester uno distracted me
i have a russian accent except for when i dont which is 99.99999% of the time. i can only do it when i screw up when i try to speak english while translating from russian while talking to parents
you have a biased sample
....
speaking of playing, we just beat plantera in our game
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
it’s not
bass
i am slowly learning more on how to talk like her
just walk away slowly, animal man.
not that, you ninny.
and say "thats what i was gonna do"
ayyyy
heartgold and soulsilver
it's pokemon black and white and according to drago black and white was amazing
caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
put it in the r4 card thing slot
press f to pay respects
cosplay as rarity
if you wanted to put on makeup that implies you don't have any makeup on.
rc wanna see the full pic?

close enough
i'd volunteer to do that but i'm too lazy
i forgot
here, i have one
sorry
can i say i’m really excited for the teen titans go movie?
i’m pretty sure none of us have wives, flubs
i’m still demisexual straight btw
but i take the blame
gummy i read a story where fluttersy gets kidnapped and turned into a sex slave then is tortured into becoming a sex addict, i think whatever is in your story is fine
like idk
no cadance i haven’t
he also is attracted to me
nope. not once
bollocks
i can’t show it to you
oh fuck
owo drago hitting his bad bot with a rod
i assume this gilgamesh dude is your waifu ida
that isn't me
its in
(also it's not real love, it's a fictional character for crying out loud)
“the fact that you were trying to make it scary is the cute part” - my friend
he just doesn't have a shirt on.
husbano is for females waifu is more male
are you talking to me in the last message flubs?
and who cares if it’s fictional
tackle and surf
and hey a new person
try a battle potion maybe?
the paul brothers are loud. you want more of them?
and...splash
hmmmm
they just subbed to me and followed me on twitter
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
fear
makes me feel like i accomplish something
good
~~ill have fun hehe~~
i see.
in her defense cabbage burger sounds really, really awful
and than just use one of the other picks till we have enough for another one <:lul:305559915714576385>
though i really like ivan the terrible
when women were only valued for their birthing skills
did we download anymore mods
money chest
well not only birthing
you know who was also a good tsar?
and now they exist again
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
you were like
i already explained it to like idk
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
panda hit me with a bat pls
jeez i didn't make much progress there and i'm already feeling tired
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
he didnt make the song...
super balanced
antiaris is being made by the official tremor team.
i saw that they received a massive rework on the wiki.
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
the hallowed megaphone
midnight?
a rarity plushie and a tricorne/bicorne hate
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
i might've forgotten the recipe
(the one problem with that is i'm trash at modeling robots)
ho-oh
i think that's calamity
idk never played it either lol
drago these are one of the few times that it is necessary
i.e. spreading jungle to fix our corrupt jungle issues.
i thought panda meant me for a sec lol
its gotta be true
our generation is stupid
i'm at1038.
my favorite kind of idiot is the guy who goes on webmd and is convinced he has x horrible disease. what the doctor says doesnt matter. he has it. minor foot pain after hurting your foot? brain tumor. ate too much and your stomach hurts? 5 ulcers.
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
do not participate in the life ruining juice
why eggplant?
henlo wolve
now the npc is attacking me for no reason : (
i'll record a gif of it once i get it looking nice
only it was for like 10 minutes
rarity pkushie made in the uk
yeah, that might be treason
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
ban them
especially since they make ones not in the uk
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
at least say she
just not as much as actual smoking
everyone said it
when you least expect it
good night
not the fictional one
everybody do the flop
what
physics is evil
yeah, why?
im bored
honestly knowing me since i can’t fit a mlp song actually i might but i am leaning towards a military song
hello.
just stand there while everyone dances
glhf
no, it is literally the opposite
i reversed your message
you know rainy is right flubs
that's not pony stuff
hgss is my favorite remake
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
platinum was the last game to have it
gummy its totally bc its you
at least she thinks im lovely
we all did
that’s photoshop
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
ahem ahem *cough* enlightened ahem *cough*
you hate this place flubs
fleshlight
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
coffee drinker
that's the smell of nature, you fool
even the decent ones are just not realistic
how much in total?
i kind of gave up once i realized i'm the ranger and ranged weapons drop my fps to shit
i love collosseum and gale of darkness
it just might overhaul though.
that's a good idea.
sounds interesting
i used mainly jgrasp.
they charge money for use of the mods content.
sorry.
how'd you even get it?
ehh effort
so if i had to guess
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
i made a thing
reee
nothing happen to me
save the portal for next time
and i’m not learning anything except how to be really lazy 😛
good to hear
currently alone in a very empty quiet hallway
never watched the emoji movie before
college
2 was meh
is because disney owns them
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
yes rc go ahead with the snarky
more than you
label?
i’m still not there...
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
my sister has noticed that i have weird friends
that's what i'm currently doing, anyway.
your feet
yeah me trying to pogo myself onto my desk using one hand
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
e!will
also insane
making flubs regret having faith in humanity, you can do quite well
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?
seriously my cabinets have chips and other snacks, my drawers have cookies and other desserts, and my shelves have high quality spices
idk why my classmates made a big deal about it
i watched the trailer
i can't find my stress ball
it's not a kingcorphish repeat
so asshole was an asshole, huh?
i have like 0 friends irl and im 100% ok with it because irl people are weird
if you got money yes
well from what ive heard if youve played hgss you havent missed much
i’m at my nephew’s 3rd birthday party and there’s several kids. i feel like running into a wall
crystal is my favorite game in the series
kappa
also, he has 7 pokemon
a rydon
oh but dont let me stop you from streaming every minute of every day for the rest of time
i have to leave the room before i start yelling at him or worse
also, it felt like they were changing things just to change things
also, nice zeke pic
you are not, you delusional bird
i guess they're giving them another chance since this was a one time thing
it's a loot magnet from luiafk.
whos to say i wasnt born in 1700 though
what are you going to do
something happen?
it isnt important. but damn that is not a safe for work photo
anything else?
11k gold in the bank
okay cya guys tuesday
no you....
she was having a nervous smile
this clip is a very low standard for both faith and a very high standard for humanity
so all the other consoles and pc can play together
why is there an actual currency based on garlic bread
like that?
how the hell did you get that
garlicoin, actually
i really question the use of math sometimes
i'm not going to be using this crap anytime soon
because i'd like math to teach me the practical aspects of it, and then have something else give me critical thinking skills
you're gonna need to be using problemsolving
but im not about to fucking wall mount a third
i have tons
what is with all of the icons
they weren't stupid enough to not learn from their mistake tho
so you are all time travellers?
and cadance we already have gummy we don't need more ponnies
y'all just hatin
is rarity an old lady confirmed?
"there's no reason to quote me"
cs4 might've been the latest version i used
no you aren't
im 5 11 but have tiny hands and feet
what is spelling
i'm guessing a lot
i just wear shoes bigger than my foot
my parents dont know what patreon is and that';s probably a good thing
i can't stand that stuff
i know, with the money i have, if i had to start paying rent and other payments, i wouldn’t have any left
i need to go do homework and discord is too distracting
i was responding to stuck's last message to me
urgh, i should sleep too. but this is the first time ive gotten to write real code in a few days and i'm trying to fight the withdrawal
brb screen break
squid just dont believe in it
that’s not a lot
enlightened has right to read message history, but i'll give him earthbound just in case to avoid this in the future
get to it
it's not too big a deal just annoying
because i know for sure no one will get it right, even flubs
if things end up going to hell when you and cadance have that chat, then i'll just pin it on dragonite
greetings, cadance.
if mr cadance ever asks me again why i like rarity, i got a list.
may 29
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
...what?
shockwave flash rarity?
i see someone tried to murder squid again
🎉 or 😱
yay guys
drago is the winner
more?
just the next 20 billion hours
computer

no its 8:01
i always read "defaced" as "defacated"
tell me
sounds delightful
hey guys i have an idea
like
or maybe it was alyssa
mine would be a remix of nuclear fusion.
how about, god save everyone else because we're going to need it
i was expecting skyrim but ok drago
botw, the yiga clan hideout in gerudo
no he does not
its not like exp decays
the windows 10 hard drive wants to confirm alll the integrity stuff, exactly as expected
then again i prefer this purple
my gpu is 80 degrees c but the case is freaking freezing
oh no im not brave enough for politics
fuckit im gonna try it
so its micspam time. got it.

46% scanned
mine are best
all the garlic
but like...its gonna get hot. and when its hot its loud

actually, going to her concert in a couple months 😄
e!ida

e!back
herhaps.
i'm still in pre-hardmode xp
so, has everyone had a better day than me?
if you wanna cover your tracks besides aren you should not be friends with your main account
i can't find the one i knew about
yeah, we do
but yeah im done finals and stuff
i'm not going to be held responsible for the death of the bot
some previous test subjects have been able to. others not so much
it reminded me of you
damn it
what the hay
"the funeral is at 6:00, please be on time"ypoo
too late
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
i kinda am
my real name is boring
besides that dude from pokemon
doesnt help me figure out who tf owns the discord beta testing server tho

well ida we are nice siblings
great now i have self-confidence issues
owo this is interesting
im soon gonna start dumping a lot of my stuff onto the pentium that we have and is like 80% empty of a 1 tb
maybe it was like a proto-proto-proto-proto-proto-proto phonograph and they just slapped on the video later
into everything...
"genious"
hey gummy want to do my physics homework
real white chocolate chip muffins are chocolate muffins with white chocolate chips inside
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
but when you type `main` in with a capital m you need to manually input {} later on for your code to run
i want a muffin
not entirely sure why that needed to be pinned
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
you need a 3ds and money
so what it’s my part
i dont want those nsfw ones tho
a pint is a good "i have 10 minutes and feel like destroying myself" snack
that was her ice cream
you have a lot of liquid nitrogen
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
mmmmmm the ground
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
i don't want there to be too much lag
nice
👋 bye bye overhaul i never want to see you again
not even kidding.
i consider is a quality of life mod
can't too tired
yeah i was wondering before when you first said it
yea, i'll do my best to design the base better this time.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
how about that weather?!
eew gross why do you have poewrpoint and onenote pinned
<:lul:305559915714576385>

most of this quarter's assignments were about an event based on floating marbles on tin foil
fibus lusec wecos vinosec

this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
its a sword, how can it fit into a little hard drive?
not that wand, ,flubs
well i already say muskets anyways so i choose darling of course
i’m not uploading to twitch anytime soon, so it doesn’t bother me
i also get my ass beat my the main villain in the final battle

even with a job
they're just going back and forth with this
you already do, ninny
doing well.
do you think ida hates me?
*pokes gummy with a stick* xd
probably could but this dress is expensive
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
my intro is pretty good
stuck why would ida do that to me?
i mean boo
i didn’t buy it
lapel
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
yay the plushie empire is now the sharing lewd pics empire

skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
"greater masa mune" was the purple override.
what game is it?
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
yep just heard my dad freak out about it lmao
guess i am a female
~~what if you don't know what race you want to choose, wolve?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
adventurous
a bit of both?
no its a color
even if he was a melee guy during the mage quests
still due
dammit (follower name here)
i just smashed him since my first character was built to kill mages
i don't really have any followers tbh lol
he's trying to get in my ear
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
it's fun
being an administrator isn't easy at all.
plz repeat stuff
they let you on phones last year in spare
same
plus a server which is connected to the dm
knew that was going to happen
a group dm ida
my catchphrase is better
ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
nvm just throwing it on the spreadsheet
that's not good news
pot meet kettle, gummy
or twenty
i never guilt trip you
did i just walk in on something here
6 questions
reminds me of myself
it’s annoying to the bot that animal man is a guy?
notice the "man"
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
i'd say around 3.28
i might end up leaving
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
i eat babies
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
at this point, i'd just let them tear each other to pieces. if it's being straining to your health, it's probably the better initiative to leave
no no lets
but drama is fuuunnnnn
goood gummy
or pregnant luigi
i wanted to be blue :c
the adage is "half your age plus seven"
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
but until that day
the bot is taunting me
okay jumbalaya
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
im no friend of his
never most likely
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
how goes things?
let me guess: same person?
officers!
um thanks rainy
it takes a lot most to understand, but you have much more control over what things do.
they’re well. just waiting  to get to my stop for the subway
how are you?
because flubs is more fun
`private final boolean masterisabutthead=true;`
partnership for peace?
i'm not fun
darn i thought it was genetic
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
oh, and there's also the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by the means of books.
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enforce strict equality throughout the entire source code.
and that too
could be worse rares
i had one once
it was at first
wow before premiere it had quality options
keyword: should
irl, i have no patience
i will never understand why anyone like it. unless you are a poison type lover
wasted over 10 hours reuploading episode 11
anyone here have a good recipe for pizza sauce?
i think i am seeing things
i think ida doesn’t like me now 😛
probably but gummy is known for being solo and lonely
ida what else do you thinki do that’s a waste of time?
not that one
no one talks to him
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
e!censor-remove kaiser
great suspended turned out to just feel annoying for me
why's that?
chrome
banked garlic bread from ~~scratch~~ raw ingredients
dazzling is next at school then
kaiser
doesnt mean he cant react with them
every kind of doughnut violently smashed into one megadonut > all alternatives
btw i told her what you told me flubs
love being the hypocrite here
i thought it was fairly obvious :c
heh heh
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
youre still weird though
brb looking up how many joules are spent in an hour long bike ride at fifteen mph
i reset the game
programmer art sound effects

youtube/twitch
who else refers me as rarity here?
whelp.
archive them somewhere or something
you think we should hold off for updates?
im allerguc
i’m nit picking probably haha
close
your advice worked
you didn't ask for a good explanation
in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
same person, gummy?
also kicking the creator of the bot on that server isn’t a good idea as well
no squid that’s inappropriate
welcome to zeal simulator 12kbby
use sylveon lol
gummy can you nickname a pokémon after me
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
drago loves me squid
said you were
and they want to outplay inflation in profits i think
i gave flubs rice with vinegar
no 5th supergummying youtube anniversary
no dont expect nothing. expect idiocy and explosions.
ironically, the first time i watched basketball was the 2004 olympics where the us team lost <:lul:305559915714576385>
until you quit this server?
and hey you have bad apple yay
i guess i missed the part where dragonite's name was changed to 'screw you master - guru of screw'
ahh starting week count on monday

i like the diving events too
all the mods are gone
drago

i know rc thats why nothing bad should happen
im too busy trying to sing chant du départ
what? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
well it’s an impacted major
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
time to scramble
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
not the greatest.
i just checked and i think it’s getting close to 20 more
everything alright?
him and mal (his wife) do show up in the discord server quite a bit; at least one of them, once a day
i've seen that one.
whelp.
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i somehow win despite not being in any part of this.
<:treason:396483914803445761>
doit
and thumbs up had its own glitch
“prick”
i didn’t. although i was feeling slightly more upbeat today
okay then
i thought it was all in good fun but it was actually meant for me to feel bad
i already promise not to have a huge freakout ever since the october 8th 2016 at 7pm incident
fuck you too
i have crystal and there is a reason why they made remakes
same
my temper is bad though, i will freak out
theres customization options on the page but you can sub in more stuff later on if you want
such a rare find
asus
ill throw one ultra ball
why did nintendo do a poor job on vc emulation?
maybe flubs but i know how to handle most of the situation
i do plan on catching legendaries in unorthodox balls when i get to usum
are baconators actual things
what do you guys feel about randomizers
can i get ban so i don't have to jump back and forth to different servers?
ah man i love hidden items finding to found it its a fucking x-speical
i mean he's practically banned from this server anyways
-31 here
rc that is called driving
you didn’t have to do that
i can wear that and shake my tail
like by definition
i need something to fit me and shake your tail fits me well
conflict?
it just has this charm to me i don’t know
my dogs are sleeping and im so jealous because i want to catch up on some more sleep as well
i could have done 1804 or 1815
what kind is it?
yes it was dumb bird
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
now it feels like the bot is being sarcastic
<:lul:305559915714576385>
there's another good response
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
oh that makes sense
welcome back, aqua.
i am
ahem
nope
when i wake up its a blank slate of "~~where am i to go me johnies~~ no idea what to do today"
they are?
and i don't wanna do a sidebox
kk cya
sleep is for the weak.
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=
that would be funny in real life though. "oh i cant walk because of those 4 swords longer than my arm strapped to my back. forgot about those.
that is ok
how do you drink pie?
that... doesn't answer our question.
no kill me
lmao theyve all been taken over by the hawaii missile warning thing
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
the guards right?
what’s life? isn’t it a game? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
all music is bad, so yes.
we need a quarantine
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>

funny how my jerk friend is on my side for this one
welcome. have a baconator 🍔
seen the escape rope fail yet?
i said me, you ninny
i’m thinking of james’s bottle cap collection (guy from pokemon)
oops caps
all caps are great
namely, her.e
this is what i look like
also a few milling subscribers and a thriving youtube channel but that's beside the point.
whenever people ask me whether they should do this or that in a video game i know nothing about, i tell them to "follow your heart" works every time <:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
i’m not drinking anything
what was i being thanked for
wow, grade a english on my part
oh man we're havin' steak for dinner <:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>

well don't throw up in here
i should probably leave, class has started.
\the adventure one is sfw
funny how a jerk friend tried to convince i really was a lady and that my brain was telling me i wasn’t
explanation please
i think it might be for the upcoming underground boss
i don’t speak in cursive
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
wait shit i firgot to approve all these first
so gummy doesn’t know how to fix things apparently
yup who knew making a group chat was so hard...
pick a vacation area i should go to
frickin captain colours sounds better than that
the battle is starting soon
sonanoka~
~~cut it off to spare the pain~~
i see.
so many scottish accented voices shouting "think you can take me?" in my head right now, this is normal
theres a few good ones tho
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
it sucks you in, i know that from experience
someone help
that sounds stupid
no but can we talk about the non food pancakes. theyre better
waffles
i can't
my throat now really hurts
actually better than what you called me yesterday
i spent most of my time on the internet on cartoon network and nickelodeon’s websites
at least make an effort lol
idk if i actually ever bear it or not
i can’t stay up for 24 hours
are you texting and driving, first of all
dude
<:lul:305559915714576385>
not a name i recognize
well, apparently, i’ve made a couple people upset in another server for having not-positive opinions on things
<:hellothere:305560404715896832> dan
what happened?
live footage of eyan deleting friends
i dont even remember posting that
not a fan of steak either
i mean where did you find the news?
wow i am not ban in his twitch chat
i don’t see the appeal of bacon
i don't see anything wrong with pineapple
nice
i wouldn't willingly order it
rip lines
you starting to suffer from sleep apnea?
does that mean the student lives in the regular school building now or???
like at all
like overall student's eoc scores raised by like 7%
i thought you were homeschooled though
strem

it is beyond my comprehension how someone doesnt like salmon roll
lunch with the kaiser!
live is a cross between like and love
worth
e!dragonite-b
that good?
well the "ryzen 1600" is specifically the cpu of said computer.
awua
raw fish?
i mean there's probably a way to program the bot to remove reaction if it was added by someone else
because i remember there was one point that eyan was trying to be a summoner and was looking for a slime staff.
gummy prefers green?
i question how effective that solution is
pay eyan $5 and that'll be a yes
<:treason:396483914803445761>
you have to look really close and cross your eyes and poke yourself in the face with the arrow tip
enhanse
idk about htat one
and that’s not green
never thought i would see this day
over yours and corphish's dead bodies
im talking to her ex bestie
i've always gone for water starts on my first playthroughs.

i was only 1 then
that went well
well go do it then, i'm too lazy to do it
sup nerds
you dying?
okay, because that previous message confused me
are you telling flubs that's the decision you made that he won't agree with
does that kill
because i'm busy doing other shit
chicken pox?
<:coolstorybob:327305348698603520>
because it's not

brb doing garlic bread cinematography
things go brilliant today
also on the subject of ports secret of mana just got a steam remake, anyone know if it's any good? (it's getting pilloried by the reviews)
well i get it
but if it wasn't. i would totally buy it
(late)
oh...
whyd you do that
a crane
i wouldve
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
"hey!"
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
for chrome?
i also like just drunk ideas in general
and no, mother 3 is not confirmed
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
wait i havent added taht
<:pcmr:305892755014418435>
i have a windbreaker, warm af sweater, long sleeve, and short sleeve shirt all on rn and i just got out of the gym
good mentality
each word drawn from a list of ~1 million
it is
there are 9 words per sentence
don't feel like changing that anyway
hai everyone <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
that wasn't a pun
and then all the frogs float into space <:kappa:374346980136058893>
ack, didn't copy.
<:doit:334014889137930240>
or alternatively: looking at the abyss
skarm, no.
they're glitchy

whomst
oh darn i missed a stream
dayum
possibly
good
again, are we dealing with the bot or gummy at this point
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
xcom
cosmic chicken
thinking like a game designer
it's been fantastic
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
oh i didn’t mean it like that
i'd pay money to ban this entire server just because i enjoy anarchy
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
honestly i kinda believe andi would do something crazy like this
from what i heard, she was a no-show sunday. she first called and said she couldn’t work, she got a court summons. but, the supervisor who answered the call called her out and said that the courts are closed on sunday
the end
~~are we eating chicken?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
what are we preparing it for?
not for another two months
but are we eating the chicken?
the date
i changed my mind
no, i’m string asquid = “squidofbaconator”;
im weird
a little bit of both i’d say
*burns snapchat* there was no use to that anyways
<:lul:305559915714576385>
master controls fibus
its a new record on the timer
iirc
okay was it the bot or the game that dragonite was referring to, in terms of the image.
attention citizens of zeal
time to ask everyone to follow me
i demand violence
flubs?
even talking about treason is treason
wrong person, damn you
i should get it, but again...lazy
you can stop with your pickup lines now
my bad wrong server
i said dragon, not dragonite
connection issues
it's just getting better and better.
x&y has always been hated
congrats
definitely
i need protection
gen ii is still my favorite.
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much
modulo.
i wanna get an inkay though
how do i hide channels again?
oh and fries get a free pass ofc
only thing i care to eat from there is their pancakes, hash browns, and parfaits
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
i approve. =w=
i am
i’ve only had sushi once in my life
that's not fun
oooo i love that song
i have the sudden urge to open bot dot js and fix all of master's lousy formatting decisions
because it works
this is true
pretty easy to find
i'll try to look for it in that shithole called weeb chat
it was funny
you never talk to me
just use a vacuum
that's my job
$60 and i only played it for 5 hours
why do you keep shoving things down my throat?
wait
maybe
yup master jinx me
star wars isnt my favorite thing
ech!
to have something in common: to share the same interests ~~or have similar characteristics~~
that’s blitz’s thing
woo, another computer issue solved.
this is a mutual despise of the others interests
until today
well today was a horrible day
is that the first action directed at wolverale, now
thats not something in common
i despise it but i don’t fully hate it
mystery dungeon explorers of sky is stupid
ok yeah thanks now leave
hg/ss is so expensive. a new copy is $799
i ordered two...
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
never said play it
not dying guys
hey will
did you see godzilla blow up the mailman?
skarm sound the drums of war.... japan is going down
a dog didn't explode the mailman though, a giant mutated lizard did
wait nvm he got caught more than once
is it part poodle part moth <:kappa:374346980136058893>
rest well then
get back here
maybe. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
*struggles*.... hmm
its a psychic scream
bahhhhh
time to level up
thank you
i mean you get to choose
it probably won't, but it also probably will
he said go minimalist on it so it probably isnt gonna make it
well to his credit, master. the third most recent announcement in blackomen *isnt* explicitly stating that
i don't think it's much to ask for a little respect via the honor system.
try getting on my level (14)
well
and getting up at noon
he won the biggest level up message war so far
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs
wait isnt it like a lot less than halfway though
i kind of don't hang out here anymore
well best girl
really
like
whos that
against sivir azir rakan
i just wanna re sub then sleep
i dont know how to respond
there are 3 of us
sometimes it takes 2 seconds other times its like half an hour
nice
yeah wolve do that if you value your time sanity or happiness
hey man turn that frown upside down
few days later and i just remembered how bad it is
it sounds interesting
i’ve been wanting to play emerald again. but, i’m not sure if i want to play with my copy or find a rom like sigma emerald or something
theres nothing in the bullet
but double team umbreon just murders
oh, maybe
i know right?
not even an error?
where's the 3rd guru?
those
though i don’t think you will give me a wand
yeah thanks
wh- oh. skarm is being punny again
the part i don't understand is the system of magic used in chrono trigger
skarm does not want battle revolution
colress is good
i can keep talking shit about gen 5 <:kappa:374346980136058893>
now let's try this gif
n is awesome
they bashed manechat all the time
everyone has trouble with ghetsis, i consider it probably the hardest fight in the series.
i don’t like ghestsis.
yup twitch support is on it
those are tasty things which in this scenario overrules important
just think about flavors of pasta
<:lul:305559915714576385>

smirking got me to level up 😃
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
why have you been doing that up to now?
but i play online, so i can’t pause
no skarm turn yourself in!
that took years to make
ask my brony friends
and they started asking me advice
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
you caught me
it's just my alt dont get excited
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
gossip leads to bulli
yay!
what drago said
dangit
i return with cake
also my asshole friend is on vacation
good job master (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
she plays a lot of characters besides twilight like timmy turner
i was never a true zealian
well if he constantly says he’s 11 and to leave him alone because he’s young but acts like 11
2am and still not tired
but er good thing all the lessons drago taught me flew out the other ear
okay, that was a lie
lol yup
botw > skyrim
i could go for some java
i hope i find someone someday who is extremely untidy and can't cook for shit

nintendo should make all the main pokémon games available on either the 3ds/wii u virtual console or if the switch ends up getting a virtual console
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
he lost that match
damn

he subbed in for flubs with the village burning thing
ok hi bot
....drago
i think
should i set the starting counter to like 2?
thank
get rekt
skarm knows all
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era
turns out, if the subs don’t watch x amount of videos as they come out, they just straight up don’t get notified of the video
but they are at war with me
something something ritual of the ancestor moth
inb4 it's a ragnarok drop
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
i try to have a 10-7 sleep schedule.
i just dont recall the mini character items being thorious
gummy how many times do i have to describe "go up the chain of command" to you
flubs calls a lot of people that rc
"manechat"?
i’d listen if i wasn’t in public
then have someone else do it
the "asshole" actually inform me what was happening
ok, who was the queen disguised as in the phantom menace?
steven stone is just as physically attractive
whoops
yeah that’s how you spell it
im hungry
panda sneaking around
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
correct.

how so?
i'm still not sure if i would want to join or not.
alright. i’ll pm you mine
you get to see kangaroos though
the best thing i can make is a first rate ship
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
darn! how dare that country actually defend themselves!
greetings, bella.
remember screw the brits, screw the danes, and fuck prussia

now what?
i’m going to burn britain down

they would be the best of friends
i love it when someone babysits me
mo but that has happened
you know that website that majestic sent you a while ago?
and theoretically you cant trick your brain to be happy but you can force it to be
gummy, just tell an agent that you are a terrorist, then  you won't be going anywhere
an artist must work in the shadows to serve the light

also i love how i say women take forever as my pfp literally shows that...
<:lul:305559915714576385>

two wine glass
nice
mm'hmm
yes...our tour guide
ha, it's right off of oak lane
best 8 hours of the day
it's better than megashark but consumes more ammo
on it.
i just found out about that
dessert
actually, is it just rng farming? cause that's fine
i never experienced the celebi event first hand because my parents didn't want to leave the house the day i wanted to go to gamestop to get it because it was raining
even a lot of people who don't like gen 5 like n
i feel like most of the games since the beginning of gen 6 are rushed
depends on the weekday
i love gossiping for some reason
~~and lags you if you don't have a good pc.~~
halfway to reddd
how did i know that would get pinned? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i assume for the video-game variety?
need a one word synonym for controller
be nice to the coffee machine skarm
holy fuck everything in switzerland is expensive
guys how long do you think before he gets to the good part?
girl underwear drago
i think that's a record

gotta love free destruction level ups
whats the level cap in skyrim?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
here's what i know regarding those 3 distros.
e!react 431604943464693761 👍

felt like touhou on like, normal-to-hard
quiet you
test
sarah ghome food in mouth yay
i am so confused
for the stream playthrough?
it must have been tough adjusting to the time difference
crashed again.
no flubs
oooh its a party in commons
dammit skarm
i almost said detonator but thats silly the detonator is in the bomb
also holy crap youtube's autoplay algorithm is like 5 billion times better than their shuffle playlist one
why are they a thing?
you lack the required spacing
did you see drago?
and i already saw it a couple times. i am subscribed to him <:kappa:374346980136058893>
all implies everyone's
i would go
the quest should still be in your to do list tho
they give you other buffs
isnt alduin really easy to kill though
so must make an anthem
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
she insinuated some very rude things about my ancestors being related
like...everyone knows the people all die so who gives a fuck
a lot of things
and took the free money
im not looking for ping time
they have a food about it
at least it kept recording
i thought you could just type throw error into a function?
my league client has failed catastrophically
good job

which is a shame, means i missed out on pizza delivery sivir
okay, that's kinda great.
hey, i was going to eat that squid
do you have food
so it's a name pun.
wolve, you're a grnius.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
:feelsannoyingman:
point goes to wolveale.
from shadows of almia.
uh oh.
plus, you can’t take pokémon out of certain areas until post game. and the 2nd and 3rd games have side quests
my team in platinum was infernape, abomasnow, floatzel, dragonite, and...  i don't remember what else i used since it's been years.
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
just make bidoof the best pokémon ever <:kappa:374346980136058893>
oh, he used a buizel.
*sees new pin* <:lul:305559915714576385>
later, squid.
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
wowsa.
boring
or just a generic outage?
and it uses jpeg images
its a collage of 3 images one of them being negated and all of them being mirrored diagonally
yeah
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
i used excadrill in my black playthrough and i was quite happy with its performance.
terraria: a game a lot of people play that i have no interest in <:kappa:374346980136058893>
you mean loot cubes with a mob spawner?
it's the perfect pink nu quote
i got a really good paxel and scepter.
now that that's over with, can i wipe my rank and start over?
ebony warrior
because they feel like it
was there 8 of them? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i died for the xth time. good thing i have plenty of max revives that can’t be destroyed or taken away from me
by the way, wolve.
oh god, he's lost it
(though i'll admit i hated the art style, for some reason)
i vote option a.
remember kids, always make the best use of your situation
and we're done
same, how do you think i got lvl 90 lul
it's mostly cats playing musical instruments
oh yeah another great thing about the db
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
but does a tough battle make a good character?
shadowmere
i had to take it off because it felt like i was eating a sloppy joe
please dont blow up dan
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
my soul is an eye
like...its either liking an early gen or hating all early gens for not being new enough
that works too i suppose
point to a direction
hey thats what i heard
wrong answer
oooh sounds tasty
i mean i never talk there either, but it seems like a friendly community
feelsfrogman
my word against yours
these are dark magic bombs
wait what the fuck theres a bards college in skyrim
plus daedric hand
remember, im pushing for the skyrim/prequel meme crossovers
nice
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
while im trying to also work on another monitor
in black/white, i went back to nimbasa to fight the trains there all the time.
now i just need to come up with good designs for it
firered omega (at least the version i have) doesn't back-implement mechanics.
nice giratina icon
im just saying i like seeing them clearly
master, are we going to have a single house for the npcs or several houses that we build up over time?
anime titties
this again?
(i'm not really, i just hate the taste)
yeah you definitely know when you got it
you can narrow down the suspects
thiccccc
i think we’re talking about this because i mentioned not feeling well
mr meatball nose
that changes nothing
i was about to say and you thought diver was good
the fork is a weapon. it deals 1 damage and cant be boosted.
yay i got occlusion culling to work
"if it ain't broke, don't skittying fix it"
work is never fun
solstheim
ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow
correction: if had some entertaining features in the netcode
and all of a sudden, i feel tired...
activate work sleep
i just got back from work
i know the feeling ida
that's what i thought
and no
oh then that's your fault
good, it's working
what story
that's very generous
im waiting for the good part which im assured is coming
oh dear
i am the department of health
the ocean one?
i never play competitive games though, i've always been a solo player
like what?
i’m back from work ya ninnies
welp guess ill go kill alduin for the first time
and i don’t know why, but my phone battery was going down really fast today. it was at 3% when i got home. it never gets down that low
after a while phone batteries just shit themselves for some reason
im confused now
shoving off to sleep, was nice knowing you, etc, dont burn the place down, etc, etc, etc
unless his discord username is different now.
too bad this is fireproofprooffire
i've actually started using items less since i've gotten better at the game.
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
100% oj, 2d game.
and now im gonna feel like an asshole when it turns out he had a perfectly valid reason not to come in
step 1: open the computer
reminds me a little of world of final fantasy with the chibi-like characters.
ughh, i have to do bleak falls barrow to do the civil war?
fucking bullshit
and it's causing hadvar to skip around helgen
no you just have to do bleak falls barrow
argonian?
it was only 2 feet deep
what are you playing? emerald?
you got it
thats how high up we are
i feel like my eyes have been opened
yes but why
because that sounds violent
tell the physics gnomes to stop fucking around
you ate some thing edible
doesn't hurt that dragoon has like always been my favourite ff class
yea.
they suck
could you imagine doing a group playthrough on medium core?
avicii was just found dead
seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
there's a thing called raids going on blade and soul
never got into him myself but yeah
this dude
*shrug* the instructions said not to

butter luck next time
is it bad that i can only assume that's m.website programming?
it deletes a quarter of its messages when  there are more than 8k messages
i don't think you can get a dump of ios.
no, that is incorrect
i know
this is healthy
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
someone enlighten me on how that qualifies as a "meme"
guts cancels it out.
sounds good
defuq does that mean
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
i had a few gold.
it's similar to fargo's but it allows you to summon minibosses and rare enemies like the lost girl.
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
well i found my 5 weapons to go for in pre-hardmode.
i dont see why not
except cenx's set
ehh, i'll just grab everything useful and we can sort out rules on friday
the amazon?
ahh, i get that from eyan
you idiot
until next time, gentlemen.
thank
reaver shark
good luck with that
hmmm
which had explosives in it
list all the methods of lcass corpus
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
why wouldn't i?
thank you kind sir
okay anyway im sleep now
lol, got a clam cane farming for sea stars
save the flubsing the place down for flubs
good job
well i like luigi for reasons other than dabbing
play some portal two. theres a part in there where he kills you.
you kidding me? i just screenshot each individual frame, paste them onto powerpoint slides, and program the slide show to go through 30 slides each second
moviemaker[][]
good job
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
movie maker is nice
speaking of video editing, i should edit video
i like potatoes. do you like potatoes?
but i don't feel like editing video
no you just havent caught up with death yet
although i broke that trend.
do i get another trophy for level 60?
you fit right in here. =w=
won't have to do those things for another year
just the one.
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
there's a bit of a bug with marisa and alice.
that*
deriving matrices ??
oh wow really? i heard some can solve equations on their own and stuff
oh nice
who downvoted that
we didnt do much abs in precalc
and by recently i mean a few months ago
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
the formula was n² + n - 1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
why are we talking about trees now
hang on
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
so you have to type in (-1)^4
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
that is new
not a full clear though.
i don't bother leaving comments cause i'm afraid people will come after me
assholes need lessons taught to them
so clearly he knew he screwed up
he made me face palm so hard
yea, fun fact i never named my chanel after him, i was trying to be original but still naming myself after something related to space
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
or given my personal rating
yeah that one's super hard
hotball1 is, to date, the only person who's ever beaten bloodbath on 60hz
the nightmare was hard demon at one point
hotball is undoubtedly the best in the world right now
i started acropolis when it was #45
wait
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
looks like java doesn't care master lul
half of my class dropped out thinking it was too hard in bluej
how would you plug that in?
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
scishow did a video on them a while ago
youre lewd
like 2.3 sneak peek?
apparently cosmic cyclone was cancelled
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
alright, cya have fun
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
they were poisoned
because the projectile starts on the other side of them
you know
lets get some bagels my friends
with a very big appetite
the bagel song

well it is double spaced so that works
fuck
wtf is max()
i can prove its dark magic and have you burned at the stake
sure
yeah you're michael faraday or something
except the mets lost
where the skitty do you find a ten dollar mouse
also my computer just rebooted without explanation

ok that really hurt so imma go die brb

i got it on ebay lol
greetings, and salutations, sky.  welcome to the kingdom of zeal.

the senate suplex.
he threatened me with sending me off to a potato farm when i told him to think before doing something stupid
flubs i'll buy one of those tow truck cart things and attach it to the back of my bike
good morning
ah lol nice ^w^
sounds devastating

 - say youre going afk to do important things and to ping you if it's urgent
here lies dragonite
from our activity levels, yes quite obviously
｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
if it makes you feel any better i can go in and lower the frequency of puns
1 stands for "execute", and
and noice skarm
2 stands for "write",
like im decked out in hellstone gear, i just need a muramasa so i can craft nights edge

1. something happened and i got booted out of character creation before i was done.
85 is perfect

anyway, are you free to try it at like 6 today?
can i just put dog as background and then take picture of computer background and then email the background to a test ipad at apple and then email off of that to a bank so they can print it on the back of checks?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i could get work done
oh wait no thats just the weather balloon thats on fire. the sky isnt on fire
but hes made of alcohol
ateveryone who here's life isnt a dumpster fire?
that's slightly cheaper than my car
problem solved
ok, i got to sleep now
at least he didnt lose it
oh wait
~~greetings and salutations, gummy! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!~~
wait hold the phone
gummy record a xenoblade chronicles lets play
gummy can i be your best friend
how did the count rise to 5 tho?
oops
gummy you forgot the part where flubs and i set fire to things
that'll be refreshing
that sounds even worse
i mean we've known about it for almost a year so i would hope there's something
and i have the one thats just a shell with kenobi's face on it
that wont wake her
can i have one
gummy run
poo is stupid and i hate it
3 weeks minimum
flubs
>ida has been playing skyrim for 5 hours

in the 3ds version sarah keeps beating me as jigglypuff
how do i delete this shit
but i want to play with libgdx
and become what you tried to escape
ice cream and brownies are the greatest things i've had in awhile
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
you have a symptom known as fear of snakes disorder
just finished physics class
before what?
i remember scratch
looks like you've hoiked yourself into a wall.
chocolate chip would just mean generally anything that isnt vanilla
what ~~class and weapon~~ bow do you have?
nice
dated dec 2, 2011
we used it in intro
public class dragonite{
gummy arent you the one with the super fancy gaming pc
arent sata cables generally easy to get a hold of though?
ow and also my back
3 plz
that doesnt make you any more sane
mu is a pokemon
*kinda*?
now do it recursivley
yeah close enough on the zeroes
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
no please my brother help
oh no you dont
why are you giving a math lesson to flubs? and flubs, it’s “mew”
i blame the english majors for making a shitty api
```
when was i supposed to learn this shit
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
fun conversation. now to figure out why rotating the camera turns the world upside down.
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
you gotta do so much to make them not gross
as opposed to the double-precision one
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue
im back.
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
it's great
yes, but then the trash will return and still need to be taken out
28 left
that chaos!
“press f for lamp”
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity
blazblue, why do i know that name . . .
and then went rogue.
<:lul:305559915714576385>
no. i dont even know what you gain from playing expert
it's much easier to keep track of.
i’d do it if i felt well
ah hah
and the boss health bar.
oh no
i'm was never hired
i was, but it passed.
oh great!
in a text bubble.
happy revenge of the 5th everyone <:kappa:374346980136058893> is that even a thing? my friend who loves star wars said that so it must be, it oughta be.
whelp.
this has probably been the best stream (counting yesterday) i have ever been to
make that 3 more.
probably shouldn’t have sat on him...
"don't get me wrong, i love lamp".
what do you mean no. im like 90% sure hes my dog
final fantasy xv
he’s my dog now
20 secs to load pc
never timed it though
anyone else wanna learn?
this is still going?
master would be proud.
i’m here in time for splatoon 2, whenever they stop playing this game
try and launch your worm as far as possible
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
"worms: worms must die" indeed. o_o
hands down.
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
figured i owe it to them
thats me, baby
100k!
excluding this ```java
eat it
private static final char m = 'm';
i’m starting to believe i actually have multi personality disorder and it’s affecting my friends
because discord devs are busy transfering the system over to a new something or other
wanna try it
dragonite.debts.master.owe = 0;
java framework for making video games
sudo make me a sandwich
```access to kitchen object denied```
im bored and class has yet to start. someone do something.
what were the questions?
sooo yay
he was saving it for a party tonight
do teachers know
or is that our supply of kiwalas
i don’t he will even get suspended
i have no opinion i am romantically involved with a weakling
not that
yeah either way it's messed up
correct.
i’m back from work ya ninnies
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
while also dressed in a modded chicken suit
my three month old mouse is having switch issues and keeps double clicking, fuck you logitech
it’s funny how you run, as it’s very distinctive, and i never said you were the cause of the loss
so when does google make a nation and we end up in some dystopia where they own everyone
it seems we are at an impasse
my tavernkeep in terraria is named blacksmith
do you what?
otherwise known as confetti gun fights
i love this
or something like that
for once you didn’t collapse something
oh grad party will be safe
mmmh
well yeah
it’s fun
and only assholes do that
i’m back from work ya ninnies
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
how so?
btw thats what the college catalog says^
i think that was just a general statement
unsigned bytes, rather
i've been a pretty diehard fan of far cry for a while
hahaha
so you do want to knowm
now the teacher walked in and he's talking about civ or something with one of the classmates
    }
thats asshole though right
thats true, maybe we'll get a gtavi within ten years then
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
but rdr2 is on the horizon so they're gonna swap ~~cash cows~~ games
i only have ever hugged you and ida in this server
because only high quality shitposts make it through
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
shhhh
i kinda wanna frame it
nah rainy they were being crazy amount of bitch
it's misty freaking out
it's 1:30 in the morning and i'm documenting my code
what do you think?
i'm not your guy, buddy
niht
fuck
no, square the temperature
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
then you are safe
ive never thought about it
as long as eyan doesn't have startup issues
when a hazel and another hazel love each other very much
backward is not an option
reverse reverse
it's quite obviously flubs going in to ensure gummy trying to reunify everyone for the 4th era doesn't go south
both
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
what should you do if you accidentally got a magnet stuck inside your pc case
terrible rotator cuffs
yeah im not dead yet
and when's that?
and remember the left hand rule
uhuh
go faster than camera take picture
you use these words
something about technicians
the flash
yeah, i think that’s important
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
what here needs modifying?
* what went wrong:
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
and a keyboard
did some cable management and how at 100 mbps
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
slow clap
wanna make games with me and master?
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
lol bob the builder
tell the friend to make games too
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
you dont have it still?
i woke up at 6:30 for an ap exam
im a doof
real java meaning notepad++ and cmd/
if you go the long way instead of just using the formula theres like 80 points of fuckupability
i cant remember how it works now though
welp
3+4=5
i think 5-24-25 is also one
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
it's not
i like casios but the rest of the planet likes the texas instrument
oh gorsh
same
why?
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
hey bella
im just not gonna show up
proudspire manor is a nice house...
so far operation: one small thing is falling apart probably because it was a dumb idea
it was thanks to war that got me in this mess
i know
yeah we know
idk who to pick though
sometimes relationships just take time to heal, other times it may be for the best that they never do
and year 2 fall
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>, squid
the only gold level tool you really need is the pick.
as the game has no ending
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
watering can upgrades are the surprisingly nice ones tho
like doubling numbers
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
damn
theres those junimo huts you can get
it's not like the class is experimental
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
its honestly luck of the draw
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
and those varieties being longer means theres more to put in there
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
why are you upvoting
my social interaction is with idiot customers at work
so no upset for you
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
and ok coworkers
it was funny to watch though
spoilers: everyone *except* jesus dies
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
yaya
since we have graduation first because they don’t want kids to worry about finals and grad at the same time
oh nvm he's playing empire lol
~~phanpy.~~
and the bed
only one way to find out
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
stahp
i can and will suck a duck
because im a chivalrous gentlemen or some other bullshit sale pitch she used
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
~~three~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it was only 20%?

>_>;
2,000 feet minimum.

i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
windows 3.1
<:lul:305559915714576385>
nah that cant be it
so tonight i finally get to relax with empire
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
we're gonna need to insert some metal kidneys
electric cars are the future
wait until battery technology improves ida
way less pollution
i can truly live in the 18th century now

i hope youre charging them rent
man i love empire total war
yeah i know
we talked about the art of history
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
i want some more twisted ice tea
also met a new friend at the party
gummy alcoholic confirmed
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
gummy said ‘go screw yourself’ then smiled a little
she is the only friend i made cry
well i’m going to let my friend text soon
and gummy's friend seems a little bit degrading, is there anything else that you'd rather have us call you?
that was exciting
$1.26 a liter
get one for everyone here too
obviously
perfect
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
what the skitty it's full of dog treats
oh thats benny's
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
i forgot my wallet and came home
the grad date was yesterday though
i paid him
unless you changed it
did the censor not work?
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
smart bois
slow clap
go for it
is it all private?
people
go with 1 to not fall into their r/fellowkids shit
yall can laugh but i legit had a job in a lab one summer that involved an instrument called a "penetration penetroometer"
oh yeah gummy
my final english grade is 96% :v
especially for the books where your teacher has read them and interpreted them differently than you.
people just sub
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
blugh people are annoying
i didnt like those computerized tests
i mean i've tried interfaces first hand and that explanation still doesn't help anything make sense
what is condom snorting
you need to plug them into the coaxial outlet with the xlr switch enabled
it's treason
there's at least two in my colossal cave adventure knockoff that i sent you a few days ago
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
check for "this is a prank" on the lottery token
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
no i thought i won...but i was literally on off...
now i want a drink
it’s legit
you cant snort a condom
god i ate so much cheese today...yesterday
hi gummy ^w^
but im bad at that

ouo!
im just tired and wanting to play empire total war
<:lul:305559915714576385>

how do i suddenly have a phreak announcer pack
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
all im doing is pushing myself
i'll brb
well they still dont make sense
hmm, making xenoblade fan game is hard
the united states shall fall to the french republic
that sounds a lot easier
72 gb of game maker cache
tharsis
we know
i need help
though if i could i would
or something
melia+mythra>all
a game?
~~or you could just be yourself~~
no a server
well i accidentally invited my favourite mod to my new server
and suddenly it goes from cloudy to pouring in 5 seconds
ok next is the trumpet blaring from the sky
she’s super cute
no idea what that is
have fun
yeah
holy shit
time to play singleplayer games and not save
yep, weird
skyrim no save run
e gadd?
in other words, i spilled water on my keyboard and cleaned it off with my elbow
holy crap its almost six pm and nobodys done anything for dinner bye
that was fun

?0.0225"?m  
wrong, it was "brb food"
it is
i cant think of a time frame where thats a good idea
night
barf green with chunks.
no doubt
how many lurkers are there here?
what?
i guess you aren’t hungry
obviously
so you say
the following year students were not permitted to change the wallpaper
good luck with that
i like to take credit for that
bricks are soft. i thought he meant at least quartz.
normally zero
none of them are done well, however
camelot 2.0 is going well
so i have confidence that i'll qualify for the course
<:lul:305559915714576385>
gummy remind benny that im rooting for him
in javascript and game maker anyway
thanks you broke both my hands
in java decidedly not
nice
well i can't change it on mobile sooo x d
ouo!
<:gwcfcthonk:357907199928041473>
well it isn't
master have you looked at libgdx yet
yeah, i checked myslf after i was off by  like 0.1 or so
mfw i can take math126 and math127 both over the summer 😮
_shakes fist at the skyy
in theory: yes
in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
ok i have 40 minutes of photo transfers left to do
no probably going to copy paste chant du départ and change some words
whenever my (great?)grandparents were high schoolers
currently counting 435 photos
now you can use them for food preparation
~~tacos are too overrated to be in a national anthem~~
that sounds like the villain from splatoon 3
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
update: real life sucks. who wants to talk about video games?
that won't end well
1930s?
you people arent very good at this
(－‸ლ)
they don't curse in this movie but they changed words up
i keep seeing people spawning in with an obviously cheated in amount of coins
again?
the one about clocks or something
i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
try this
i am glad i changed a few words
oh fuck maybe
but yeah sing that song
fuck i’ll fix it on pc
<#305548986155008000> plz
could be
back to work
and awesome holidays
no bad apple
all the males with legs
im perfectly happy on my own
and also it makes me a better singer
so i think the year my mom hit 18 they upped it
also i needed the territory of egypt which was own by the ottoman empire at that time so instead of declaring war and taking it, i did it the ida way
i guess that makes sense
you heard the man gummy
your youth or your life as payment
sneak 100
that seems fair to me
i should sleep
but now i'm a higher enough rank than her that we can no longer play competitive together
no squid
squid you can be the guru of the gutter
rip lol
96% on my geometry final :v
no rainy
not from family but from my community
lol true
greetings, will.
seems about right
it's a great song though
and i only accidentally summoned wof twice
i switch between new saves and my main all in one
but let's be really nice about it so when he wakes up he doesn't feel any negative emotion about it
<:fat_think:330657519309422592>
so, is eyan dead or still asleep? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
hello

drago can i borrow $30?
you missed the dumpster

aurelion sol?
        });```

the dude who has a bone and the dude that is actually just his soul
sets their bones on fire
rii vah
the banished
i only explored like 30% of guar plains
that's probably because shadowplay doesn't record at like a terabit per second
you very much can, drago
ive only edited like fifteen or sixteen btw
i use 1080p60 for mine too but use shadowplay. stuffs a lot smaller
anything higher than 50 will probably be overkill
what does bitrate even change
idk what it is but it smells nice
your spleen hole is bleeding so much you must know something
oh like taco style of bowl?
she got me some fish bowl
the hell
stabbing someone isn’t nice <:fluttershyscared:447198814747492352>
good luck
my worst joke:
lasagna
or was some homeless guy hungry?
how many bits per second the thing uses to encode video
well you are new to me, so, salutations

custard is superior
wrong text field
just shot everyone
thinkingface
good enough
dude atma's + shoujin spear or whatever it is

idk how to do that in discord though
darn
i should probably do the same, night all
well, i think i got a cold or sinus infection or something. yesterday, i couldn’t stop coughing and today, my nose won’t stop running
on the subject of this school thing, i have made the executive decision as head of the gsa: gsa stands for gay shit ayylmao now
you wanna be part of gay shit ayylmao?
good news i have a way with words
nah, only requirement is that you laugh at a gay meme at some point
whatever floats your goat
oh boy i have to be proctored for a final in an hour and 20 minutes
except that one that rainy posted

either way works lol
oh, that's the bitch i get to stab, irght?
i missed the old me
at the very least i was lurking in here when you were talking about it <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
not as much
i hate algebra <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
i'm always hiding from someone <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
nice
at least that's why i don't
because it bothers you
thanks
yeah
can you ask her to let me finish my finals first
but if im being completely honest this science course was very good
yes rainy?
get sarah to beat him then
or drink yourself super sick and use that miserable morning as fuel to be sparing
were you just gonna uber everywhere? <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
also hot coffee on a winter morning is the only reason i'm not 100% atheist
why not
gas is expensive btw
i just like autumn because i get to wear all of my favourite clothing <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
thank you!
and my allergies got really bad
but im playing games and stuff right now
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
i still can take the inverse of functions and boring stuff like that
why not
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if you know what that means
im taking two english classes this summer so yes i am quite dead indeed
sounds lame
man i love war
sleeping early was 3 hours ago
18 incidents, 3 systems
flubs flubs
what'd you do this time
only if it's our favourites <:rooez:399827519286542336>
how was it a good idea?
feel free to tutor me in math <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
good times
listen to war music
<:gwnanamilaceshrug:403295147892277249>
well a lot of stuff happened a while back which caused me to have to retake a bunch of classes
man i love mods
...yeah started drinking at grad party and now all i can think about it trying everything that’s alcoholic
i technically have to be somewhere at 10:30 tomorrow but i got like nineteen hours of sleep today so i should be good right
feels like i never talk to you guys anymore
i don’t wanna be napoléon anymore tbh i only wanna be him when i play my war games
man, i had some crazy pizza dreams last night, tripped the heck out
gummy stop making me stay up
i’ll go invite him to my friends server
now i kick my pants off discord
i know how to by passed the system
back to war
how do you not eat bacon
oh i found it
over 3200 pages
from my point of view what about the wookies?
i mean let's be real, xc1's menus are awesome considering the stupid amount of things that they do
uh-huh
no you dont lose your skyrim license, just your bard college position
oh there once was a hero named ragnr the red
if you find out let me know too i was wondering that
i have no idea how they got that
i pretty much just guess since 3/4 were correct
i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol
so i was actually going to do something productive but napoleon total war is calling me
but napoleon total war
history is better
gonna start an invasion of the austrian empire
i took one class on it at uni
i still want to do a graybeard run some day
that makes me an expert
i did all of them, i'm pretty sure
sadly i wouldn't know very much about that, lol
rueful axe
dammit, i wanted that
also a shrine
one of my geometry teachers never really made jokes often but this one joke i still remember and recite like everyday
since i was considered dangerous and capable of defending myself
“do you know the definition of insanity?” vaas
ask ida on that one
i dont really hate stupidity, i hate ignorance. because ignorance can make you look really stupid
strengthen the empire, weaken the thalmor
i just hate stupidity, in both myself and others
the stormcloaks wouldn't be able to face them
and the nm pays good money
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
modern rap is like saying classical music
what category is pony music in?
who chooses that side
speaking of which i need to go listen to god save emperor francis again brb
how about chant du départ
and it gives you a source of dispensable npcs
i haven't gotten my smithing that high yet
then why side with him if you're gonna betray him anyways?
definitely a country load
they make such satisfying noises when they die
i see falmer, i think chaurus, and become scared
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
that's hakon you fool
and just took the forsworn with it
it's just my phobias make the game hell for me
welp a 15 minute talk about math with my dad turned into an hour and a half debate about god
awoo
i say nay
bad news, they want to kill me now
that doesn’t **add** up <:kappa:374346980136058893>
oh hey gummy, hows the windchime?
yes they're correct in every way
don’t you mean wahter? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
good
i just don’t care about action movies. except maybe deadpool
a tnt a day keeps the doctor away
and to answer that question majestic i like both
probably less so after steel got nerfed
hey that’s ben’s money

dreams do come true
but still, i only really enjoyed one class

rc let me introduce you to this thing called a "microsd chip"
i dont own a car
we are not enabling the bot to post memes
but, i really enjoyed it
someone called me earlier. i didn’t answer, but he left a voicemail saying he wants his money back and then bye
same
tell them to turn it off and turn it on again
it was an automated message <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
if benny is illiterate how could he play the slots?
i should call gummy to get him over here

indian/russian whatever the fuck it was
sane was the annoying one right
you do know thelastsane right?

i dont remember that but it feels like something i'd do
i've only done 2 chapters on statistics so i may not be the best person to ask for help, lol
silly goose? have you ever met a goose? they will ter your world assunder
screw them
i did this
nice job squid
thats not even an answer choice, squid, lol
oh yeah someone from my group dm decided to send a pic of her butt and yes it was covered so it wasn’t inappropriate or anything but i was still stunned

<:lul:305559915714576385>
benny is like the second mascot here
noms tv
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
one mistake napoleon made was at the battle of borodino
im practicing already rainy
and no, the expos never won one
near the end of the year algebra 2 lessons took me on average 2 - 3 hours to fully master and digest
apparently the subscription tab will no longer be im chronological order
i guess he didn’t like the rock
youtube has done it again...
brother's on the phone with grandma and he's in the process of having the same conversation for the fourth time and it's driving me mad
why would i need lock picks?
razelan?
just woke up
it's okay youre not supposed to be able to remember elven names anyway
i never liked the guy but that's a shame :/
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
this is pointless
is that nyan cat
head of the institute
friends decides to troll in server
don't sully that name by bringing it up here
what’s pride and predjudice?
nice
used that 4 cheese-blend
and hey, i needed bones for my glove, might as well do it in the dungeon
the plane game was nice
speaking of which i kind of want to play smash 3ds now for no reason
since everyone has a different role and in the same category
brb looking for cheese
biology, who needs it
how about napoleon total war?
\`\`\`do this\`\`\`
it is always the time for java jokes
with a sawzall and a blowtorch
no we don't need them
i beat you in that
you suffer from a condition called not nerdy enough
yeah far
gummy, i've identified your affliction
but it was something stupid
what?
nvm master
i dont remember that but that thought got a chuckle out of me
that's a surprising thing to hear from you
what did i do
the russian empire sucked after tsar alexander i died
nothing happens
you called it
ww1 one page and was just about canada
nothing?
good job skarm
because
also was asleep 2.5 hours before you sent that
ever
~~so it's fresh in your mind~~
it ends on may 28
id enter that except i can't be bothered to open up ultra moon
put poison on the bows, archery buff potion, and sneak/invis potions
“skarm is weird lol” nice pin
you just put a kitchen in that house
once again the asshole made me super mad
septimus singus has something to say about that
so are we
i have something very nsfw for you gummy
what did you get, dialga or palkia?
everyone here
dialga
same but that is a good one
gummy go spin on a spinny chair or something
i oneshot the jhin and ekko lategame with auto and maybe an e
am i?
why not have a paint concert or a lumber concert instead
drago
maybe
im about halfway through melting down cookies, garlic, and bread into my stomach, if theres anything extra stupid going on today please ping
no rap
so i got between one and a half and two hours of sleep last night
tempted to qupte monty python right now but i cant quite remember the line
wearing skirts above the ankles? society is doomed, i tell you! doomed!
that's not addressed in the privacy policy.
but its 1
just need to find my black lipstick and amethyst eye shadow so i can get in the mood
that's still 800 items each
you don't need most of it
i hoik killed a dungeon guardian fairly early on and then we legit killed another as a group lateron.
no watching nature
something about blue light
it’s 7:32 and i already feel like going to bed. help
probably because javascript lets you do too many stupid things and would encourage bad programming habits early on
dp2 is almost starting soon
good
thank fuck
though i wish i did cape, i hate it when people mistake me for a *shudders* straight
it was
it took me a while that you were not, in fact, talking about diamond and pearl
finally something that doesn't make me regret coming to the theater 20 minutes after the start time
simpsons has been going on longer
spongebob is better now
wait the simpsons is still airing? i thought they killed that years ago
32 seasons i believe
not too bad xd
still airing drago
i never actually watched that show. does it still have fans?
i think rc needs to hang out with gummy more
i couldnt stand ash back in like season 1, where have you been
thanks guys
you haev weird friends
and once i find my mic i'll get on for what will probably only last until i either a) go meetup with friends to binge a bunch of shows or b) we decide to play the vidya games
now i want cheese
damn i said cheese
what foobar thing?
shush panda it's more fun to blame me
who was the asshat who called it foobar?
> dragonite
i am disappointed in his audience but i can't say it surprises me
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
guys on a serious note
sometimes i wanna disappear
it's more or less a religion thats one of those stereotypical ones i guess
protip: don't take the story super seriously
no i don’t
it's deja vu all over again
either she is faking it or yeah
did i say it was morning?
so my choices are be productive and happy, or be social, never both
inebriated
/m,e hugs
now that my gym is open i'm back to 10-5 sleep schedule, which i really just love
fkubs
the liars
so does that mean you hate me
just saw deadpool 2
i call the english language the language of anguish
im seeing ads for barbecue and getting extremely hungry
sooooo
do you want an example of how dumb it is?
i get codes tonight
if it's written out you can decipher, at this point with speaking i don't think you could understand if they used spelling or grammar correcty
flubs can you give me 10 examples of ideas that aren't a theory
if you can make a sentence where the subject is not a noun, i will go drive off a cliff and forward the insurance check to you
flubs
that makes no sense
lol, day off, if only
what separates an idea from a thing?
i should probably talk here more
why does it feel like he never streams anymore
its monday
because i kind of want to start over again
god damn how is this 2 hour track still playing 5 hours later
god damn it how am i still in the lead?
~~yourself?~~
have fun with that
and i was asleep until 2pm so its even shorter for me
i don't either
ida!
was today?
well then back to yelling at people for pinging other people
flubs you gotta watch this amazing show that i am currently watching
power rangers
i just meant like a ceasefire
what?
cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
camelot 2.0 is falling apart because i hesitate on decisions
sleep
your bagels will be stole
very carefully. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
*our* money, comrade
~~i think skyrim is going to be on your phones now~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
"we here at bethesda are updating our privacy policy"
does dragonite not like bluej
im pretty excited just to dive into calculus
like linear algebra, number theory, topology, etc
then i can get into differential equations
my university offers a multitude of stuff though
if i put the same effort into my other classes like i did math i'd be amazing at everything in school, lol
differential equations fascinate me, i wanna learn about those eventually
my ap history course for next year just assigned their summer project
it was invented when a supercomputer was injected with 12 tons of meth, 3 tons of weed, and a pool-worth of lsd
im just excited to read napoleon in america
~~who doesn’t?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
not the best, but also not terrible
did someone say bluej
like last day of notes and drafts taking the last page
what have they done?
my *only* issue is that this is generally the time in the yearly cycle that they start to hype up a main series game
yup looks like it
okay, now that i think about it, lets go is gen 1
also we finally get to start with eevee
i wanna come back to fun stuff to read
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
because gum doesn’t ban
actually get sarah to do it
so i just decided to make a text adventure rpg and implement sound
buy a tv
well shoot, ok
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
which kinda sucks too since i kinda need to rely on a phone to be in contact with my parents to know where to go after my lecture today
good job twitch (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
but you guys never talk when im here
e!will
if we’re taxing people now...
because i have no idea how to make an algorithm that will do this
on a scale of one to stupid how stupid would "exploding footballs" be for a weapon type?
oh speaking of which
nice
time lapse snapshot
i throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~hole in the wall~~ window
and we kept saying no deal
i once won the jackpot on a deal or no deal game at an arcade
and yes dragonite i put sovengarde and the normal main theme both on there
i played through firered several times and most of yellow once
nah i don't have a gba anymore
hai friends ^w^
i was in a squid?
no idea.
must not damage the pages
been a little while since auto pin kicked in
oh yeah
did you even hear a word i said
it appears he did not.
if anyone actually wants to see footage of my exploding footballs let me know, otherwise i won't waste space in the creative channel with it lol
c—a—n—a—d—a
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
hey master how do you say "football" in dovahzul
i would be done if they made it too casual
eyan is starting the sequel to jersery shore
ida has 132 hours on record in skyrim currently
forgot about that one
e!google shannon selin
oh wait do you mean one that i actually use?
meh i hate how all my plans have changed
when i wake up in the morning, i instinctively look on discord and youtube.
i did once
i think this is the 3/4 time
wanna trash talk it?
have fun with the penguins, flubs
(－‸ლ)
exploding footballs break?
i was going to say flubs' current missiles are probably more explodey but i guess not
today's lecture was awesome because we weren't over a pretty important detail in calculus and im super eager to take calculus
so i was happy about that
"2018"
brb food
he said music was gross
how bout, no
is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
no pink
n = o/u
oh no
as long as my pink is unchanged i couldnt care less
yeah because my voice is fabulous <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466>
bc i have reason to
~~does this mean rc needs to get taxed too?~~
everything looks the same....
and <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
had to rewatch my stuff and i did do a good job
i'm sitting here uploading july's videos because that's how far ahead i work because i'm stupid
hmm what to pick
that's a little bit gross
but didn't you already graduate
i guess
time for new friends yes
she has all of that besides science but she got an exception and she probably will pass her finals however she has two online classes that she is not done and if she doesn’t get them done she doesn’t get a diploma
is it possible to finish 4 units of grade 11 not grade 12 computer science in 22 days?
i used to get called out of class just so i could go and study for it, it was bullshit
racist
cool...if only the military was like what it was once wa
work
it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
drago give me cooking advice
i must say, it is rather amusing to be looking for an enemy that turned invisible and then finally when they turn visible again they're having a seizure on the floor due to the paralysis thing
no if you dont know what youre doing
boy were they wrong
usually
and you arent even told what is incorrect,just that it is "incorrect"
relatable
oh yeah, it's officially gay month
should be
im doing a rare editing stint so ill join later, probably
join
what
im gonna work on this spreadsheet for like 10 mins and then bother gummy about starting up another conversation
missed the rest of stream, apparently. oh well.
besides i'll do it tomorrow
since i am free tomorow
i broke through the part on the left but still
i give it 10/10
well the other night i didnt get any sleep
so i would have to show photo id and all that jazz and yeah i may never get the account back or i might get it back
also that separation makse sure you dont have any of the old stupid or edgy shit you put on the old one
nice
quinn
albino umbreon
exactly. games are a form of art
im going to yell at people today
just in case i never get it back
i have to work later. right now, nothing’s happening
this was a dream, now?
your music taste sucks
noms natewantstobattle
so apparently im in charge of a vc tonight
im vlogging now guys
that song is describing me piece by piece
and basically ruin it
gummy be nice
that counts
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i want to sleep, but i dont want to sleep
primaries
good job
new jersey
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
gummy i thought i told you to leave your fishing pole at home
is it rozen's skyrim album
im also here but in a different call with friends
um pimaster
i did it because i was in a rarity mood
for some people it is
anyways where was i?
you should know im a brony
personally, for me i would never even bother with the dock if there's a cable charger
what year/season?
random rare drop
real fans root for teams that haven't won the world series since before they were born
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
yeah blame drago
im no private to you
right person, you thought wrong
there you go
i honestly don’t like muk
and only 1 line of ghost and dragon types; i never liked that
i love latin though
because those are funny
what level honors did you get?
“drago’s boil water”
they were like "the sun moves over a day"
i probably shouldn't get too far into it but to give you an idea there was one hitler fan a few months back
for me
they counted years by the two consuls they had that year, re-elected years were weird i guess
she is my official helper now
i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future
taking latin 4 next year then ap latin
probably no because that would require doing an e!all and discord will probably send a hitman after me if i do that one more time
unfortunately, i missed this friday
a good assassin relies on air existing around them
temportal nightshade
im a rogue with max dexterity and proficiency bonus in stealth. no one catches me
but a ton of people got cum laude
the infinity stones have two parameters
hence parameter in your lungs
and it's 4:30 so it's because i'm an idiot
ehh, not a fan of doimg this
if not vision of them
oh memes are weird
okay another issue with discord.js: the documentation is trash (at least on mobile)
nah just make it less spaghetti
my bot is being developed in java.
can it be done in java?
good job
(long pause)
yeah
and we learned how to graph them on a graphing calc
i dont do it for the server. i do it so that only i can have onii-chan's love

bella we are nerding
shh questioning it only makes it stronger
yeah you guys will have no idea where i got this name from
brb gonna get some ribs
be more specific
guess who i said
mommy works too
tempted to change it to "rc's love life" now
nice
"speak softly and carry a big stick"
we can talk about platinum
i really wanted to say ivan the terrible though
while some people wrote boring things like hockey player
brb sleep or something i guess
im msging someone to ask for a price for a plush
i wrote down i was emperor, huge warlord, have absolute power, and my wife is rarity
rc gets what life is all about
is anyone else not seeing comments on youtube videos because of "restricted mode" even though restricted mode is off
hai friends ^w^
love how rc said don't go overboard
well yeah
i am making bios for each pokemon lol
why?
im bored
id make a darwin project video but it doesnt work well with shadowplay
and he has help from stephen (photoshop) and masae (art)
well looks like im a pillow now yat
yeah i assume it was you with that one as well lol
as a definitely oppressed gay, i demand these shoes for free
asshole 2 is blocked
garchomp and vaporeon as well
how'd research on d.js go?
im bored and there are all of three other people in the room
so are they advertising homophobia?
(sarcasm)
i've seen ads on neither cause a) i use adblock and b) i don't use twitch
yea lul
"hello, i like money" - youtube
fine then.
reading that sounds like work
since my original plan was helping eyan get youtube back on track but it seems like thats delayed til at least years end
dammit
no thats star geezeers
she went through a 16 ounce shaker of that powder parmesan cheese in less than two days
because it's an essay put to relevant video
is that saurkraut?
for a video essay it would
*cheese* is good
this dehydrated milk and sodium blend is not
whats wrong about senior skip day?
by refusing to skip
but it’s nearly impossible to fail here
no because she won’t be done her computer science class flubs
anything that is 50% or over is a pass
and im quite sure that the failing grade was a 65
she has 5 units of computer science left so she can’t pass that
you cant punish a student who doesnt give a shit about school
ohhh i see
dude iss is the best
yeah, theyre looking at their phone. how would they know someone is talking to them if they arent listening?
anyways time to go back to platinum work
for us
darn asshole can’t vc with me while i film
i havent been bullied since 6th grade, which also happened to be the last grade i stayed in a public school setting
hey drago
or youre missing the button
isnt shulk the zelda but a dude person
im gonna stop doing that one day
in elementary that is
how convenient
wanna add me?
help i forgot to switch onto my non-speedrunning version of the game
one requires 100% headshots on enemies that teleport randomly in a game with bad hitboxes
its so glitchy d:
and its so good to kill in it
we lost to the toilet of the major leagues
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
come on
psst, i know you who are. hail sithis
this time i said something along the lines that she would get fired less than a day
damn thats pretty...okay
woah
i am always busy now
only here master
when i am serious almost everyone gets scared of me
you only do public insanity?
they are talking about star wars
i dont feel like logging in on browser though
in xenoblade or pokémon or skyrim
flubs sing a song
youre boring
well if all the singers do it then its a part of the song
the singer just fucking slows down mid word
i been in war with this person for way too long so must get a peace treaty
dragonair and ????
how does that make an relative sense?
mine: 
go home
oh, that’s my day tomorrow
i just build the houses
it would make things more interesting
45 seconds in them: "alright please stop we'll remove you from the list"
and that game uses a butt ton of real songs
posted a thing in blackbird
that’s why i said i **had**
check back in like a month once i actually get some of these things carried over
"3d printer"
i have no idea what to do all summer
i mashed 1
wait i made a list
not if youre all thumbs
i have to smash it against my desk until it comes apart by divine intervention
bleeeeeeeeh
truly the ultimate pokemon adventure
see he's ready
idk master is the guru of names
do stab and boom at the same time, booab, or stoom, whichever floats your goat
and i like to pretend to be him
i'm biased, it has the word princess in the title
tastes like licorice
rip i can't change my server nick to "dragonite - guru of life and laziness"
he misses being aggressive
at this point, nothing is original anymore
rc you suck
yeah otherwise gummy would be running around with a picture of upside-down rabbits also
or 4
12 more days until the old gum turns 18
for high school math classes i've been using composition books with 100 sheets (200 pages total) and for college math i've been using 200 sheet (400 pages)
and im hungry
that seems like too much
im watching the news about a killing husky
is that right outside the window?
yeah, watch your goddamn language
also did you level up recently?
actually
also did my precalc final exam today
while master is doing teh maths im also doing math lul
at my school, you had to take 3 years of gym
im still on the fence of whether gym is evil hellspawn of satan or a fun time for all
nah already completed my required 2 years, but i'll still get up and exercise like i do so i dont die young lmao
kill him
im not named brad
and like three hours later i came up with a great comeback on my way home and i was so happy
im lucky enough unpaid gigs count as service
the majority don’t try at all
today is international jelly donut day
the <:kappapride:379352530863521792> pe teacher
want to do it to him?
get over here
bully
things i do to watch the new pony episode
fuck now you give me flashbacks to that sheep song
and the color depth is amazing.
now i need to watch eqg shorts, finish tmnt, finish justice league action, catch up on teen titans go...im missing a show
i dont believe so
huh, no scratches. i should go play with the rabbit again today.
beep boop
woah is that pixelkmon
went with the new york
i didn’t
bottom one master
the blue jays are winning but it's against the orioles so it doesnt count
no no
they are 3rd in al east
oh rip that was yesterday's game
idk how to read baseball scores
i know
yeah the orioles beat us in both games gummy :^(
i meant the commies
brb now food
i'm teal you fools
well too bad
<:doit:334014889137930240>
now you can
the russian army mostly had peasants as troops, they only had 200,000 regulars
actually eh
you can't tell the future? what are you? a level 17????
five chairs
ban yasuo
(just testing stuff)
flubs is a race
i’m killing rabbits in minecraft pe version
fast food
but i wanna go to 3 places only available in certain states
wont this just slam my face into the ground
who said we were driving?
i got her bugged in the one dungeon with the tiny platforms on the shaft downward
she was still following me in boolean but was stuck on the platform for like 80 load screens
wont this just launch me upwards and then into a spin where i then slam my face into the ground
it's awesome
thank
squid you're slacking on your job, you're supposed to give out baconators to people
hi persom
pokes fish
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
i just got back onto discord
wow, gummy just got destroyed
gummy stop getting deatroyed
again
meaning of life? not worth it
my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
olay! wait wrong country
im not : (
jokes on you i'm on summer break
slow clap
who said emile is here?
anyways where was i?
i don’t think anyone said he was here
it was the rival nickname thing in crystal/soulsilver
and then questioning why he's doing any of that work
i think sumo was kind of a last straw for him
he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
with the whole "the only people here"
stop making me feel old .-.
why did they change that
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
and a gf thats helping with the depression but makes the youtube comeback take a bit longer
then he went exclusively minecraft and i stopped
its not that he doesnt like pokemon
beep
!leaderboard
dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
okay thats it brb
some of them are for pink nus, others are eyan memes
good job master
unfortunately yes
you don't put a blanket on, your put in over you
most of us do
socks are hard ok
dont get dragonite started on faces
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
(◕ ε ◕)
but i already said that about the 5 emotes
it does if you ask nicely
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
blah blah blah /rant
woah now no need to cuss
i honestly dont know what that means but good job
hush it you
since i essentially finished it today lol
except for the updates
flubs
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
after this, i won’t be looking forward to anything until nintendo
i feel like nintendo will either blow everyone out of the park or be a bigger disappointment than ea
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
i love steak, it is great, and when made right, is even better
aqua
okay bethesda legends isn't the same as tes6
i feel like theyre gonna pull something
i mean im happy and all but why
that's a dragon priest
like last year’s nintendo e3 presentation when pokemon for the switch was announced
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
because porting skyrim to the pip boy was just too hard
i died when he said "iiz slen nus" and ice fell out of the freezer
aqua
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
i don’t see you declaring war on countries for no reason and looting cities
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
after i beat them, it was like do you wanna loot or peacefully occupied?
thanks
drago
ironically, this announcement has increased my desire for pancaks
the fuck you mean 3 am?
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
ooh where?
misc. stuff
welcome to our domain
welcome
hello there
we’re a small group
and yet i still dont get any of the stuff i should be doing done
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
its a very fun game
sooo in corphish’s server he has me listed as youtube friends along with other people. this one apparently has heard of everyone under this category but me
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
honestly it mightve been in utah. ive been to utahs capital and one other town north of that i cant remember the name of
master you officially have too much time on your hands
beef?
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
12 pm
and really shitty
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
but just dont play with them
you can play wow by yourself too
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
there's always the vods if you can't watch it
but i need my analytics
like i need a really good excuse for not doing my paper
ah. meant to type that into a different server. sorry.
guys
or youll be alive, if you call that living
i just love this movie
eating raw cookie dough is worth the salmonella
sleep now or something bye
narcissism is directly responsible for all human caused suffering
gummy, i'm serious
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
people in the live chat on youtube keep saying fortnite and despacito
on switch
its been free
so if the defense mode is on switch, i'll be pretty content
happy birthday, bella.
cause clearly epic got *something* right
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
i think fallout shelter is too, right?
kumatora and boney in lucas' final smash
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
not in that order
to the trailer pref
but still i'm hyped!
i'm not crying
fyck yeah
smash is fun but i can only play kirby
i'm not saying the old ones don't matter. i'm saying i've seen what they offered and now i'm more interested in what's new
i mean, i liked sutherland, i think he did a fantastic job
i'm a daisy main for life
and i'm going to stick with mario kart. and maybe mario party when it comes out
or try to hit from far away
i was kinda hoping for netflix and youtube apps to be announced
have a baconator newb 🍔
but cant he just not get the game
i will burn it down
im going to loot everything in site
you'd think it would be that easy but apparently this little to-do has been raging for like a half hour now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
im confused
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
no part
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
so, anyway
i don't think it was bad.
cake or ice cream?
of course ive only seen like 4
i didnt like nintendo this year. nothing interested me
one thing i hate: es6 overshadowing the rest of the conference
nope
yes why
yeah i mean no need to bash their fun
i’m pretty sure there won’t be as much story and stuff in it
i already played a bit of that
it just was pointless at the same time
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
also i didnt play videogames in 2010 or whenever it came out
what about double dash?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i got a gamecube and xbox the same christmas
ct is the only major jrpg i've played through
for not being faithful to the original
the gamecube was my childhood
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
86 years old
do you know how many times i have to repeat how to use it? its fucking irritating
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
the guy who you don’t want to mention?
one let’s player i watch will never play a pokémon game because he thinks the series is stale and repetitive
e3 was fuckin boring
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
i think fan games were just part of my “rotating interests” 
good job 🎉
this guy gets it
speaking of which 18 in one week
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
tomorrow will be worse
what do you expect me to do with a bowling ball
kingcorphish
he probably feels ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
well im kinda not in the mood for jokes
bug/ghost.
actually new orleans
i saw a simpsons clip of all the famous foods in new orleans
yeah but it only works if he stumbles over it a lot and just randomly pauses before really lackluster punchlines
they told me im obsessed with warfare
also, squid,
it wasnt that hard of an exam, but still, it's my first college exam ever and im happy bout it
my bday is coming up and i hate it
destroyed 8 ships and captured 2
muskets though
so, when does the splatoon 2 octo expansion actually come out? i already pre-ordered it, so i’m just waiting impatiently right now
idk show me a plant or a bacteria with a deed
why does it have to be an animal?
we own the land, we own the planet
then what gives us the ability to claim ownership that the dinosaurs couldn/t
how can we own all plants
nice
yeah people have to agree the land is yours. which you prove with a deed
well it hasnt
what does our agreement actually do?
    var a = a + 12 * (3^a)^2;
```
function flubslogic(){
i think it’s out now; just checked twitter
ok, it looks like the octo expansion does have a midnight release. 😑
pfft
~~but they need inspiration for you know what~~
isnt that just calculus
aight cool tried four different emails and finally got it. thanks for letting me know when theres no account linked to the email, ea. love ya
haha, yup
dragonite are you in the steam beta?

can you buy things for me?
gotta say
<:lul:305559915714576385>
and that was a decoy house. for the times that someone might blow it up
i played it for a little bit this morning, but i had to go to work. and now, i have been catching up on youtube ever since i got home. now i can finally play more again
also i need someone to play world of warcraft with
i am the warrior of jolly ranchers and you shall bow you little twizzlers
hes the real general reposti
who's reposti?
you should get it, it's really fun but insanely addicting
well its also a species but thats unrelated
i thought flubs was a group of people
the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army
i just remembered: i have a saxophone in a closet and i haven’t played it since 5th grade
i love cold brew coffee
since the rest of my troops were in russia i was forced to sign a peace treaty...i hate the portuguese
i wish the characters in the train had more to say
i see ninety six, not counting the last one
it’s been a while since that clip was shown
ok, i’m going to try and complete the car wash level for the full cake thing
just like me
pistol. don’t try the others with short range
and don't throw me out of any windows
error, no end of statement or something
majestic spaghetti is overthrowing the bourgeois
night
slap them
it’s like rosalina in super mario galaxy 2
its my extended family's annual summer meetup. which means i die tonight.
flubs bad news
i'll arrange for that
youre asking why i cant go slap the person playing music
it's yelling
yeah and honestly shes the worst cousin but one of the best people. i have a pretty horrible extended family
but yeah, after this i have no reason to ever see any of my family ever again and could not be happier
in game or irl?
no shit
requirements for a pin
i have one cousin who plays pokémon
so is unity and unreal
no seriously reread what you said very slowly
out of context pin
wait might be calling it off
yeah i call bullshark on that
i said me lol, i'm in pre supreme calamatis
flub flub
oh you got it up?
it's cool eyan, no worries
~~don’t~~ blow it up <:kappa:374346980136058893>

i'll probably never touch an mmo
a new royal anthem
no you cant
im bored
holy shit had a dream about eyan uploading again
never before in my adult life have i looked so forward to the holidays lol
i want the most bullshit environment ones like pokefloats, the spinning metroid one, and big blue
the menus in smash 4 were a mess imo
smash 4 menus weren't the best.
i hate clg and tsm so much, i have no clue who i want to win this game
i doubt it will
fun fact, i've never actually played skyward sword
ghirahim
im not dead
i bid thee farewell from the crime scene
*speeds out of control and runs over flubs and into a wall* i'm herreee and ready to parttyyyyy.... oh fudge i ran flubs over

oh hey it's rainy
c e a s e
i had to im sorry
f l u b s
what isn't happening?
real men do let's plays with their phones
and more often then that, i'm bored
oh, i just rarely ever see you say something stupid put of bordem so i assumed you were rather relaxed
i'm just a blue organ so you don't see me much obviously
if anything i thought that because of the purple name
pretending to not want to die is a full time job
~~don't answer that~~
this is true lol
tends to be how people eat yeah
i'm just more active so i can attain red galoer and be haopy
so my teeth hurt today so i had to rely on swallowing most of my food
hehe
of course you sellouts would think the common folk are insane
no swallow without chewing much flubs
and why not a goomba
i wanna play the piano guitar thing
my only skills are day drinking and sleeping in

i've never even heard your voice which is pdd
yall remember so much
and i've heard will as well
persona stuff, you probably wouldn't like it there lol
i remember flubs shoving his mic up his colon but im pretty sure that wasn't on purpose
it's only in place for lesser evolved species
only up to i'd argue 2001-2
natural selection has failed us
anything after that is when common sense died in it's entirety
how has it faild?
btw told you camelot 2.0 will be successful master
oh yayy
hey will

its all backwards
playing 100% orange juice.
does any country not have an independence day nowadays?
make fun of my videos ida
well ida did say she didn’t know what i sound like and now she does
but here’s what i sound like
i watched a dude rob a gun store on liveleak yesterday
but my finger slip so it was jk
it scares the everloving shit out of me
which shows the peak of my power because i can always get my way now
so how is this peak power?
i have a song stuck in my head
eat more
he didnt explode :(
monday. busy. work. hatred. blugh
from what though?
she does not approve of me hurting others 😑
it’s too quiet *blows something up*
<:rarityflirt:447907828187922452>
what>
both are kinda bitchy at times and apparently i have that trait as well
i would say try it...but it doesn’t seem to fit you unless you are willing to go through a whole season
so thats cool
welp didn’t win anything from the scratch ome
it uses location so it would for you
at my place of work, you will see people spend so much money on those and usually not make that amount back
hey gummy remember the time you found a way around the at-everyone ban?
that wasnt really him finding it as much as not following my directions, the much easier way to do it is through the other thing i showed you drago
don't be an undesirable person
am i undesirable?
detroit is an objectively better game but the ending is a little heavy handed
rounding is hard
guess i better take benny out again
i think he was the head of admin of the forums actually
i had a good bday though besides not winning anything on my scratch ticket
hello there
just gotta figure out drago’s bday and troll him im twitter that day
i didn't do anything
twitter
its fine as long as you keep your socks on
since she hugs backs
you could have done something like this
i like grumpy bear
but it’s good
ah good luck bear
neither can i
i never took the ap exam in the one ap class i took; i just paid for the credits
very bad
mount and blade warband napoleonic wars
i sold my console for pc parts

but that was her latest attempt
oh she’s been hitting on me the day she ask me out in grade 10
practically canada
your state sucks drago
you know im not going to let you compliment new jersey to that degree
florida is good in the sense that "it's not new jersey"
oh so you went to the not populated places
or whatever the fuckin quote is
why flubs?
lets go to canada flubs
or rather your showing-id addiction
that's what they all say
free money
sleep now bye
all i had to do was show up to school
i just don’t like the large jump in levels
wait
any cooked pasta is good
wrong channel but good job
because i never heard of that word before and i don’t know what it means
that’s how i feel
i prefer hugh over cheren pretty much being “i have to get stronger” almost every time you meet
(－‸ლ)
and procrastinating homework
you stalking all your friends with it?
*noms sock* tastes like chicken
games tab in friends thing
cant be bothered
random stuff
i hate friendship
so if the sun were to explode that would be a literal disaster
its just math slang
like honestly there are better ones than ours
and thats on the complex plane?
rage face
i think im going to go back to my paper now
why not just play the one thats on windows 7
i mean its detail enough
the seasons are crazy there
what would the baby look like though
i have backup from the source
then its not a virus now
i knew flubs was addicted to cocaine
well misty tells me i have a gambling problem
13 reasons is awful
and that still sounds better than my writing calia
i had enough teenage drama irl, why do i need more of it on television
i want dramatic music
maybe should have gotten yelled at but whatever
i just hate it, but listening in on other people's 'issues' and 'drama' can be really fun when you're not involved
static shock and the zeta project
no kappa. what does it stand for
shit
what you mean wolverale?
dude he has such a punchable face
so i am going insane
im watching it right now
and no teen titans is not in the dcau
theres no second place in running. theres first and theres last.
eventreturned;

it takes a lot to be a good runner and if youre winning you can be an ass
gift me what also you cant
and no gummy
im done being productive for the day
help i cant stop eating ice cream
i will gift you
theres a problem there
just a general hatred for life, y'know, the usual
you counter it with alcohol, the higher the proof the better
its a collection of sabers from fallen jedi
yeah that can't be fixed
what class
thats your new anthem?

(he's bronze)
and the braggart named ragnar was boastful no moreeeee, when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor
i could keep it on a different desk but i’d want to keep a theme and i don’t think a desk from the 1800s would match anything else i made or bought
but yeah my gpu is able to do higher quality on it and it looks just as good
welcome to playing a bard
260 words and counting ;-;
no i saw one with things like witcher 3 and gta in it somewhere

the continents of my mom

hello there
i was barely able to pay attention to yesterdays stream my schedule has been not so flexible
going for high end right away or just straight for something cheap that can play a decent bunch?
i play the spreadsheets
its ok, you still have time to ascend to pcmr
hehehe
fuck yeah
i will also never be a pc gamer
stop
hey, i love the current meta

relatively lower on fun scale
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i wasted about an hour of my life on league and gave up on it
booleanreduction counterargument: no
dont worry, the client doesnt work either
it has crashed my rune pages at least 5 times now
and when you mentioned floats on pc ratings, we just use mod sets for that
why am i the only one who gets hurt?
e!kill master
we have one slot
nice level up message
i do wonder how many of those were me leaving gms running over night, to be fair
hey master remember an age long ago where we wanted to _discourage_ violent roleplay? :')

more or less
oh idk
again
freeze voice?
i didnt do beans to the user join event, that's all on you
i think it needs a few more role playing games on it before i actually spend the money on one but that doesn't mean it's a bad console
except i made the wrong event the first time
right now all the (exclusive) rpgs on the switch i can think of are xeno 2 and octopath though
drago get a job
great
dont you know anything else that could be useful?
you did your first one for free
just look at his code

it's not like it's cold all year long xd
why doesnt it give a preview
this ones ok
i'm inside flubs' head
i was surprisingly popular in high school
which is funny because i hated people then also
no wolve
gummy will give you the tour
my district doesnt have a middle school
also imma focus on getting up so no talk for flubs
there was one memorable teacher in middle school
also fun fact, my mom just started supply teaching high school this year
we have a ™ button
or me

makin' me feel old
it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
also wait if rainy is the mom then wouldnt there be two moms

i can ignore the sounds and listen to the words
wolve luigi isnt a millennial

its not ambient horror but it doesnt try to be
last time i used a credit card on steam and other places
thanks
i bought it to give the creator money
he deserved it
the old man from pawn stars has died
if i do i'm gonna pre-record all my lines on tts
signed in on a school computer now, let's see how long i can do this before the teacher notices
why are we attacking drago gummy
this is why chuggaaconroy is one of the few youtube gamers i can watch nowadays : (
is there a final exam for speech?
10 mi ute presentation on why schools should teach computer science more
rollercoaster tycoon 2
idk but ive had interesting luck with that so far in this school
well you know why he said it?
rude
yeah he was like one of the only authors i read wililngly since harry potter ended
hmmm
my mind just cant understand doing two things at once
legs are good for things even if you cant use them
it's about as complicated of a definition as the average program that dragonite writes
sorry gummy is just rubbing off on me
you are supposed to wear heels flubs
everything
hai majestic
why must it be really active when i’m busy?
*throws math out the window* i don’t need this right now
flubs is your dog superman
man there was nothing like wii baseball
nicholas the second was a dumb ass
thats where youre wrong
well yeah
twister
we want mario 64
my scripting language is hereby known as "orange"
powdered mini donuts are so good, let me tell you
they're good
oh boi, sneaky back at it again with another cosplay
where do i put down my resume?
oh, and stephen is going to meet mal in canada for something
ahem
she is awesome
oh boy
well i've got some years to go
yet you do it and make it look easy
much curlier, and benny has brown on his ears
assassins are a dime a dozen, i'd just do it myself
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
now i can have time to watch batman with the asshat
i would hire an assassin
i just found out we’re on the 15th anniversary of the room coming out
cant record replays tho
had it happen to me once
i remember that one quarter i got a 100+ in a class only to discover that the report card generator took the min of the actual grade and 100
my report cards don't do that i think, mine would register as a 101 or whatever
im the dumbest person i know flubs
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
solving in general is my cup of tea
oh, never heard of it, lol
because time paradox
same
and future
but only because
who were the contenders
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
who’s sara?
nah, kara and sara are both my two least favorites
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
and guns
im like halfway thru s1
and nothing but
couldn't get into it, don't know why
i'm not getting ice cream but just let me say that i usually just get vanilla
super common near me
have yet to go to the ben and jerrys place near me in a while tho
i figured out why she didnt eat this one
wait flubs did you say ben and jerry's in town?
i said pasta
flubs was talking about a show
nice
anything is better
yeah because they suck
almost one year anniversary of something every big
the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
id say your death would be quick and painless, but id be lying
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
i dont have a source on that though
you join the skype chat around july 18-19 of 2016
but like why do they need to do it that way
oh, i don’t see jello that often
hiya
（。_°☆＼(- – )
and those sandtraps always get in my way
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
just finished high school
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
actually my road trip might not be that bad because i get to see my pokémon-playing cousin . . .
pokes with stick
i resent that statement
july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
it’s rotten because of stupid events that happened
i miss your dank memes
zeal is supposed to be the apex of the world or something
i'll give you 10% of my check
so darkness is limited to magic or something
you already have all you want from previous events as well
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
do we though?
but that's just a part of life
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
he’s 8 pounds
brb starting a pyramid scheme
the exam looks like fun
how much time left on aws?
i lose and lose
can't be bothered to switch to d.js?
awesome
actually it's personal so i can't talk about it
i insulted drago!!!
i just know the dates
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
divert 1% of bird game to d.js
that butter replacement is better squid
if you can't run a 1996 video game you have some issues—oh you mean the new one
i wonder how many of those are in there
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
_looks at bella_
it just amazes me what people come up with
did i miss it
how many people care?
only because i play so much mario kart on switch i wanna see how good this guy is
vista
speedruns especially interest me
whoops
fire is ida’s thing
the french wanted the brits to shoot first
and montauk is the fucking worst
they wanted france to shoot first
that seems more like letting your rival pick a pokemon first
correct
napoleon is why all the european flags look the save
yes he missed
it's not as complex as people make it out to be, it's just who do you want to date, and who do you want to fuck
nah spain was what was the early reason
the french were cowards after napoleon’s empire collapsed
either way napoleon would have had a little but of a laugh if the u.s. took canada
it is, and i'm winning
so we are basically brits
then the english did
of course
and hope it catches on
my family is from france
im sharing memes with friends
i am the senate
idk what i'm talking about
sooo yeah
now it's a civil war
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
good
foooooooooooooooood
i know that wasn't the point of this, but i think it's fair to point that out
give me a sample one
manman sounds like a good superhero
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
drago you are in charge of it now
oh i see
shut up i like my version more
idk, try poking him or something
such is the way of htings
but you cant be animal and man
no worse
who said i was making steaks?
and yes
im not eating that
also youre not cooking youll make the steaks horribly
i just bought 4000 pieces of puzzle so cats aren't allowed in my room till that's all solved
also my video editing job got delay
yeah *replaces airbag with potato bomb*
i eat like a soldier
good job
flubs
wanna hang tonight?
thought you had it on the floor
no stream or server today, small chance for monday
4000 pieces just means it'll last longer
....
fair enough
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
do you not know what a stoner means?
well i guess you wouldn't go vegan if you were in it for the taste
they might've changed a few things since than.
painfully so
my bacon for baconators...
i remember something else i used to eat was a vegan product, but they changed some ingredients and well it ain't anymore
nyet
do not sleep at me
as with many products
mhmm
mhmm
whats the old folks home
you arent gummy
half of conversations are fun
i like music
drago gummy called you crazy
which isnt equal
and its almost been a year since the best day of your life
well camelot 2,0
3+ hours in now
horrible server name
people have a reputation of getting murdered here
the fuck would i need moderators for
if i make myself to apparent i will get mugged
or a glock
but it really isnt that bad
i know but i can minimize my chances
traditional news outlets think anything that’s animated is for children 😒
no no kill the old people. old people hold jobs and say mean things so just remove them from the equation
and blamed it for making a kid commit suicide
about halfway through last year
which is kinda similar to stoner voice
chautauqua
a gummy's afternoon
is fortnite turning our children into satan loving cannibals? more at eight
i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
why did the game grumps recreate a meme format
the 12
i had just a minor defensive reaction to it
but he hugged me
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
you know what
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
we know
but i needed to teach a friendship lesson today
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
why are some of the sabers different
interesting
do as i say not as i do
welp
but you wouldn't last
it's bigger and better
something something wookies
of course
send me in
boom
well i assume some of the ones i talked to are there
still didnt answer my question
hence the bitches
nice
did alienware glue those in or some shit?
wait
you will
master
the case i have rn i got for free from brad
there is still a new motherboard and power supply
upgrade
ram is good for me as well
just go on newegg and look at cheap ones
what’s a good mid tower that isn’t that expensive?
unless master wants them here
that wont cost you more than a mortgage
im going to end up blowing something up
ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)
for this league game to end first
oh wait
not really
thats 3 not 2
notice the giant 2 gb in the top left corner of the box
im looking at motherboards
i just saw that
yeah
did something go?
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
nah case upgrade
*throws one piece out the window* too many episodes
i'll make a partitioned by --- version of the doc
shots fired
the thing with e!commands is that nobody uses them after the first few.days
should keep me entertained for fifteen minutes
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel
so other than that, how's everyone doingm
except for like the crash one (me)
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
cpu model?
im not changing anything else
what's this? i won't be getting it back either way
oh i know what happened
gum gum the dum dum for psu get the cx 550w
my sanity
why do you guys carry laptops with you for class?
except for the time i recorded b roll for something while waiting for the professor
you want side window?
for when the time comes
my major is video production
dont burn the server down while im gone
yeah i need to know this too
and what i got seemed like a devil spawn
what formular?
good to know
now, back to fallout
what the fuck
mmkay
mmkay
i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
youre in degrees or rads?
winter is that but with more white
winter is that but with more white
mom wasn’t supposed to go with dad and sister to the city but i guess they did
spring and fall have allergies though
from its bad coding
sister did something even more stupid
zoom 6?
is it valuable stuff?
shaun who?
probably doing better than you drago lol
i wonder if they actually expect anyone to watch it
spring and fall have allergies though
then eat
he’s your son in fallout 4
but i had no clue it was called super tower
kyogre normally learns ice beam, yes
can kyogre learn splash
well this is the other super tower on this site
and you were right
sorry to hear that
no just 55 million and what i would buy
thanks, i mean i think i can reach it since video premieres count as streaming
wait, what?
ok, time for sleep
now you’re in the dirt
was telling the pony server yesterday about me getting ban on youtube
good job
well i know how to do videos right
apparently some famous guy took offense at corphish and handed his ass to him
holy fuck
do you plug a monitor in a graphics card or motherboard?
now gummy
you plug it into the headphone jac
hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
seriously
they're trying to break the record for most upvote post, <:senate:395030198636249089>
la familia went to italy a few years ago
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
of course you have to be sarcastic...
this is getting out of hand, now there are two of them
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
it's a book
fireworks are ez even though i've never tried them
. . . there is no possible interpretation of this where it doesn't sound awful
didn’t see that much yesterday
i meant the former best friends list
though my brony friends still haven’t left even though i have anger problems
that gummy is crazy?
not through blood though
that or you become unofficial blood siblings
as opposed to the usual 99%?
so what have we learned today here class?
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
drago sounds like a robot
no gummy
blitz as on of those amazing deep voices
am i the only one who likes past me on this server?
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
it was enterntaining
i love how drago was like
why would i switch spots with you? and what are we switching spots with?
how come i still do?
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
trust me on this one
what is life's greatest illusion
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
silence, brother
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
im single as well
this guy gets it
yes i'm also wearing the beetle
unfortunately i'm a single loser
or how long was the day before god made the sun
i’m quadruple
yay single buddies
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
of teeny tiny pizza
all this talk about strangling and pain makes me extra sad i have no gf, rip
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
oh please i've done and said worse, now i wanna hear it
she wouldn’t hurt me
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
yeah shed kill you
gummy are you calling me short
oh i called one of the mods in a server "favourite little mod"
you aren't even on the list
god shit on the kaiser!
(◡‿◡✿)
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore
got th modding yet?
there's no max level anymore
can't believe wob found a loop hole through rule 8
i am the most crazy
did the presentation
lmfao when lee sin doesn't get a single kill or assist until 20 minutes into the game
skyrim 620+
im actually psychopath level according to both online and irl people who know me well
eyan found it on reddit
<:treason:396483914803445761>
basically people getting caught stealing at a gas station
very fun so far
kept the 5 ties and bow tie on
that's actually the name of a youtube channel.
it’s friday right?
gummy cant you watch a normal youtube channel ever
sir you insulted my honour i challenged you to a duel
so the duck will have to be the replacement
no chicken
err no thanks
i wanna get the duck blown up by the ship
luckyskarm
“some people live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world”
ooo another pokemon argument
*throws the sentence out the window* i suggest you start over
there thats what i have so far
i want the roleplay
i mean im doing it im third person
“i do not know when the fire in gummy first burn, perhaps he always had a destiny...”
i guess i really hate you
enemies (drago) and peoplei despised (drago)
im writing a biography on myself
teaching the bot to sing is the best thing i ever did
and guess what you aren’t in it!
the pokemon tournament
even though they weren't even in that server to begin with
i meant acorn gun
i got a sword
does coffee have a coffee version?
i want rum right now as well
why is the rum always gone
imma break something
xenobald
drago and majectic sound the same
whatever you say fantom
now if bella ended with a "o" i'd say it sounds pretty similar to "jello" but that's all ive got
right gummy
gummy can i write your biography
perhaps he always had a destiny, but sometimes destiny can use a little help..or even an argument"
panda and squid sound similar...
but i need something more powerful
oh i got it
time seem to stop
thats what i have so fay
what i should be doing: taking the dog for a walk
*takes the mace* i could use this
the irony of that.
i am angry
how have you not gone insane yet?
hawt
penguins
gummy the south pole is not the equator
animation when
｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
ah fuck i put explosives in there too get down
goddamn emote isn’t working
:ya da:
there
for some reason, “ta” kept getting autocorrected to “ya”
why?
would have taken me days at home
reroll that dream
you rang
i dreamt i got promoted to mod on pony server for one week but i had to change my name from supergummying, rarity gif expert to supergummying, wailord master
im supposed to be a wailord master
wait
i hate skitty
im going to get a sylveon gif maybe
he promise to be home like thursday
is that <:treason:396483914803445761> i see
im not sure if that's how it works
subway
i was sleeping
im refering to the server theme nto the usual topic
and looking at the randomness of your nickname history
dndgreentext
did he just hug me?
six perfect for tampa bay
there goes the perfect game
you need more
because i dont already have enough of those
silence you
he’s my new best friend
fineee i;ll ask ida
....
who else do i fight?
she’s my sibling now
no that special tried taking my waifu away
bunny would probably just chew on the cards
thats why i asked you about the writing to a file in java
okay rainy
big brother feature
just copy everyone's stats to a spreadsheet then replace them back into the id form
whee
i doubt that unless you fixed your sue of a character.
plus i do a great rarity
yea wolverale
my face is this 😐
what smirk?
where is luckyskarm?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
well i could always drag ida in the roleplay
you always agree with me
it’s usually ida that drags me around
how are we boring?
its basically everywhere
why cant i have my code just work
it’s fun <:keepo:327304799919800321>
you gotta say ridiculous things everyday to catch people’s attention
and go on from there
you dont call it defenestration
hmm i guess i could take master's approach to the big brother bot and have a timer counting down rather than a timer counting up
you guys are on your own for vc though
why do you think i leave this place all the time?
wait what
helps a lot rainy
all lemonade is created equal. some are more equal than others.
i’m one for regular lemonade
boy do i love it when my code doesn't work!
but i want to know how fallout ends
traps are so so gay
fucking autocorrect
intel® core™ i9 7980xe (18-core, 24.75mb cache, up to 4.4ghz with intel® turbo boost max 3.0)
well
dual nvidia® geforce® gtx 1080 ti graphics with 11gb gddr5x each (nvidia sli® enabled)
let's not descend into that argument
case should come tomorrow or wednesday
editing an advertising video for him
my stuff came
like my new wailord pfp?
i don’t wanna video edit
thats a horrible idea
he is using fimora
invite her to this server
all she does is spam cancer balls and play with stuff that was relevant on instagram last year
actually now that i look closer at it
while i'm thinking about it
clearly not by much
it looks an awful lot like movie maker
cause its unrealistic for some like dragonite or animal man where those might be used in a different context
im not complaining
okay the bot can mention people but i've trained it to not in most circumstances
i have it bookmarked
i was voting for him you know
but um
don't look at me it's not my fault we're out of phoenix down
yeah
dead yes
i knew it
drago's forum friends got the boot
shaymin still shows up on the online list but doesnt talk, superpikachu talked like once, breezaps used to be active but is too busy for normal things nowadays
has he grown up at all?
i told you, he's the mother of all mary sues
and there was one more?
ever since he collab and made friends with people
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
i imagine that went well
i think i know a place
i let the mods do everything because im lazy
that’s pretty much it
i keep to myself a lot so that explains it
1327 for me
he better not be greek
dude rome stole like 90% of its shit from greece
do we call him dragobro?
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
i do enjoy being outside in the summer lol
thats not the proper way to search
the serailzable shit?
so it is
i tried that too
oh hes offline
thats not full ap thats kayle
nice
which items
i just got baned
'; /                          5555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555563 m                          50..7uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu858965555\\\\\\\\\\\/
so basically everyone who wanted to be banned wasnt and everyone who didnt want to be banned was
burn your phone
whats up pals, whats goin on
big brother thing
oh dear
2.5 mi
it's okay, life's a joke
so is renpy
30 mins later
i have stuff to repair it bit the tools are ancient so idk how well theyll work
i have magic
i embrace the magic
hmmm
nobody does
he’s a great guy
never heard of him
you are no fun
sounds like a weird guy
does this look like a healthy sleep schedule?
someone explain to my sister what a raspberry pi is
so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
i'll fix it some other day. for now, code.
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
why's that?
/r/history
same
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
complicated bullshit
what server?
is it my server demon lord?
that’s not a rule in camelot 2.0
where was i again?
oh the rules say nothing about people spying on my server sooo i can’t do anything about it unless he breaks rule 8
good job rc
well some servers allow both
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
idk it’s a reddit discord, reddit is weird
and gummy, have you considered gitting good?
you can guess which one this is
i never talk there tho
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
ask master
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
a lot
i have my own bad counter this time around
i need to get in my pc again
have you injested enough of your namesake
i might give you a hard time on other things, but if you need computer help, i'll do what i can to assit.
is that true?
that’s what i am gonna do today
perfectly balanced
k both hard drives are good
i’ll take the motherboard risk
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
while others say i don’t
update: spare inner tube has a hole in it, too. time to see if i can remember hownto patch them.
reading patch notes is for losers
a guy posted his setup in a server and i saw for the first time an extended super tower
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
that’s just a toaster
theres a lot of anime that i need to watch
now to move the processor over
i never read the rules
e!google server tower
pretty
like this
well maybe you should have considered that before doing something that you knew was going to result in me seeing them on fire
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
they're good for your health
i have a response to that but i have to find the timestamp
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
like i'm thrilled when people want to talk in here but he was making people uncomfortable
oh finnaly
youtube recommends dogs getting tased videos
yay for typing 3d modeling shortcuts into the discord chat window again
cmcmcmcmcmfzzfet
i’m back from work ya ninnies
what about those bean boozled ones?
with dynamite in it
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
the grape one
ok, i feel tired. but if i try to go to sleep now, i’ll just toss and turn for over an hour. but, i don’t have anything else to do 😑
the only thing that pops into my head is why
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
however rated you think you are
be grateful.
well that didnt happen
how are you this night
gummy you _are_ a robot
i sure do
flubs is like dead
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school
i said i thought it was wednesday in another server
so thats today's til
but all good now
because why not
glad to hear it
dont nom
maybe some cables
guys let's just face it, eyan streams when he has time
thats not your pc
melt it down and sell it as a doggy chew toy
windows products
master you are smart with online shopping
and it was still good when i reinstalled windows after some fuckups
i mean technically you said it last tuesday, so....
other than that summer is brilliant
the royal navy is better than winter
isn't gimp available on linux
what am i going off on
hmmm
gummy im going to strangle you
gummy did you say "a terabyte" or "eight terabyte"
that's something i never though i'd say until last year
i have not done anything since i sent it to you to look at
for the record i don't know what half of these do
hang on
and push it to github like a normal person this time :<
pc from the three days made me tired
you know what? that's like the third time in as many days that i've posted osmething to the wrong server
good job
4.2 maybe
whats your point?
what is the music of life?
what is the gift of death?
i fell off the ether mine a good four or five times
im an expert
this is fun
third time being banished
that’s embarrassing drago and you should feel bad
i feel like going outside
and now i visited the moon
stormy old weather
in this windy old weather
rainy here
thats why i am saying it out loud here
pretty sure skarm has to be lower case
well
i'm pretty sure that's the default
he started one, but never finished.
it grows exponentialy
and i forgot how to check
pretty much.
bonus points if you never had one in the first place
wow apparently the league community turned into a bunch of damn snowflakes, i can't say anything in chat anymore without getting banned
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
every ten levels
see thing
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
i am more insane than everyone here
same
well rainbow colour
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
i guess dragonite
plus the other stuff soooo $700?
well except skarm
logitech gaming owns astro now?
nice rgb indeedalso gummy rainbow isnt a color
i have the non rgb version of this mouse
scrub
but made with science
and they did great though was hard through discord
thats how everything breaks
well you better send pics
get rainy to talk to you
sadly
but 5 days
except when eyan streams
i was thinking closer to 2%
and why am i in charge of the vc? thats drago's job
well you guys suck one day i won't be around
i am retiring
you just have something to always talk about
what's going on?
i'm not sure why i was pinged
magus9000 - today at 11:49 pm
no one likes staring at the sun and yet here we are all orbiting around it
does gummy carry a majority of voice calls here?
hmmm
and they turn out like you
and i'm considering the same for you, just need your legal guardians to sign off on it
speak for yourself
yeah
flubs is flubs but he can do my shit posting job
it was just interesting to look back
its easy
though i don’t say much anymore
that should speak for itself
you said yourself, drago, and ida
all of you have access there
that isn’t pony base
give me a dollar
lucky you
i got attacked by a rabbit
dardoch is a bish
and?
break time
like 1% of my deaths were caused by falling off the world though
im actually really surprised
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team
i just pm him 3 hours ago asking if he was dead or in jail
reboot first
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
then a bunch of them appeared
gandi will fuck you up
and um a fried chicken steak would be nice as well
thinkingface
many things and i hate typing on my phone so ill explain whenever im not on my phone
i mean uh
also i thought your town was literally all farm
not that short
i assume you were in jail
yeah
so im kinda like you now
really?
close actually
you are in france
don’t go to venice though
dragonite
im very roman
there are still living flubioids?
bari
verona?
theres no way i havent mentioned that
til rome.equals(china)
protection of the kneecaps money
theres this one town that i visited with my dad a few years back that is literally owned by the mafia
417 days or 14 months or 1.14 years or about the average time it takes for someone to climb out of bronze
well tbh it explains why benny comes to my house everyday
and i see flubs is not dead yet
and needs you to be my wingman
good?
shouldn't it be gummy?
no she didnt
i’m back from work ya ninnies
we figured it out
var spl=message.split(" ");
                if (spl.length>=2)
                var user=usertable[authorstring(e.message.author)];
                    user.refstring=spl[1];```
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
hai friends ^w^
....wow
you are good
we don't talk about that
hello there
```js
no bad
i feel like this is the 5th time the fishing pole story has come up now
good job riot
i tried to but i can't get any msgs off my skype
~~we’re all just crazy~~
so you would have to import them on your end
fuck yeah
yeah thatll do it
(◕ ε ◕)
lol xd
hey master i'm bored and it's too early to make food, tell me something to do with the bot
and even though you sniped me in saying that i'm gonna type it anyway
i vote option a.
i only cook bad food
good job benny (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
you went from rarity to coco
it was the potatoes' fault honestly
i was trixie last week
void fissue in the void
update: my cooking at least smells remotely like food. that's usually a good sign right?
i hate mobile keyboards
same buddy
never insult my waifu
i said often you troll
you also like rarity <:kappa:374346980136058893>

howdy fellow frands
i'm pretty sure i was last.
when was this?
nope i was gone
all set
hilarious
i entered a civ tournament
but tbh it kinda makes sense
apprantly so.
turns out no....
really?
you're welcome.
greetings, majestic.
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
hello, hoe are you today?
that sounds amazing, bella.
rainy please
i was pretty young
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
i come back for one moment and i'm greeted like this? shame on you.
~~git gud~~
it usually ends in a surrender or a treaty i think
i’ll take his apology as a surrender
classic front-loader.
that obviously hasnt stopped spongebob
i wake up to the ex apologizing to me
well drago the people in mlp are smart and know how to end something
gummy just go to magfest so i can annoy you about losing a war to a mouse
9000 was the peak
galacon will still be running though
i've never seen a single episode and even  i know who rainbow dash is.
im the dovahclean
that's where the toilet plungers are
welcome to the world of airplanes
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
gonna punch drago at magfest
how much do hotels cost
you can ask for a boo emote on your lvl 50
i thought it was a rabbit
gonna get led out by security at magfest
or lewdness
but i hate anime
oh good, the food there is expensive
in some places
because it will cost $2000
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.
now to beat the mouse
video games
over your dead body
never book a flight for next day
sounds like force
yeah
oh that reminds me
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
im with c9 even though they did stupid things at the start of the spilt
maaaaaaaaaaaaaake gaaaaaaaaaaaaames
this time i will win
if so try warframe next
you make it sound like skyrim
yes, like the thing you're losing to a two-inch rodent
hell muskets dont even have a point
well shit
nice nice
and my ocd just tells me "hey thats not right"
you should take break on math
drago changed it to the numbers
the whole relationship issue is saved
oh yeah blitzypoo
i won the wat
play total war
i could make a fabulous girl
so i say war
im still single, and this is the first time in my life where i'm legit kinda sad about it so there's that
but i found someone even though she is the same one that tried to force me to be trans
does it mean i want to?
so the chances of me screwing this up is high
i proposed to her yesterday but realize you were suppose to do that way later
i proposed to her yesterday
i've never traveled by plane and i hope to never really need to, or travel in general
wanna trade?
but theyre for flights to vegas and back
have fun
it is real
i know
im betraying my own book
do i seriously need to translate what i mean
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
also star wars is ending in 2019
then i am pretty sure you can do the same
it's not hard
the last movie got cancelled
it says the last movie will be 2019
wanna see what will happen to the darth vader mini dude
that is awesome
he was a whiny little emo punk
yeah
and took power for himself
well can i hate your cat then?
she just said the office
he betrayed the ugly dude
because it sucks
i was inform by my mom
i think you’ll need more
i need to get back on a normal person sleep schedule for when school restarts, anyway
@ rainy
i almost redirected you to anime chat and then remembered that you were talking about mice
fuck
then i will borrow it
what about marsunbound?
do it
that movie was made in the 70s the rabbit has probably been dead for decades
that’s a guy who needs a haircut
i prefer jupiter bound
alright
bella!
cheese?
it is not overkill
you told me benny eats everything
hmm flubs wanna chase him down for me?
bella
thinkingface
you are my wingman
you can slap gummy with it
flubs does not have wings
need your help
get some wings for your wheelchair
well at least we know its an int
flubs only has left hands
and threaten to unleash 50 people on the ex
imma slap ya
didnt you two break up?
this was her ex bf
people are gonna be idiots online
not her
i challenged him to a duel
i fight dirty
i haven't
i can answer that one for him
man i love war
i know
i got war games to play as well
happen before
there are many ways to check a problem
right?
whats your username
it took me twice as long as building the shape to add the letters
i did this same exact way i did another similar problem but im getting results that dont make sense
is it 40 feet horizontally or parallel to the slope?
come back
my calc was in bloody radian mode
the way they phrase the questions bothers me
it is
good thing drago isn’t a friend
imma scare you
697.0 then
stupid shit or just annoying?
guess who almost typed their brokerage account id and password into discord again
nah not demeaning enough
cats decided to make me play contortionist in bed for 2 hours
that sounds like a once-ever-five-year event
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
gotta love having a monopoly on mideival bitcoin
you rang
welcome
why is gummy a fridge?
yeah thats what i thought when it ran on hotel wifi
i tried to scare them
also it only has one u
it's why i didn't suggest krpg.
honestly, i want to see what a miniture devourer of gods would be like. <:lul:305559915714576385>
you hook the rods onto the enemy or boss and it deals damage every period of time as determined by the weapon.
as in pre 1.0.
i guess i should get used to that
i think they just dont care about the feature actually existing on a free version so they dont bother bug fixing for it
i've gotten top of my team for the past 6 games, all of which were losses
i havent been ale to get bits from ads since the time it'd give me like 1000 bits at a time like a year or so ago
like i said
im finally home from the teen titans go movie
when did i do that
so im traumatized since i took my friend to the movies and i let her text my gf for some girl talk
errrr
did you pet the cat
don't burn the place down
well i always wanted to see what a dress feels like
11:39 pm for gummy
spoiler alert
i sleep at 2
alright
nvm you aren’t old enough to drink
probably wont be finished with my work and workout in like 3 hours but thanks haha
gummy this just cramming

0/10 connection skills discord
messages not sending
last night was on the complex plane and demovire's theorems and today is about vectors and ellipses
~~in english?~~
basically z = r(cosθ + i sinθ) and v = ai + bj and *trying to remember general form of an ellipse*
ooh we talkin bout exams
oh nice, which final subject is it
i would ask someone out except the said person i could ask out is currently nonexistent
mmkay
did i hear history
well my gf lives in the uk but i can make long distance happen
btw side tangent i saw someone wrongly say "i believe in you" and said "i believe at you" and i refuse to say the correct way
well thats fine, you might bump into someone better
exactly
they could actually turn out to be someone you might not like so it’s a safer option
okay
what. is free on youtube. they're both on netflix
one reason i won’t be able to hold a relationship is most women will want kids at some point. and i hate children and i never want to take care of one. you can see where that will lead mr
i don't like work
well
unless you are like me and actually didn’t trust your gf
relationships are always hard if youre not 100% ready to be in a relationship, or not sure how to approach it
not all
until you realize you were being an idiot
gummy ive given you the relationship talk so many times how do you not get it
stop being picky
so i was afraid that was the reason
what the fuck
youre lying
rad(-1)
alright heres an easy one
well ida in runs in he family
there was a 2017 gummy?
this isnt baseball
when you do it you just come off looking like a dick
i heard the mets lost 25-4 the other day
i ate it
but it was trending on twitter
i don't know
yes 😛
thats dlc
~~i think throwing him out the window would be better~~
i don’t even watch baseball at all <:keepo:327304799919800321>
hey gummy what's your mouse up to
plus tax
maybe
im shoving off for the night don't etc. the place down bye
is it squid being an immitator or dragonite doing stuff thats easily immitatable
listen to music?
its not doing enough for me
what
ohhh ideepoo we still need to play civ one day
well im sorry i don’t have enough energy to do what i did last year

you’re dirty
also, my opinion on video editing is that, why learn video editing when you can put the time into learning something like photoshop
is what i think it's called anyways
a simple version of photoshop for $100
ahh yes, frame-by-frame editing
gummy can't you have a pokémon picture or something normal like that
my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio
i have the 2018 version
glad to see you alive
do you think ida would be happy to know that i started getting into the fate(?) series? 🤔
whats new with you?
it's gonna be tough but i think i can handle it
drago why are you my mouse?
this was the girl i told you about that force her old bf to be transgender and me
not the war stuff
that is um that is me
someone eli5 what the point of league is
but who knows.
that's what i thought
imma dinosaur
it's like drago 1500 and gummy 8
all because i didn't know what national meant
i know that i am aware of everything that i am aware to know about it
flubs you are not invited to the wedding then
master go away
go to eyan's wedding
so you will never marry sarah?
because both of us are fully aware our relationship wont last. we agree on just about nothing and our personalities dont match well
drago my heart is not for you
you aren't taking my throne
<:gwdogawoophotoblob:402874215759609867>
a long term relationship is emotionally and mentally taxing as hell
shes pretty much an objectively bad person but thats ok
dude i already had trust issues with her
im at the nicest ive ever been in my life
so never
acceptance
i was suppose to love him
remember
treason
um you can't do anything though
i dont remember their names describe them
master there is no place i get to troll but here
idk what you are talking about
i can't picture serious gummy for some reason
i am not
since i am royal
hmmm well i am tired master
bella dont encourage him
good idea
also i am breaking wedding traditions
which will be ida
and the guy has a best man
no you are negative in general with my decisions
what about me?
but a kid can dream
do you hate spongebob?
when you get back
never met him
what do you mean
ill tell you a quick one now
the dude im staying with, my great grandpa on my dad's side, owns like 14 acres and has a small house on it
also hes like super bigoted
i like your great grandpa already
kinda. we get along
well i mean he fought in ww2 on the side that was kinda known for that
or something
oh dear
can i borrow it?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
my dog is being lazy
<:lul:305559915714576385>
you do it
also so am i
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
it's not creepy
ida!
wait, you edited the names in? lmao
alright guys since master doesn’t think im crazy and hyper anymore and that i “lost my touch” well prepare to listen to my new theme song
```java
you didn't notice?
all i did today was watch shows, talk to you guys about my gf, argued with flubs, wanted to meet flubs’s great grandpa, hugged ida, and posted my theme song
ive slept 433.5 hours so far since june 6, played warframe for 180.5, and did spreadsheets for 31.5
also i just looked at my sleep schedule and in 4 days im gonna have to be at a mini physics course right in the middle of when i usualyl sleep
```
like from the 60s?
there are other planets
i hugged ida
flubs youll be dead before we extract gas let alone have permanent settlements on another plane
for once you dont take the stupid side
phones didnt exist back then
they did but they were affixed to the walls
traitor
let it happen
something you did to me
thats like half of a train's interior for one section of the thing
senran kagura: peach beach splash isn't much better.
gummy, plug yourself in. you’re ruining the orange juice
no, he’s a fridge
man i love super mario world
flubs arent you in italy time why are you awake
okay let the birds eat it
wait what time is it there
flubs go to bed
you seem new
hello rc, you’ll really like phantomrc
here is my theme
i’m still squid
i am very new to this server
why am i sad?
needsmorejpg
fiiiiiiiiiine
now you're even sadder
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
you moved on from super cases when you found out they were real
i still have yet to be pinned
skyrim is overrated
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810> 
i really want this pirate game
oh?
that would
all the one piece games suck
i feel like gummy rates games based on whether or not it has muskets in it...
opposite of whitesleep
i just checked his steam profile, no reviews yet
yes rc.
empires
now we need a new table
yeah i was thinking of that one too lol
they even put that in sun and moon
and then it kicked me out
now thats bad website coding
that's the stupidest thing i've heard since... nevermind
define fight, like an argument?
“hi people, i’m superfridge”
i found chocolate chunks in my keyboard
i am gonna clean it
3 in a half years ago
i found dust
and food crumbs in it
thanks
want some chocolate chunks?
im nervous about this podcast
shit now i want pizza
topic is rarity but for practice let’s pick something you know well but don’t like
ah nice
what the hell is gen -6
i’m back from work ya ninnies
ask negative gen 6 questions
drago
arent tax refunds just you losing money for a little bit?
thanks for sharing
i got a new mission
so water won’t wotk
drago
i will destroy it
"water wont work because its *somewhat* water *resistant*"
or go
i’ll be happy
gummy it's too early in the morning for this nonsense
why would i be a home
and bad news
good news i get to meet her irl sooner than expected
see my stomach is not my weakness
and either way arguing is a sign of a healthy relationship, not an unhealthy one
well thats what we did
im pretty sure he has a bio on there
what in god's name is going on in here
he also has a pretty extensive wikipedia page
that should be an option
lets see how long this lasts before mee6 flips it back
soon enough that collection's gonna have an integer overflow or something
that sounds fun
flubs you are the biggest treat
greetings, squid.
im shoving off bye
flubs i don't like you
that doesnt fit in your pocket, and the average iphone user wont want one
but you just said they shouldnt
im trying to prove a video wrong
best modern company.
by smashing a keyboard
most peoples first phone is an iphone
lower cost making + higher cost selling  = more profit
its literally just that the apps are different
theyve done pretty fuckin well
they deserve it though
hence why they are a good fuckin company
thanx
why not
i did it
then once this exam is done it's onto calculus and statistics
flubs
ill start catching up to you in about a month
but its been a while since i've had a full load of courses to deal with so
damn, that'll wake you up
like the first 3 weeks of school i never procrastinate i always get the work in like asap and then after that i slowly start to let it slip
lately i've noticed i dont really procrastinate assignments but i'll procrastinate everything else like my daily stretches for example
brb then
whew done with my stretches
come on gummy
who said it didn't?
this is a satisfactory outcome
good it'll be easy to spot in the parking lot
it hasn't broke yet
i have more duct tape than you have batteries
i don't think so
python is for wimps
zeke von genbu, chaotic bringer of chaos
i'm calling the canadian equivalent of the fbi to put a giant magnet on your hard drive
play minecraft
or literally just mythra
alright
do i
i know what i can do
blue screen is better
stop errors are not better in this instance.
oh shit, i forgot to inclue me_irl
i got league to play
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
i never knew that was a thing
what is this league voice thing?
idk if i am still the best anivia in silver
holy shit you did
anivia vs zoe...
thanks
fair enough
im still a good anivia
but at the same time no
they are better if you buy them from their website
isn't that just like
i transfer all the parts
if my relationship works out i will need to learn the british pound sterling
what?
if wages scaled like they did in the 50s
yea prety much
im so stressed out right now
welp, i've corrected some incorrect intuition now so i'll retake the practice test in a bit to see how i do with the correct way to approach problems i first got incorrect
function factorial(x){
```js
   return (x>1)? x* factorial(x-1):1;
```
same until warframe
the human race deserves to die anyways
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
}
omg i am talking to a russian
god damn i am addicted now
league is good
~~tell me about it~~
the exam was way easier than i thought it was going to be, i'd rate the practice exam a 10/10 difficulty, i give the final a 5/10 it was really tame
just tape everything to your wall
is league earthbound though?
dont think so
plus im like pretty damn good at what the quizzes cover so it wouldnt be very good practice to just redo problems im already good at
bad timing mee6
alright now that you have that out of the way go play warframe
that could be applied to literally any plush though
alduin plush
and i yell a lot
i could have install windows 2000
those last two lines are contradictory
yea squiddy ya silly goose you
do you have a mic stand?
blitz what is my wedding present?
shake me
i can't watch this anymore
but my brain explodes every time i try
youre the math nerd
because if anything squid should be general reposti
kugal
flubs is a smart.
yay i got a good compromise
i was a happy dragonite
lies and slander
so i take it magfest is a pretty big convention in terms of crowd size
im not going to pax
imma tackle drago at magfest
thanks
"i dont know"
splatcord
maybe it is
man i may love muskets
planes were sturdy
hi video games im flubs
sure at some point
im video games
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
oh god the intro
but also nice
interesting
restarted my computer because it was being a butt
civ 6 and 5 are amazing
or solitare
apparently my aunt says it’s a big one
civilization is good
he doesnt play often though so i get it. im pretty sure he just walked into the encampment and lost
it’s civ 6
it’s different
man i love war
but when i teach you
whiskey?
it's like the blind leading the blind
gummy it entertains me to no end that you've had an internet girlfriend for all of two weeks and you're already talking about living together
instead of taking the bus
25 minute work on highway
in another country
laptop?
yes laptop
if you never hear from me again you can conclude i was axe murdered
i suck at getting ayatans
someone screamed downstairs
the anasa's sold for 10 each
how much plat do you have?
how do you figure out their worth?
most people have it off of twitch but in a year or two if its not unvaulted it should have some value
any luck on finding more?
well drago
should have some time today to grind meso n6's
nice
i swear this building purposely messes with signals
no getting axe murdered today
it’s not too old
no idea
sorry gummy
i have no idea what that is 🎉
also thing
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
although to be fair
you forgot farming for low chances lmao
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
so correction is you like to be stupid
thought so
god damn it he's been infected also
sure there is
they go hand in hand usually
thankfully rhino helps a lot
that class.. was stressful
rhino is great
i'm still wondering why warframe suddenly became so popular among certain people
but i could just as likely draw a best-fit line and say it's experiencing linear growth even though that would be completely ridiculous
that's like
no i meant something akin to this type of it
daily is a bit crazy
im gonna try weekly next
the relatively saine weekly version
ida's not gonna like the top row of that chart
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
why are you comparing "book" and "air"
that sounds like a really efficient way to not get anything done
nice
what cant count as a drug at that point
i would say spreadsheets if that didn't count as a drug for some of us. *opens up 3 more in google drive*
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
sliding up the bannisters or breaking all of your legs?
technically he was my brother's friend so he was a lot older than me
no think
see thats a requirement to get into ultra heaven
its pretty much a video thing
i had given up on it, but my brother started watching it so i would sometimes turn around and see it
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
well there are always vods
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
like, the entirety of the ultra space arc is really really good
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing
oh gosh darn it meesex
i am very upset
wish i did that a minute ago
tfw warframe doesnt specify how long your locked from accessing your account
too many password attempts
my one complaint about it is that it doesnt specify the amount of time until i can again
feelsbad
its just an oversight but yknow
there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
i didnt want you anyways
welcome <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
:pogg
you had to do that before?
it wasn't that bad. the only cruel part about it is when they'd give us like 3 days to do em. but that was rare.
and didnt know it had to be an essay until today
why would you have to write an essay in math
that's a line they can access
yeah that's how i found out
algebra is fun
my top two ones are about what i do every half hour and what songs i'm listening to
i wanted to add another class
just helped a student with their budget spreadsheet. fun times
i have tabs for all the find everything achievements
sounds like dark magic to me
greetings, will.
though that one girl is cute
i actually used all the fancy shit on sheets recently
probably because he has to google "most boring way to articulate (x)" for every sentence
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
yeah
i read part of the book and i have to say
ping
no downsides.
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
go for it
i mean like
what's the link there for?
i have this.
link.
omg drago looks lame
or to be even more weird about it
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
oh cool
~~well thats cause youre a mod~~
you do enough work for both of us
i think
gummy stop being busy
the override is useless
what is happening
its best is an idiot
debugging
just twice for me
whats the other jo then
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
whos moving me?
e sharper pointy stick
r2, we're home
i'm gonna start a group with you and the guy who wrote this
my gf plays zombie shooting games and stuff but says animal crossing is creepy
i complained about python on programmerhumor
success!!!! i have done it!!! i have no idea what i did but i did it.
play pokemon red and blue
that's like the same thing right
so one of my cs teachers created a github organization for class
i’m back from work ya ninnies
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
us math nerds are a rare and special breed
in 3
college is stupid
i stopped going in december
im not sure how many college credits i acquired over the summer now that i think about it
ah, gotcha
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
6 maybe?
nah go ahead
i have one
then make one
that sucks
and that was just to test a thing for eyan
guilty
even though that went nowhere as usual
eww that sounds horrible
master if you're feeling like self-harm i can put you in contact with some people
squid you have to get better at secretly making and spending money
hmmm
^ see?
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
thats where the secret money comes in
~~who is demon lrod, master?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
you can just make files end in whatever you want now?
i like how javascript doesnt give a fuck and just plain texts it
a little
if the new program was written properly it doesn't care what the file extension is, and just reads the header data in it to figure out how to parse it
i'll take that as a yea
whats that the code for?
they won 1 and 3
what does that make me
so aqua
100 thieves or tl?
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
same
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
did google give you the answer you wanted to see
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
they were pretty much "don't post anything that breaks international law (((((but if you post it on /b/ we're probably not going to moderate it)))))"
which quest?
third or fourth or nineteenth time i'm going to try to sleep today, wish me luck i guess
got a neo r1 lol
i’ve been lazy and am probably on the last part of the new strange
yeah
i don’t have the glitch if i’m not on ani
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
super weird
is it in the top percentage of rat
but that really is me
drago
punching a hole in the window to escape is justified in situations like these
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
i sent the thing to dragonite
you probably
a thing?
ooooooooooooooookay
enough of that
. . . and then ren'py shows up
who would get pissed off the most if i send it to them?
anyways, i’m trying ketchup flavored chips for the first time
with that i'm going to go do food things bye
it would be flubs
i like how everyone doesn't even comment on gummy's name anymore
we've just been so used to it to the point where it's just normal.
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
and no drago
(2^0)-1
god damn it
the second one
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
drago means
i thought about it
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp
why?
e!censor-all
which one was the one where... ah shit i dont remember any
you said so
im sure there was one episode where he didnt
he does that in every episode
i told myself i was going to work on bird game starting at 8
oh look it's after 11
i already wave a white flag
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
\:thinking\:
this is the original video
question answer
no cussing
i love scones
whyyy
now now gummy
shed probably just scream
that's because your waifu is shit
(am i doing this right)
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
i checked his reddit profile a few hours ago, he got snapped also
finally someone with some brain cells in this channel
so it is
you just called your cousin a thing
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
perfectly balanced. as all things should be
thanos made no mistakes
drago
will you accept?
ahhhhh
fire will stop all four
so will icbms
yes to sm
yay the light's on that means the battery didn't explode
oh it was on my shelf that explains a lot
ah fuck tomorrows monday
fuck yes that means i can be lazy
shit
my mom is ready
stream?
the supergummying youtube channel will return
unless she's actually a competent person
you literally told me to get you banned
notsupergummying
what
i need a name
explosions are pretty creative
well i dont listen to you
yes, and axes are good at killing pokemon
i like when ted talk(s)
drago battle ida
don't forget no wind
.....
lesson 1
which is sogno di volare
my theme when i battle drago
i'll beat you in civ and total war
flubs front and center
but intro music to that
his words not mine
do they think you're a kinky person
friends?
wait
most of it was simply theorizing how long his dragon's penis was
man i’m still wide awake
what about celsius
slee[
<:rooisee:430400878302855177>
isn't tomorrow labor day...?
i asked
oh they're league teams
tl so tsm can't make it
tsm got knocked out by c9
good job
after working 6 days in a row, i finally get a day off (today)
hmm?
man i need better weapons
last part of the new strange that ive been ignoring
doing what
rhino skin should make that easy tho?
it honestly doesn’t last long sometimes
by hurt i thought you meant broke and got excited
i don't wanna end up having no legs like you
a pro at zd
it ended up hitting my leg hard
i do!
oh god i glitched the plains
huh. now im just gone in general
game borders are fun
now im stuck
oh wait . . .
no you don't
also if you have no clue what i am talking about ida
lemme get back to you on that
since supergummying is a curse name on youtube
you just can't youtube
i also have
ida 514 gummy 0
drago 1563 gummy 0
here i'll make a more general version
just listen to friday
~~why doesn’t he just adopt you?~~
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
sorry.
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
infinite health
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
yeah gummy about that
i love muskets
they aren't
anything is a weapon
why does benny have one?
the plot's thickness isolates
its not raining, no
is it supposed to be raining?
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
so water isn't supposed to evaporate or is it just rain that's unremoved?
as time goes on i'm starting to get more and more nervous for calc, lol
theres a variable somewhere in the hello there reaction block
so what have party peoples been up to
oh yeah ive been to _all_ the parties
that wasn't even a pun, that was just italicized for sarcasm
just have it use ints and -- like the old name call alerts
_smells_ like refactoring
what can it be???
i actually just saw that episode of pokémon platinum yesterday 😛
he's said it in like all of his videos involving legendary pokémon
i used to have a really good team that mopped the floor with the uber noobs on battle spot
ha photoshop
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
most of what i remember of early calc is basically revolving around the unit circle
thank you
i don’t remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
cal-bc was where things were different from what i remember being told
i know what to do now
interesting
don't give the poor boy false hope
youtube actually recommended me something good
>implying family gets even
yes pimaster we over his
which is likely when im about 25 or 26
but you will most likely break up before then
maybe
we will see
and yeah what ida said
why is gummy benny?
im just a wreck now
oh sorry to hear that
don't?
no she only has 514 points to your zero
because high school relationships rarely work out
lies
there is no formatting
trans which way?
i know
besides then they won't have to deal with nonsense like people jamming the holland tunnel twice a day for commute so it'll work out for them in the long run
only
thats why im ignoring him ida
i just try to think about how people feel, i guess
im pretty sure my ex-governor did that at least once
i remember people used to like him but now they might not
i know you had andrew cuomo who seemed okay but that was like six election cycles ago and i havent really kept up
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
i watch 5 episodes of friends
but then you have to deal with stupid people
i mean what?
gummy you know how if you try and squeeze two protons together really tightly without any neutrons they'll fly apart with ridiculous force?
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
and british
ida actually has finger
are you sure?
fine
yeah, let's go with that
why shave your head tho?
you people need jesus or whatever you believe in
are you really scottish?
drunk scottish accent... sure
eh, it might sound like that
no, i'm icelandic
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
that your icelandic accent is like a drunk scottish accent
i never swear
you did not have that name before all of the fucks
"from: supergummying#1812" <:gwgoathinken:405753076432109573>
either way wossman also said it
that is dr wossname
i don't drink coffee
i kicked the addiction
i love being an alcoholic
don't do drugs
it's 2 am
<:mhxsleepy:362261093998919680>
they pay better
so at lucky you
hey'
rc and i are twins
way different from a town with 800 people
i think i kind of just want a change of scenery after living in the same area for 17.75 years at this point
but i hate them
ive never actually seen that, is that a thing that they do?
sandwiches are awesome
wow im actually understanding proofs, kugal did a thing!
im in
is she cute?
yay! gummy' keyboard did a thing!
greetings, ida.
help
i need you to come up with an obscure way to calculate the number "twelve"
time for me to go save grandma from herself ill see if she's figured that out by the time i get back i guess
wasp nests are scary
dont think it works that way
true that
though most people do thankfully
you are currently general of the army
what does it mean to not feel tired
i feel like the air is made of fire
ew starwars
i have to feel like i want to read it myself
i'm like 45% sure it is
<:yep:318920218279673856>
i'm streaming gummy, you should throw bits at me instead
it does, just gotta capitalize
does @eyan not ping anymore?
shes not wrong
i need a new gummy
how do you pronounce it?
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
that was a fun one
something akin to e!google but im getting lazier
its not the most noble strat but its one that works
at least it works
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
with that one pubs and solo grinding is also an option tho
when websites go down i get sad
anyway ill be back later
tomorrow university
gummy wanna go to creative writing for me?
gummy scared
hoboism
dragonite give me your creative writing class
i see
you could pass for me
teacher wouldn't even notice
i think i fell asleep before midnight
my brain hasn't booted up yet but i'm guessing i'm going to be in class when that goes off
...
lost on first day
i kinda wanna add a third blanket to my bed
sick
gldd
you might be on to something
sure
god damn it
in other cool news
ooooh nice
ok gl hf
sounds like you understand your job, you just dont understand stupid people
no college for me on thursdays 👀
teacher: who knows javascript?
oh wait todays the fifth
in lastvillage
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
teacher: we are going to have an _awesome_ semester
dragonite: im not sure if that's the word i'd use
brad and i are in ap physics
i was going to express my condolences and then remembered that there are some dumbasses who take ap english
quantum mechanically
sounds pretty normal
that thing being more relic grinding?
these be cabbages
so we by extension are neverlucky
the community calls relics cabbages
how dare they
no the thing is buying another textbook sadly
doesn't matter
about?
if you want to leave during class you can just walk out
how many people are in your class?
university isnt high school
gummy you arent in high school now
so? you can do whatever you want. youre paying to be there you choose when you do or dont go
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
i also, hope you realise i had a bunch of circumstances that allowed for me to leave regardless
and?
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
but ill take coffee i guess
i get up at 5:30 now 😄
i'm just asking for permission
so heres some coffee ☕ <:gwowoblobcoffee:358278223018196999>
alright now the stage is set
so what do you do for fun
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
huh.
hi kugal
probably for masters other ~~random~~ star wars emotes
wooo
physics is fun tho
so probably 2.5 math classes
what physics are _you_ talking about
dang gum
i love this university now
my parents have to get up at 5 am everyday
fuck no
im a night owl
my classes start at 10 am everyday, sometimes 12 pm, but i must get up at 7 am to complete my assignments for the day by a reasonable hour
actually probably a better idea but fuck no
because you didn’t do them the previous night
from 6 - 9 i spend doing calculus
for me seems like history will probably be the easiest one
press f for kugal
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
i liked how, in my statistics class, we could bring a notecard with as many formulas/examples as we could put on it for the final. mine was full, front and back 😛
also he allows students to collect data together on laboratory assignments
one big mistake i made in a couple classes was not taking any notes because i didn’t feel like it
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
hai so delicate
im saving up for sudden school fees
make your own fork of jslint that doesn't judge you.
delicate is playing
greetings, bella.
nice
and drago no
go on
can i visit>
what
often times i skip breakfast lol
not sure that's how it works...
well then no wonder you react when i say crazy things
guys i learnt something today
tbh i just react to whatever doesn't seem boring to me
so what different topics can we divert to that are not bomb-related, kugal?
like 20 minutes over due
~~i thought that was life~~
before 0
im gonna get phat
based on what my calculus book has told me
for x/x
the limit does not exist
thats the answer im going with
it says as x→0 for x/x the limit is 1
well the pi/epsilons leave you with with a huge positive and a huge negative which surely wont mean the same thing except for multiples of 180
mathway probably doesnt use a high enough x for its 10^-x
yea exactly
thats 1
gonna do it in the same 5 mins and record it because why the fuck not
just gotta get another rare rock as an offering first
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
nice
im already somewhat familiar with differentiation
next lesson is on limits at infinity
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
it's about 45 cm away from my head when i fall asleep
(◡‿◡✿)
speaking of that guy
sounds like a swell time
big rip
okay
i'm over halfway through the day
*breaks whoever thought that waking up at 6:30 was a good idea*
break time
feelsbadman
but i have stuff to do anyway. feelsbad
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
alright
through the year?
few people enjoy math as much as you do
pham
watch me
have fun dodging bow
you have no friction
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
there
im in physics class right now
maybe that was the universe also
and when you divide anything by zero you get infinity
from what i've heard and observed
because we can't comprehend it.
the _rest_ of the universe might be but it's probably not and we can't see it anyway
i'm not talking about the observable universe. all i'd say is that if the rest of the universe is not observable, why would we come to the conclusion that it's infinite?
that went to pieces in a hurry
i understood what you meant though dragonite
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
excuse you public static main doesn't compile
when the fallout is distributed evenly, the explosion happened everywhere, never showing signs of ending, thus making us think it's infinite
keep learning
i unsubscribed from pbs space time like two years ago because all of their videos were pretty much the same thing
the big bang
unconvinced of what, im confused lol
i think he prefers the word omnipresent
see block texg
the big bang was five >:(
the big bang hasn't been a hot topic for me recently
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
```on the matter```
i like to think of it more as the boom happened everywhere instead of one spot
excellent answers
i've got history, then statistics work, then calculus
maybe the sky thinks you need to drown or something
draco im going to make _your_ brain hurt
arguably yes and no
why do you have so much water?
im so hungry
why the hell was i testing live streams yesterday?
arguably
let me go to sleep now
huh. just finished reading eldest
and apparently the monado had a hidden monado and that hidden monado had a secret dickson that had a hidden monado. and now my head hurts
probably because i made her dead by playing loud music right next to her ears
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
you hear that ida?
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
_woke up at 6:10_ 🤔
why not
there’s a subreddit thats just full of pets being wonderful and it’s my favorite one
im slowly moving my desk away from people
but i’m sure this semester i will at some point. yay.
today is gonna be a pretty easy day in terms of workload so i got up a half hour later than i was supposed to
<:walkthroughwizard:372149588783529994>
hello there
work in terms of what, kugal?
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
engineering math?
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
oh okay
mkay..maky..
thats confusin to me
so yeah
just as soon as you do a semester of math181 is bam math182
and how strong they emphasis that course
spazzer the great
wuuuut
holy moly
prereqs as they're called are decided on a course by course basis.
once in fall, and again in spring
some courses last six months
aka you need to pass the prereq
thanks but no thanks, already enrolled in a university.
jeesh
same ^
btw, i think i thought that courses are always year long courses taken in 2 semesters as my highschool courses are set up that way
my major is computer networks and cybersecurity.
and by on my way to physics i mean clicking the link to physics class
i could recommend some books for pre-uni study
and a calculus test
online courses yeesh
im going to walmart today
nice
it's a pretty cool uni
i did not get robbed at best buy
i saw a robbery
the guy just had something and went through the backdoor
you're a criminal now delicate
the amoutn of crime is ee per day is insane
so living in a bad neighborhood will eventually make you a criminal by association?
hey magus i gotchu sum questions
oh dat
are you all from the us?
the role
mostly to make the perms for the terraria channel clean
i haven't gotten the kill order from eyan for it yet
you didn't make the bot
well eh
i use flutter bot
i'm just used to calling it source code
sounds helpful
as an example.
then cardinaloscl is mainly for storing information on a per-server basis so i can have custom welcome message display for the bot.
we have very eloquent discussions here as you can see
oh i never knew that existed
but first index runs all weekend for credits
oh shit
nice
i think
currently in astronomy
currently running sortie
welcome home
i joined yesterday
thanks i needed that
i think?
the camera in front of the screen thing
because thats how terribly these tests are made
you tell them how fucking wrong that is
what happened to superskarmory the website?
oh yeah my dsi had a l button that was perma-on
rip superskarmory.net
oh is nick on this server too?
they're good people
well flubs is no help
if you dig around the community enough you should probably be able to track them down
thats crazy
hes fuckin seven during the oldy times?
i feel like there's a bot command for this brb
i wonder what gummy wanted while i was making foods
oh i see
lmao
here healthcare is free
drink plenty of water and scream at everyone
but america has more boat
just be cold. easy
i live in equestria
there's always another bullet
bc you didnt reply the first 5 times?
yeah and its also much worse. puerto rico sucks now
luls
sometimes i am a crime
programming class
well you will if you try to leave america
was it bc of she who will not be named that nick left? was the question i pinged you for
the florida wars
florida wars = seminole wars
ok maybe its a *little* bigoted
the end
lets steer away from that
that's racist
flubs calm down
imma become a professional poker player
gummy look up the australian emu war on wikipedia it's my absolute favorite
its double credit weekend
sets of 15 points for the win
jesus christ
that seems smart
or lie down
mini rewrite
it's been so long since i did what i was supposed to be doing that i forget what i was supposed to be doing
that sounds like affirmation
i hope so
i think we need a new interpreter because you guys suck at htis
oh btw here to share a rumor
but the release date for the next update was moved to the 14th
i just finished reading the 7 chapters i was supposed to read by wednesday this week xp
welp it's been 4 hours sicne i've started on statistics
o____o
haaaaaaaaaaalp
this is painful
yeah that won't work
seems like besides eyan
squid this is your fault
good luck
anywhere else though
dragonite is a flying spaghetti monster
but i think that can actually cause brain damage
i could replace gummy except it'll be more "war" and angry german curses
spazzer how do you say "butthead" in french
i think i have a photo of it somewhere let me look
he said something about dying
air is stupid
gummy you realize all i have to do is give him treats and he swears his allegiance to me f o r e v e r
what the fuck
my headphones are being fucky nobody say anything interesting
i have no idea what youre talking about
once done with these league games gotta farm reactant
nice
nice. i sold my nyx prime neuros finally
submitted my second calculus assignment. i hope the professor likes it
for how much
nice
this leson goes over first, second, and third derivatives...cool
i've taken 42 pages of notes in the first chapter of calculus, wow lol
wtf why do i have 82 plat now
i think that turns on motion blur
im tempted to join but more tempted to see if it will work
how are your 3 mushrooms
i don’t get how, last time i exported a 35 minute video, it took a little under 2 hours to export. today, it’s only going to take 50 minutes instead.
bread is nice and stale?
are you eating a subway in a subway?
~~keep subway in the subway~~
kill 42 with finishers without going down
hey subway is good
only the splodiest memes for us
have fun with that
hmmmm
who needs to open them
not rn
i have a total of 54 credits.
just got mr8 so i'm buying stuff at the relay
there it goes
see?
college
he’s our math boi
the first test i took and got 100% in my calculus course was just a pre-calculus review test
all good
well one semester and three months since for some reason you can't graduate in february
she almost went through a breakup so that won’t help
very ncie work
think gentlemen duel
see?
hello
no never
hello new person
you never insult my honour
i think with how much stupidity is going on at the very moment, that probably won't matter
he insulted my honour
but i brought wolf
hmmm
alright
not within the kingdom at any rate
oof mauling citizens is fun though.
don't worry as long as we beat the enemy
(guys i think the new guy is a perfect replacement for me)
(i am officially retiring)
is that supposed to be a compliment or an insult?
off to gummland and manechat i go
we have won the war
<@477696879186935820> tonight we feast
you don't need to talk like me
gummy is replaced
friend
pat friend?
you lied
hi back from dinner
silly gummy
also make sure you give blitzypoo ding dongs
i am the new ruler of this land. he who controls the treats controls the universe
what happened
flubs took care of that
quick remove yourself from the server rankings
_dangles treat in front of spazzer's nose_
jazz hands
like a shake made of hands
shake
no you cant
i can now
what is reality in zeal?
i already know my roleplaying
i crossbreeded the explotatoes with corn and made none exploding ones
see ya gum
i would insult dragonite
he did
<:doit:334014889137930240>
solve p=np
"kulga"
1 = n
haha p
the fuck does the arrow do
hence the it doesnt equal one
sit
the p isn't just replaced with a number
as x approaches 0 of 3+x, the value of 3+x will be 3
as x approaches 0
spazzer, i will say the most fun person to talk to about math out of everyone here is flubs
no clue
wait so what is he solving for there
doesn't work
258 in an 8 bit system
isnt that the one thing with triangles
why not
depends
xini
yeah no
completely backwards
"258 in an 8bit system"?
i cs
i dotn followe
like
there is a solution
but technically in order to find the numbers we'd need to rack up a supercomputer for hours
they have to
yes and would those solve it?
wait can you even do exponents with negatives
lets go
it multiplies them to that exponent?
basically x^-n = 1/(x^n)
probably
oh thats rad
so positives make it bigger and negatives make it smaller
ok how do you multiply something half a time
that wacky character is a radicand
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
how about just eat some π instead
sums basically
or the existence sign?
compactness
why not use +
like magus's very bad example of a divisor function
whats 0^0
a divisor function?
when would you ever use long division
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
but you just said
yea pretty much
so yep
we don't know
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
because it is very confusing
i always had a hunch
i used to be smart you know
says you
yeah well it's neither
here's another one
well
i have a question
yuckie
cs majors almost as bad as physics majors
it gives an area
so shut up
here's one frmo your lord and savior c++
excuse you im an engineering major
the more physics we know the more physics we dont know
isnt physics just like...observing though?
me too
around x^x
at midnight
yee?
yea i know
1'19 1'199 1'999 1'9999
which could approach one
i dont understand what 1'19 is, i dont know that notation
i dont wanna be the reason you fuck up your sleep schedule
an argument in 5th grade
jesus i don't want to go too deep into this
or a senior actuarial analyst
master did you ever get a tigris prime before it was vaulted
though i apologize for my poor wording about that terrible point i tried to make, i gotta go guys
like geophysics for a magnetostatics course
in physics
physics teachers in general are fun
but i was rolling on a 43 with that prof so i dropped physics and focused on math
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know
65 for math
passing for physics here is 70
computers usually cant handle a lot of errors
i wouldntve gotten out of high school if not for a 65 failing grade
and you *pay* for it to be harder
welcome to canada
they own the hospitals?
nope
government owned
then how do they pay for all the expensive shit in them
like longer vacations
like more vacation time
better credit
you can rent a house easier
free healthcare
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want
so more corporations get involved
no here
thats so weird
but your credit rate is in the 800s
invests in the "heres money" way, or invests in the "heres money we make some decisions" way
every year
they make a lot of money
yeah idk about politics besides the fact that i every time i get money the government eats some
its not mine anymore so if it goes to some rich dude or some poor dude doesnt really make a difference
now to roll it
berserker and drifting contact are from nightmare missions
you want mine?
do you have a spare or is that your only one
yeah i have a couple i’ve been lazy about
oh my god
back to volt i go
btw bella
if you plan on using melee weapons at any capacity
yeah
deserves
aw that was short
youre asking me to change chairs, find the thing, come back, switch chairs again, and then talk hushed like so i dont wake sarah up
"i am definitely my boyfriend" -gummy just ow

you made the accusation without evidence therefore you did it
i'm a cat in a lizard suit in a human suit
meow?
~~i knew ida was never really a human~~
what gave it away?
~~the salt lick.~~
wait what

who are you and why are you patting me
what
help flubs
rainy do you want food
i'm your mother, of course i'm of age
you are not my mother
fuck you mom
she is always disappointed
my homework can suck an egg becuase i now understand this stuff
seemsgood
i'm hungry
i can make a longer and scarier word
oof very scary
that's not scary
beep
you are forever shunned from this point on. *shuns the shunned*
congrats, now every time you try to start something, eclipse will yell at you about missing return statements
like coding?
i know that
notepad++ was the point
checkmate
there's no slap command
okay teddy roosevelt
me_irl
bunch of games coming up for it that i need
i'm bored
most of this is from ctrl+f's
and a bit of !leaderboard
sheet 10 is a pointless ram black hole
no clue
i think the sheet froze
nope time to double it
google drive is gonna suspend me for this probably
damn, flubs holds the all time record for most messages in a month, apparently
this is spreadsheet abuse unlike what dragonite has ever seen
glad to see you missed me
ida is mine
good lord
right now i have a gf to deal with
that youre red
anyone feel like grinding for lith in a few minutes
one sec
i was briefly very confused by that statement
all the surv missions have equal drop rates
this is dark sector?
yeah
do you still need any mesos?
i need octavia part from it too
thats a no go
works for me
44.8
im getting close to having enough for all frames
i'm in a karaoke
am doing a calculus lesson
being social is the worst
also i hope you realize that correcting peoples' mechanics on the internet is very 2008 and makes you sound neither clever nor a fun person to talk to
in what context?
he's an ai
<:lul:305559915714576385>
two dragonites
great now i have some racer's life insurance
i need to think of a better symbol for g in my crypt
btw spaz this is a playlist of music eyan generally likes
oh lmao
right click on botface
and turn it down to 2%
someone needs to draw art of that
or seeing the things on the laptop?
youre stuck with us forever
until tomorrow and i have to head to class
that's not so bad
i didn't want pizza
but was it pizza?
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
leo mcgarry
papa john's is bad
yeah but its papa johns and you have to embrace the future
and freedom fries
in what context?
i think that's a confirmation
so thank you
flubs doesn't know the brick?
so i win is what youre saying
the first scientist to break physics wins
thats just when everything gets boring
absolute zero breaks physics
i like breaking physics
once you hit absolute zero you can never regain energy
among other things the heisenberg uncertainty thing sorta stops working because you know the momentum (zero) and you know the position (unmoving)
you can't get it back into motion
once the uncertainty principle fails
then how do we know thats what'll happen
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
like have you ever heard of solid helium?
yeah exactly
do you know what that is?
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
of helium
probably need more than that for solid hydrogen
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy
so thats 2.4e-15 newtons per atom
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
just boil some water
apple products are gross
somewhere
lost the charger like eight years ago though
somewhere
gravity on neptune is only 11.15 m/ss
why are there two ses
digitizer.
nope
you can keep 50^
vanilla chocolate and strawberry
what the
rocky road ice cream?
when did i say i wanted a light black hole?
black holes aren't black
i was talking about solid helium for thep ast half hour
it’s great
so its a function and not a method, got it
light changes mass with how fast its oscilating
everything changes mass
when moving
well, anything for science...
volta
they were trying to find a cure for something else
and accidentally made penicillin instead
tnt was when this one guy forget to wash his clothes
and something or something
discord has been giving a lot of poops lately instead of page previews
master you've been hacked by draco
it's great
does \ in front of it just not make it a hyperlink at all?
he prolly is one of those many more
he knew it too well
just never get a job and live in their basement
is that your final answer
youre cleaning it up
are they also a piñata?
yes but in not telling you what's inside
39 more
you cannot pat me

shoulder to shoulder generally
kinda how when a student tries to give a teacher a hug, but they deflect and only give you that weak side hug
i give everyone full frontal
my shins are impenetrable from years of kicking
panda bella left behind the spiked baseball bat so you can use that instead if you need it
you're really not understanding the hint
i'm just joking
i swear on my grandma's left nostril i've _never_ heard that one before
dragon resists stupid
it's a fairy explosion
zero times a big number is still zero
its healthbar went from 100-0 as soon as the cry for help went down
poop.
nice
is there a volt prime?
ah ok
its not cold enough for skyrim yet
got it
also pretend to be the reverse flash if you feel like it
that was as close as i could find to lightning
yeah tahts what i used
but its not midnight yet
help
red is nicer tho tbh
dang actually you guys are up kinda late o:
legend states of a mythical creature that only shows up in chat every once every x minutes and causes chaos before disappearing for an undefined amount of time

my teacher is using microsoft powerpoint as an ide send help
heh "commit"
"you might have seen `arrays` before"
i should just ask if i can get all of the papers for the homework/labs/midterm/final right now and turn them all in next week, and not show up for the rest of the semester
oh my god
uhhhhhhhhhhhh here's a better one
```[picture of code and nothing else]

aaaaaa
how do the peoples of zeal do
later peoples
my writing class starts in an hour

holy crap there's a 71% off a 5 pack 100 sheet composition book sale on amazon right now
i got an email...
what the hell did i do last night?
i was on my phone and was messing around with stuff
seems like somehow i sign using my personal facebook
forma alert
or that gummy consults ida on all matters
i tell ida basically everything that happens im my life
you promised me gummy
i promised you gummy \*if i die\*
master i have a very important question about edge cases and execution order
drago
i lost to the school teacher twice on stream in ultra sun
hey my gf already did that
yesterday
thinkingface
just go get it from somewhere else
sure just go wherever that is and steal the native peoples oil
i did not
i buy poké balls in lots of no less than fifty because the only thing i can be arsed to do is hit the `down` button on the shop screen and make it underflow to the maximum you can afford
okay who stole my bagel bites???
i got a message from tatsu to do my homework but im just wasting time instead
i'm doing my homework
i'm a hungry skinny boy
how are you typing then
that makes one of you
and thats the start of skynet
stop messing up the universe, it's unhealthy you idiot
there's no such thing as a gravitational constant
youve broken my legs. how will i get to work now?
also
he's my shark
atlantic
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
did someone say dog?
dog?
they can if they try really really hard
flubs doesn't exist
i think therefore i am
i dont think
the moon
the moon to where
oh yeah big block of cheese
no i set it on fire
like wasting time
why is it when i work and want to do other things, discord ends up being really active
just dont do other things
you know, i think sometimes it's better when it's not really active
hello there
someone lost the sign
hi kugal boi
anyone feel like doing more b4 grinding
is that a yes or a no?
let's go with fractal, why not
excuse me?
imma look at my next calculus lesson
next calculus rules goes over product and quotient rules in differentiation
neato
holy moly it's a short lesson too
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
also known as: colds suck
agreed
i get the weirdest cravings too
weird
it tastes like stale nothing
youve never had anything
you're a plant?
and what country has plants that talk
maybe
i did that once
til kugal is outside the universe
what
theres nothing wrong with setting someone on explosion
english is fun
i dont mind english
i hate freshman and all they are made of
if you get understood who gives a fuck
can confirm
and im still horrible
what is more horrible
or _being_ a freshman
a freshman
i agree
kugally is my faithful servant from this day forth
away faithful servant
oh no, now he's ripping off animal\_man\_.
what
"parados"
which is the fancy way of saying it's fun to put two bad rpers in a box and see what happens
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
that's a lid, not a door
he has already caused a lot of chaos
bot channel, please
yeah yeah
work takes away my motivation to do anything
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
it’s actually really just an excuse to not be distracted by this place so i can spend more time in manechat
did it have victory road music?
i technically sent someone somethign nsfw once
i'm prob gonna do that once i'm finished with lith/meso
so what youre saying is you want lewd pictures of aqua?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
that's all im gonna say on that matter
~~i can change that~~
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
most of my dms is chatting with friends
if i was friends with only emotionally chaotic people
most of my pms is just chatting with friends however there's that one friend that just...y'know
ida you’re stable enough
what is the half-life of one unit of ida
gummy dont be lewd
and that's how radioactivity works btw
2% ftw
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
i just respond when others dm me
dming is dumb. why do that when you can just talk to people in a server
and last night he was having a tough time
so i'm worried
so it’s tough for her when her family calls her a guy
im just worried that my family will disown me when they find out im dating a transgender
so think what would happen to me
welp
well, it's none of your family's business who you're dating
i'm just complaining about you using an adjective as a noun, tbh
apparently online dating is bad and i will get shot
or mugged than shot
will they shoot you through the screen?
wait gummy i didnt know your family was related to my sixth grade math teacher
eh i'll take it
mugged then shot
that was the last thing i needed for boltor
so how is my replacement?
yeah
kinda
today was rarity day
no it's just a big lava lamp
my mom
why didn't i learn about this 6 years ago?
i had bad internet
thats oddly specific
you had bad internet? you want to use this isp here to change your mind on that?
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
brb getting food be sure not to destroy the place until i get back because i want to witness the chaos first-hand
that's rich coming from the guy that keeps throwing junk out the window
me back
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
so it turns out that 4-oz cups of italian ice isnt very filling
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
no just the comic pages
wasnt rc also doing that
nyan cat is weird though
in seven years itll be old enough to vote!
i already forgot
boo?
benny?
im serious
i dont know but i saw her do it and there is literally no reason on earth that i would be ok with it
slam the door
thats good
she’s in uk remember
drago i’ll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
we'll see what happens faster: my beard reaches the floor or you finish sm
what game can we play together
like mount and blade
actually that's an expression that goes around tech columns from time to time i want to actually look up how much computing power nasa _actually_ had in the 1960s
it was like 8 kb of ram drago
because i think this quiz is either wrong or im just stupid
i know 3 ways to define it hahaha
(◡‿◡✿)
doooooooooooooooooooo itttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question
oh youre playing dodgeball or something
mind stone: yes
volleyball
that's fun too
except for the fact that literally none of my classmates were ever good at it ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
but i want a giant cupcake
he doesn’t seem to care
he keeps singing until you die
want me to inv you
i'm like
my physics teacher roasted me today
also i think i have 20 neo limbo relics
oooh
now it'll be pretty
there was also pizza and i drank a bit too much lukewarm tea
it feels so good to be done with statistics work this early in the day
oh i guess i did
screw the bills that live on the capital hills
to be processed
if this was fight club
i would've destroyed all of you
he's a marine
that's next level
why is that surprising
do people not do that
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
ah fuck doorbell
don't fuck the doorbell
i wanna fight andi now
how so
and last time he did that
close curtains?
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful 🤗
welp
oh shit
iiz slen nus?
the best part about that was when i got home
getting assigned an essay on the same day its due
i havent had spaghettios since i was like 5
yeah thats categorized as home
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
you considered streaming?
continually, i've done it before and loved it
bitch i am an amazon
that damage is probably in the millions: i got some 300k crits
if you can pick me up then fuck it i'm down, but i doubt it
im already used to spazzed making no sense but i dont get what rainy is talkin gabout either
i've been able to pick up everyone i've evert met
ahh blokes and their dick measuring contests, always annoying, but always entertaining
enterntaining in general or if youre there rainy?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
bet it's better than what you can do
oh wait
they do that well enough on their own thank you very much
yo cool
good job
boy oh boy
i dont know if i should be in awe of the internets stupidity or appalled
then i got anotha essay to writ
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
he died from essay overdose
i just hope i installed my graphics card stuff correctly
have you tried warframe?
im a kha onetrick now
victorious announced?
dont feel bad
i'm still here tho
yes i am
you're hearing me
i dont hear you at all
why smelt a katana
shipping a sword, that is
it is already useful
it is used to slay the unworthy
he is now deluded
absolute values linearize absolutely
nein
i have a katana
on the bright side, this 20 pound chunk of scrap metal is great for working on like muscle stability
master stop being a butt, sad stop being a butt
is that a quantum mechanics joke
oh the discord cache updates differently now
discord stop sucking
yeah, like when you change `a^(-5)` to `a^5`
never trust a bunny
e!game because that's the way it is
dont all his games include that
bunnys be evil i guess
10/10
the latter of the two
i need a second opinion on something of the utmost importance. is chocolate pizza just a big cookie
thats a strange answer but thanks for the input
alright then
no cookie would ever combine chocolate with tomato
that doesnt make it a cookie
google is never wrong
apologise to google
not chocolate pizza
and if you dont make it with tomato you havent made a chocolate pizza at all
what is that?
have you eaten it?
well thats unfair
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
so you want a tomatoless eggplant parmesan?
thirteen doesnt exist
that is absurd
just like your trousers
shit not again
where did they run off to this time
raise the air sirens the pants are on the loose
don't?
my job here is done
what is your job
your job is to beat yourself?
useless
but i like it flubs
hold on im turning dead robot zombie hearts into jedi focus points to let myself have better mana regen
its nice
there you are now issac newton
since an apple hit his head
and he like discover gravity
and maybe even that the neighbors discovered apple splat on their cars
like an eagle piloting a blimp
no idea ive never played it
same
so who missed me today?
i did tbh
to be honest you're not of magnitude to be a headache
and we didn't ever sign any contracts
of course most of the high-chaos days were from last august when flubs first joined so it's a little weighted
where is jeff and the winter raid on that scale?
yeet i ruined everything
worst
missed half the notes
uninstall it or turn off the phone if you have to
i write notes on my laptop for film class
i was playing a hexadecimal arcade game and got a bit behind on cs notes about date time storage even though he was talking about dd,mm,yy and hh,mm,ss and i explained unix to him after the class was over
gummy thats redundant
i can't understand
master's grandma confirmed to be gummy's professor
well i was also on discord
ok sherlock keep the secrets to yourself
i mean the prof was an old woman
she would be mistress8998
eh could score around a b
fucking
that's the easiest thirty cents youll ever make
citrus just got a lot more fun
well you certainly can't eat it
well university it's different
and i hate it
or in university it's different
you are on your own
i was picturing something more like a basketball court with food
all the while java being noun.verb().verb().etc.
and js being n.n.n.error
look at these nerds getting sleep
and up by 10:30 the day after that to take my car to the car doctor
so microwave your phone
easy
nice
i have to be up at 6:30
kugal
how does that even work spazzer lol
oh ok
i didnt know
flubs
hai gummy
i heard flubs
can i borrow benny again?
he sleeps from like 10ish until 6ish and then idk what he does when im gone but its probably just more sleeping
is a service doggo?
what happened?
how does begging turn into yelling?
that's rude
you don't give like 100 chances
yes she accidentally crouched down to 12 inches off the ground to slap my dog across the face
oh i thought it would have been more like bumping into him hard
but why would you do that?
slap a dog that is
speaking of which
meow
nooo
no cat noises
or rawr
do what i did yesterday
or i can dont
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
almost two?
you fool
it's used to switch between your different windows.
me rn
there is a special place in hell bellow those yasuo mains for the people who thought microsoft was a good idea
at least apples costs are up front instead of $100 for os and sometimes it fucks up and also $100/year for basic stuff that comes preinstalled to be activated
just got back home
it's been a long time
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
also my parents are helping me open a bank account which is cool
i just email the lady my info and she does all her facy stuff and my parents do other fancy stuff boom bank account
something like that
but no one ever asked for my solution
here it is: p ≈ np
problem vs no problem
there are infinitely more solutions where p != np
as many potatoes as is humanly possible
then you just roll that up in a layer of antimatter and bam you created a black hole
it's beautiful really
definitely
good job
id pin that if i was logged in on my main
it's not that i dont want to enter my real password on a school computer (the hard drives get reset every time you log in anyway) but i cant be arsed to whip out my phone and do the authy thing every single time
so what you're saying is one day you might lose your main account randomly
i rest my case
every day
thats the best name
nah its just drago 2.0
e!skarm original joke
why is that a command again
e!kill dragonlite
e!stop abusing the bot
e!ban magus
salt
fuck yeah
rng based farming makes me a sad flubs
i have to hit a 1/30 (ish, usually less) roll 180 times
i’m back from work and fuck grinding in games

"oh you're too good at our game. you don't deserve to be summoned." - with love, from software
dont call smough fat >:c
he is the largest
so he kept eating other boys and then he turned into a pile of mush and ate the son of the leader boy and that son was a god so now hes a devourer of gods. also he ate nito maybe
[insert joke about being a teenager here]
also his friend is a fast man with a funny mask
do you mean patches
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
hes great. he also has an evil twin who makes you eat fire
good job dark souls
i very like the lore. its funny at times and at others contradicts itself weirdly
molag bal?
oh man i have figured out statcrunch
also speaking of getting good at dark souls i hope i can do that soon
whats the issue?
squid's not in prison so im not sure how you stabbed him
disturbing the peace
but that's not a crime
abomination of nature
everything
everything is an understatement
""don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018
"don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018 -spazzer the great
that quote is so wrong
only a pint?
it's larger than a gallon
sounds like a recipe for dying of happiness
i agree with the dragon guy
says the guy who named himself after a black hole made out of energy
now go get a gallom of ice cream\
agreed
good thing there isn't one at the center of the milky way
i don't know, i think i like andromeda a little more
only reason i ask is because my earth science teacher used to say [andro-may-duh]
and i'm starting to say it myself and i don't really like it that much
it's funny the 16th time
nerds
typically we discuss the bunches of reading we do. really depends on the authors. like we go on about their thoughts on matters important to the time.
we cover from like 1620- 1865 three different times
cs data structures: waste my time
creative writing: die of boredom and death
cs digital media programming: do stupid things with chickens
cs programming for game designers: nerd about git on the command line
and also pretty cool dragon lol
well, more like 2
sessino not found
theyre all hallow and selfish
i don’t like them either
that is most definitely a question for her
lord of the flies
oooh
oh yeah there was that one goosebumps book i read where i hated the whole thing and had no idea what was going on
i haaaaated reading lord of the flies
here too
haha
oh dear bella
isnt harry potter just the bible but on even crazier drugs?
i didnt have to read any book in sophomore, i had to read a book in first year
true story apparently
aight
i read them all way back in elementary. good times
its about a boy with a large stick that he pokes people with from a distance and his lady friend that does all the work
seriously though, i absolutely hated doing book reports
since we had to pick the book
they’re more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
they’re all ages, really
awkward
alright i have one more run to get through
a different read but a good one nonetheless
that one was 2 mins
if you count math textbooks are book-books then blitzer's precalculus is my favorite read <:kappa:374346980136058893>
how about literature
mathing out the density of the moon to figure out its cheese composition doesnt count?
if you ask kugal
geometry is kinda fine
i remember writing a paragraph-proof for a problem in geometry and it being like the most fun thing ever
good luck gum
honestly, with them naming parts of the body, would it have killed them to make the names for those regions not fucking convoluted and actually simple
kugal i have a question
my first thought was the millenium pyramid or whatever it’s called
or were you thinking yu-gi-oh and you though of the pieces?
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
meh, nott hat smart lol
i dont think the level of math classes im in were determined on my smartness really
smartness isn't a word?
i'm dumb so i'm going to have a major problem
if we're being really technical
or does it?
bite sells for a nice chunk of plat and forma is self explanatory
plus those anti toxins to boost the rather low odds
one that has gotten bigger in the past 4 years or so
probably gonna die soon
technically he has five holes in his skull
we all do
depending on what you mean on hole, sure
the table is that way. *points towards a hole in the ground*
*jumps into hole&
hullo
i like this green fellow
turn my name back to green! pls
but like
just a little death?
that too
its free
okay who is killing who? <:starlightpopcorn:447901028650582026>
wait what
friday has ida
so anything with ida in it gets a beep or something?
sorry for the spam ida <:raritywink:427916498477121537>

squid you are an invention from phineas and ferb

allow me this as a late birthday present
no, ,it was just that skarm was in the message
i would pillage rome
augustus
go greeks
and i like ceasar
does that count?
idk how to spell it
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
also known as the eastern roman empire master
therse also a spike for me around 1300 bc to 1100 bc where trojan war happened
it broke like, 4 times?
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
oh shit yeah
added napoleonic era spike
wellp, tuba time
tbh i had some interest in romans, a little greek and egyptians
good job dragonite
class took two hours to get interesting, why couldnt you barbarians have talked during that time period instead of after
i discover donations on twitch
has she seen a vet yet
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
or maybe it's the other way around
honestly who needs to remember these things when you can just draw a little picture when you actually have to
sometimes i'm tempted to add wolfram api bot in here
you should give him all your money
wouldnt that make it harder to digest
well she went to look for a female eevee with a nature she liked
eevee you have a 5% chance to find
i don't wanna make money though
gummy you should stream your bitcoin mining software, then youll be melting your graphics card for no reason and nothing will become of it anyway
i just love the alerts i made for a follow and donation
kugal why are you in an english class
i enjoy english
then again i might not, i'd have to add up my credits and see if i can fit it in
the introductory cs course is 3 credits
i imagine that's relatable
in practice theyre more like 103, 104 and maybe 106
huh ok, sounds pretty neat
who knew saying nothing and just getting yelled at could be so draining
i agree, good point
sarah yelled at me
im not giving her the time of day
well she called me
and?
she called me many bad words. also called me an "ungrateful bastard"
not sure what i should be grateful for
ok so maybe it was one
do you mean outside my apartment or in general
but then i realize i probably was being mean
gummy help im out of beer
