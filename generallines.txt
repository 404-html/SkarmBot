you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
fine fine

yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
﻿<:Nay:327308337706434570>

yes ida
he isnt a child
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it

flubs tell them about benny’s casino luck last night

the p stands for "public", silly goose
perfect ida

have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt

as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
christ, and it takes like an hour to launch, too
good
i dont really care what quality its in
high school me was cool. i like high school me. bit of a dick but eh, everyones a bit of a dick.

*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire

canterlot equestria
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
i'll tell you about flubs pm
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
heartgold and soulsilver

i am tempted to add you now so you can meet them if you know which one it is
and who cares if it’s fictional
idk none of them ever sign up for my forums
~~ill have fun hehe~~
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
money chest
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
ho-oh
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
idk never played it either lol
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>

henlo wolve
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
rarity pkushie made in the uk
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
i think that's calamity
everyone said it
just not as much as actual smoking
when you least expect it
just stand there while everyone dances
no, it is literally the opposite
you know rainy is right flubs
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
at least she thinks im lovely
platinum was the last game to have it
we all did
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
coffee drinker
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
it just might overhaul though.
that's the smell of nature, you fool
they charge money for use of the mods content.
how'd you even get it?
that's a good idea.
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
so if i had to guess

honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
physics is evil

how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?

greetings, cadance.

i see someone tried to murder squid again
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
if mr cadance ever asks me again why i like rarity, i got a list.
i always read "defaced" as "defacated"
...what?
or maybe it was alyssa
like this
the windows 10 hard drive wants to confirm alll the integrity stuff, exactly as expected
hey guys i have an idea
how about, god save everyone else because we're going to need it
oh no im not brave enough for politics
mine would be a remix of nuclear fusion.

great now i have self-confidence issues
did i miss something
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
"genious"
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
but when you type `main` in with a capital m you need to manually input {} later on for your code to run
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
i dont want those nsfw ones tho

i don't want there to be too much lag

this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
good
so i don't have to do that ^^^
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
you are not joining
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
:spinning: x3
i do
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
~~one of us. one of us.~~

i'm afraid to join vc xp
how dare somebody play my champ

skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know

ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
plus a server which is connected to the dm
pot meet kettle, gummy
my catchphrase is better
did i just walk in on something here
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
goood gummy
the bot is taunting me
let me guess: same person?
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
never most likely
how goes things?
<:wutface:327309186432237569>

huh?
you dissapoint me and i leave now
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
him and mal (his wife) do show up in the discord server quite a bit; at least one of them, once a day

yes it was dumb bird
i could have done 1804 or 1815
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
what kind is it?
there's another good response
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=

they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
also on the subject of ports secret of mana just got a steam remake, anyone know if it's any good? (it's getting pilloried by the reviews)
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
i also like just drunk ideas in general
hai everyone <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
good mentality
and that’s not green
or alternatively: looking at the abyss
but fallout 4 really is better
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
dayum
i cant get food out of my fridge

"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
i should get it, but again...lazy
even talking about treason is treason
iirc
it's just getting better and better.
you can stop with your pickup lines now

x&y has always been hated
gen ii is still my favorite.
connection issues
oh and fries get a free pass ofc
however oil has prevented gummy from hearing much

wait a second
you didn't even get the joke.
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
no skarm turn yourself in!
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
that took years to make
and they started asking me advice
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
yay!
good job master (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
i return with cake

skarm knows all
or we eat out
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
how so?
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
remember screw the brits, screw the danes, and fuck prussia

argonian?
no, that is incorrect
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
this is healthy
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
i know
sounds good
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
hmmm
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
good luck with that
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
good job
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
won't have to do those things for another year
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
thank you kind sir
you fit right in here. =w=
do i get another trophy for level 60?
no you just havent caught up with death yet
just the one.
the formula was n² + n - 1
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
why are we talking about trees now
assholes need lessons taught to them
we didnt do much abs in precalc
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
so clearly he knew he screwed up
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
or given my personal rating
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
looks like java doesn't care master lul
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
how would you plug that in?
alright, cya have fun
lets get some bagels my friends
<:kingofchamp:335544767616385025>
also my computer just rebooted without explanation
except the mets lost
the bagel song
fuck
wtf is max()
greetings, and salutations, sky.  welcome to the kingdom of zeal.
sure
but what about the masa red attacks on the blue kilwala ?
i just wanna level my jungle, i'm in the mood for meniality and drinks
breakfast today consisted of a starbucks protein double shot, to which i added four shots of espresso.
flubs i'll buy one of those tow truck cart things and attach it to the back of my bike
if it makes you feel any better i can go in and lower the frequency of puns
they were poisoned
oh jeez.
 - say youre going afk to do important things and to ping you if it's urgent
you are quite welcome, my dear sire
2 stands for "write",
color breakdown
wellp
which means almost all movies are sequels
like im decked out in hellstone gear, i just need a muramasa so i can craft nights edge
its fissioninig
anyway, are you free to try it at like 6 today?
oh wait no thats just the weather balloon thats on fire. the sky isnt on fire
ateveryone who here's life isnt a dumpster fire?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
sounds devastating
gummy can i be your best friend
~~greetings and salutations, gummy! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!~~
two things
but hes made of alcohol
how did the count rise to 5 tho?
can i have one
that sounds even worse
in the 3ds version sarah keeps beating me as jigglypuff
>ida has been playing skyrim for 5 hours
i could get work done
how do i delete this shit
chocolate chip would just mean generally anything that isnt vanilla
arent sata cables generally easy to get a hold of though?
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
*kinda*?
gummy arent you the one with the super fancy gaming pc
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
nice
yeah close enough on the zeroes
when was i supposed to learn this shit
just finished physics class
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
it's great
<:lul:305559915714576385>
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity
that chaos!
3 plz
ah hah
and then went rogue.
i’d do it if i felt well
"don't get me wrong, i love lamp".
probably shouldn’t have sat on him...
oh no
master would be proud.
20 secs to load pc
he’s my dog now

final fantasy xv
thats me, baby
ow and also my back
try and launch your worm as far as possible
eat it
wanna try it
i'm was never hired
what were the questions?
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
never timed it though
so when does google make a nation and we end up in some dystopia where they own everyone
i’m back from work ya ninnies
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
do you what?
and only assholes do that
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
it’s fun
i’m back from work ya ninnies
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
because only high quality shitposts make it through
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
no, square the temperature
what do you think?
    }
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
i kinda wanna frame it
then you are safe
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
go faster than camera take picture
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
something about technicians
yeah, i think that’s important
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
what here needs modifying?
lol bob the builder
im a doof
3+4=5
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
i think 5-24-25 is also one
why?
welp
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
idk who to pick though
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
same
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
like doubling numbers
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
theres those junimo huts you can get
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
it's not like the class is experimental
oh grad party will be safe
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
why are you upvoting
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
only one way to find out
yeah we know
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
~~phanpy.~~
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place
also master yoru coding style is abysmal
yaya
it was only 20%?
but like
windows 3.1
so tonight i finally get to relax with empire
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
know what would be nice?
we talked about the art of history
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
also met a new friend at the party
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
get one for everyone here too
i want some more twisted ice tea
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
obviously
that was exciting
i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
i forgot my wallet and came home
way less pollution
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
smart bois
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
it’s legit
it's treason
god i ate so much cheese today...yesterday

?0.0225"?m  
i guess you aren’t hungry
good luck with that
ouo!
none of them are done well, however
so i have confidence that i'll qualify for the course
gummy remind benny that im rooting for him
in javascript and game maker anyway
in java decidedly not
though if i could i would
the following year students were not permitted to change the wallpaper
thanks you broke both my hands

in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
1930s?

gummy stop getting deatroyed
dont get dragonite started on faces
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
again
woah now no need to cuss
since i essentially finished it today lol
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
the fuck you mean 3 am?
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
bully
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
its a very fun game
we’re a small group
and really shitty
master you officially have too much time on your hands
beef?
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
you can play wow by yourself too
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
(◕ ε ◕)
guys
but i need my analytics
hello there
or youll be alive, if you call that living
on switch
sleep now or something bye
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
not in that order
but still i'm hyped!
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
or try to hit from far away
no part
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
of course ive only seen like 4
it just was pointless at the same time
i don't think it was bad.
i'm not crying
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
for not being faithful to the original
what about double dash?
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
nope
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
e3 was fuckin boring
i just love this movie
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
good job 🎉
destroyed 8 ships and captured 2
i’m pretty sure there won’t be as much story and stuff in it
also, squid,

the gamecube was my childhood
ok, it looks like the octo expansion does have a midnight release. 😑
dragonite are you in the steam beta?
bug/ghost.
haha, yup
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

and that was a decoy house. for the times that someone might blow it up
just like me
the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army
since the rest of my troops were in russia i was forced to sign a peace treaty...i hate the portuguese

it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
i was surprisingly popular in high school
i can ignore the sounds and listen to the words
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
zeus got it on with a lot of women didnt he?

well i've got some years to go
hai majestic
she is awesome
oh boy
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
because time paradox
same
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
we want mario 64
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
and nothing but
and future
couldn't get into it, don't know why
i figured out why she didnt eat this one

the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
but only because
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
you already have all you want from previous events as well
july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
do we though?
i'll give you 10% of my check
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
but that's just a part of life
i lose and lose
solving in general is my cup of tea
he’s 8 pounds
the exam looks like fun
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
vista
it just amazes me what people come up with
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
i wonder how many of those are in there
it is, and i'm winning
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
im sharing memes with friends
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
now it's a civil war
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
i am the senate
manman sounds like a good superhero
idk, try poking him or something
good
foooooooooooooooood

master

there is still a new motherboard and power supply
nice
ram is good for me as well
im going to end up blowing something up
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
i just saw that
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
you want side window?
except for like the crash one (me)
except for the time i recorded b roll for something while waiting for the professor
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel

i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
mmkay
my sanity
spring and fall have allergies though

hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
didn’t see that much yesterday
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
then eat
i meant the former best friends list
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
that gummy is crazy?
drago sounds like a robot
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
well this is the other super tower on this site
no gummy
how come i still do?
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
yay single buddies
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
of teeny tiny pizza
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
oh please i've done and said worse, now i wanna hear it
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore

im actually psychopath level according to both online and irl people who know me well
ooo another pokemon argument
enemies (drago) and peoplei despised (drago)

okay the bot can mention people but i've trained it to not in most circumstances
i don’t wanna video edit
but um
im not complaining
dead yes
my stuff came
and there was one more?
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
ever since he collab and made friends with people
drago's forum friends got the boot
1327 for me
i think i know a place
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
why do you think i leave this place all the time?

he’s a great guy
so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
never heard of him
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
nobody does
i'll fix it some other day. for now, code.
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
what server?
/r/history
you can guess which one this is
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
i have my own bad counter this time around
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
have you injested enough of your namesake
i need to get in my pc again
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
why's that?
while others say i don’t
k both hard drives are good
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
now to move the processor over
that’s just a toaster
youtube recommends dogs getting tased videos
they're good for your health
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
like this
what about those bean boozled ones?

oh finnaly
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school

be grateful.
flubs is like dead
windows products
the royal navy is better than winter
other than that summer is brilliant
you know what? that's like the third time in as many days that i've posted osmething to the wrong server
hang on
that's something i never though i'd say until last year
i fell off the ether mine a good four or five times
what am i going off on
in this windy old weather
im an expert
what is the music of life?
what is the gift of death?
well
rainy here
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
whats your point?
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
pretty much.
i am more insane than everyone here
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
but made with science
and they did great though was hard through discord
get rainy to talk to you
well you better send pics
every ten levels
scrub
it was just interesting to look back
that should speak for itself
its easy
lucky you
thats how everything breaks
i got attacked by a rabbit
give me a dollar
dardoch is a bish
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team

theres no way i havent mentioned that
i mean uh
417 days or 14 months or 1.14 years or about the average time it takes for someone to climb out of bronze
var spl=message.split(" ");
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
we figured it out
                if (spl.length>=2)
no bad
~~we’re all just crazy~~
hey master i'm bored and it's too early to make food, tell me something to do with the bot
fuck yeah
and even though you sniped me in saying that i'm gonna type it anyway
i was trixie last week
i hate mobile keyboards
good job benny (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
gummy, you really need to read a book on how to make good insults
well, you’re no help
bari
i am
it hasn't kernel panicked yet anyway
r.i.p. grozard “swormswood” and eletux “elle-ectro”
noooo i just lost two pokémon in a nuzlocke
nope i was gone
that translate to 
alright, same
im having heat stroke again
really?
that sounds amazing, bella.
the one you gotta watch out for is gummy, aka rarity, or whatever he's calling himself right now
when was this?
turns out no....
howdy fellow frands
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
apprantly so.
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
welcome to the world of airplanes
i’ll take his apology as a surrender
or lewdness
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
gonna get led out by security at magfest
because it will cost $2000
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.
over your dead body
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
oh that reminds me
never book a flight for next day
im still single, and this is the first time in my life where i'm legit kinda sad about it so there's that

video games
i proposed to her yesterday but realize you were suppose to do that way later
nice nice
play total war
but i found someone even though she is the same one that tried to force me to be trans
i won the wat
i've never traveled by plane and i hope to never really need to, or travel in general
also star wars is ending in 2019
it's not hard
yeah
and took power for himself
she just said the office
because it sucks
then i will borrow it
that’s a guy who needs a haircut
@ rainy
i was inform by my mom
well at least we know its an int
bella
flubs only has left hands
i challenged him to a duel
people are gonna be idiots online
i fight dirty
you can slap gummy with it
there are many ways to check a problem

sorry gummy
no idea
well drago
it’s not too old
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
also thing
god damn it he's been infected also
no i meant something akin to this type of it
that's like
the relatively saine weekly version
im gonna try weekly next
nice
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
i had given up on it, but my brother started watching it so i would sometimes turn around and see it
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
thankfully rhino helps a lot
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing

there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
i wanted to add another class
you had to do that before?
that's a line they can access
feelsbad
though that one girl is cute
probably because he has to google "most boring way to articulate (x)" for every sentence
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
i read part of the book and i have to say
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
no downsides.
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
i have this.
oh cool
link.
i mean like
its best is an idiot
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
what's the link there for?
omg drago looks lame
my gf plays zombie shooting games and stuff but says animal crossing is creepy
i’m back from work ya ninnies
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
e sharper pointy stick
in 3
i stopped going in december
i have one
college is stupid
6 maybe?
nah go ahead
algebra is fun
that sucks
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
and that was just to test a thing for eyan
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
ah, gotcha
that's like the same thing right
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
thats where the secret money comes in
i'll take that as a yea
if the new program was written properly it doesn't care what the file extension is, and just reads the header data in it to figure out how to parse it
whats that the code for?
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
they won 1 and 3
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
which quest?
did google give you the answer you wanted to see
i’ve been lazy and am probably on the last part of the new strange
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
yeah
but that really is me
super weird
100 thieves or tl?
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
a little
i like how everyone doesn't even comment on gummy's name anymore
we've just been so used to it to the point where it's just normal.
and no drago
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp

oh look it's after 11

i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid

yay the light's on that means the battery didn't explode
ahhhhh
unless she's actually a competent person
the supergummying youtube channel will return

yes, and axes are good at killing pokemon
i need a name
you literally told me to get you banned

oh they're league teams

you just can't youtube
drago 1563 gummy 0
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
lemme get back to you on that
the plot's thickness isolates
its not raining, no
sorry.
is it supposed to be raining?
yeah gummy about that
as time goes on i'm starting to get more and more nervous for calc, lol
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
what can it be???
most of what i remember of early calc is basically revolving around the unit circle
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
but you will most likely break up before then
i don’t remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
why is gummy benny?
thank you
interesting
oh sorry to hear that
>implying family gets even
no she only has 514 points to your zero
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
i know
are you sure?
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
lies
no, i'm icelandic
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
only
eh, it might sound like that
either way wossman also said it
yeah, let's go with that
i don't drink coffee
that is dr wossname
<:mhxsleepy:362261093998919680>
is she cute?
i never swear
dont think it works that way
what does it mean to not feel tired
help
i'm streaming gummy, you should throw bits at me instead
i need a new gummy
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
how do you pronounce it?
its not the most noble strat but its one that works
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
at least it works
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
dragonite give me your creative writing class
sick
gummy wanna go to creative writing for me?
in other cool news
teacher: who knows javascript?
ooooh nice
god damn it
oh wait todays the fifth
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
no college for me on thursdays 👀

how dare they
so we by extension are neverlucky
brad and i are in ap physics
university isnt high school
i get up at 5:30 now 😄
about?
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
physics is fun tho
huh.
press f for kugal
i liked how, in my statistics class, we could bring a notecard with as many formulas/examples as we could put on it for the final. mine was full, front and back 😛
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
i love this university now
fuck no
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
also he allows students to collect data together on laboratory assignments
greetings, bella.
make your own fork of jslint that doesn't judge you.
and drago no
nice
like 20 minutes over due
thats the answer im going with
im gonna get phat
can i visit>
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
for x/x
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
just gotta get another rare rock as an offering first
sounds like a swell time
okay
nice
speaking of that guy
watch me
but i have stuff to do anyway. feelsbad
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
next lesson is on limits at infinity
what
from what i've heard and observed
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
i'm not talking about the observable universe. all i'd say is that if the rest of the universe is not observable, why would we come to the conclusion that it's infinite?
excuse you public static main doesn't compile
and when you divide anything by zero you get infinity
keep learning
maybe that was the universe also
i unsubscribed from pbs space time like two years ago because all of their videos were pretty much the same thing
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
i like to think of it more as the boom happened everywhere instead of one spot
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
unconvinced of what, im confused lol
why do you have so much water?
why the hell was i testing live streams yesterday?
let me go to sleep now
arguably
huh. just finished reading eldest
and apparently the monado had a hidden monado and that hidden monado had a secret dickson that had a hidden monado. and now my head hurts
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
im slowly moving my desk away from people
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
i'm over halfway through the day
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
draco im going to make _your_ brain hurt
mkay..maky..
thats confusin to me
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
oh okay
so yeah
delicate is playing
holy moly
spazzer the great
and how strong they emphasis that course
<:walkthroughwizard:372149588783529994>

florida wars = seminole wars
yeah and its also much worse. puerto rico sucks now
that sounds like affirmation
imma become a professional poker player
i hope so
or lie down
oh btw here to share a rumor
but the release date for the next update was moved to the 14th
i just finished reading the 7 chapters i was supposed to read by wednesday this week xp
but i think that can actually cause brain damage
seems like besides eyan
once done with these league games gotta farm reactant
what the fuck
yeah that won't work
nice. i sold my nyx prime neuros finally
i've taken 42 pages of notes in the first chapter of calculus, wow lol
this leson goes over first, second, and third derivatives...cool
submitted my second calculus assignment. i hope the professor likes it
i don’t get how, last time i exported a 35 minute video, it took a little under 2 hours to export. today, it’s only going to take 50 minutes instead.
wtf why do i have 82 plat now
are you eating a subway in a subway?
hey subway is good
air is stupid
have fun with that
only the splodiest memes for us

hello new person
he’s our math boi
but i brought wolf
hello
oof mauling citizens is fun though.
(guys i think the new guy is a perfect replacement for me)
what happened
hmmmm
friend
(i am officially retiring)
gummy is replaced
_dangles treat in front of spazzer's nose_
also make sure you give blitzypoo ding dongs
jazz hands
no you cant
you lied
i can now
i crossbreeded the explotatoes with corn and made none exploding ones
silly gummy
i would insult dragonite
he did
solve p=np
see ya gum
"258 in an 8bit system"?
as x approaches 0 of 3+x, the value of 3+x will be 3
no clue
isnt that the one thing with triangles
pat friend?
they have to
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
yeah no
there is a solution
that wacky character is a radicand
or the existence sign?
probably
why not use +
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
whats 0^0
yea pretty much
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
i always had a hunch
i have a question
says you
i used to be smart you know
yee?
when would you ever use long division
well
an argument in 5th grade
which could approach one
me too
like geophysics for a magnetostatics course
so yep
computers usually cant handle a lot of errors
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know

so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
that's not so bad
papa john's is bad
absolute zero breaks physics
i didn't want pizza
thats just when everything gets boring
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
among other things the heisenberg uncertainty thing sorta stops working because you know the momentum (zero) and you know the position (unmoving)
yeah exactly
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
so thats 2.4e-15 newtons per atom
once the uncertainty principle fails
i like breaking physics
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy

i was on my phone and was messing around with stuff
or that gummy consults ida on all matters
i got an email...
seems like somehow i sign using my personal facebook
oh my god
i buy poké balls in lots of no less than fifty because the only thing i can be arsed to do is hit the `down` button on the shop screen and make it underflow to the maximum you can afford
you promised me gummy
yesterday
okay who stole my bagel bites???
how are you typing then
i got a message from tatsu to do my homework but im just wasting time instead
i did not
atlantic
stop messing up the universe, it's unhealthy you idiot
i'm doing my homework
and thats the start of skynet
they can if they try really really hard
did someone say dog?
ive been in the atlantic before and theres no sharks
like wasting time
i dont think
no i set it on fire
you know, i think sometimes it's better when it's not really active
hello there
the moon to where
is that a yes or a no?

so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
im just worried that my family will disown me when they find out im dating a transgender
so i'm worried
so think what would happen to me
i'm just complaining about you using an adjective as a noun, tbh
or mugged than shot
so it’s tough for her when her family calls her a guy
welp
mugged then shot
so how is my replacement?
that was the last thing i needed for boltor
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
kinda
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
no it's just a big lava lamp
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
no just the comic pages
im serious
we'll see what happens faster: my beard reaches the floor or you finish sm
slam the door
drago i’ll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
like mount and blade
what game can we play together
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question
oh youre playing dodgeball or something
mind stone: yes
volleyball
my physics teacher roasted me today
that's fun too
there was also pizza and i drank a bit too much lukewarm tea
why is that surprising
also i think i have 20 neo limbo relics
if this was fight club
oh i guess i did
now it'll be pretty
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
do people not do that
the best part about that was when i got home
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful 🤗
i wanna fight andi now
how so
getting assigned an essay on the same day its due
welp
oh shit
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
im already used to spazzed making no sense but i dont get what rainy is talkin gabout either
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
he died from essay overdose
have you tried warframe?
boy oh boy
i dont know if i should be in awe of the internets stupidity or appalled
i dont hear you at all
i'm still here tho
absolute values linearize absolutely
why smelt a katana
on the bright side, this 20 pound chunk of scrap metal is great for working on like muscle stability
is that a quantum mechanics joke
shipping a sword, that is
never trust a bunny
discord stop sucking
you're hearing me
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
the latter of the two
raise the air sirens the pants are on the loose
shit not again
no cookie would ever combine chocolate with tomato
where did they run off to this time
thirteen doesnt exist
apologise to google
your job is to beat yourself?
but i like it flubs
what is that?
hold on im turning dead robot zombie hearts into jedi focus points to let myself have better mana regen
like an eagle piloting a blimp
and he like discover gravity
its nice
no idea ive never played it
i can't understand
uninstall it or turn off the phone if you have to
same
i write notes on my laptop for film class
she would be mistress8998
or in university it's different
citrus just got a lot more fun
all the while java being noun.verb().verb().etc.
what happened?
look at these nerds getting sleep
is a service doggo?
flubs
but why would you do that?
or rawr
speaking of which
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
also my parents are helping me open a bank account which is cool
something like that
it's been a long time
but no one ever asked for my solution
e!skarm original joke
definitely
as many potatoes as is humanly possible
thats the best name
there are infinitely more solutions where p != np
fuck yeah
he is the largest
also his friend is a fast man with a funny mask
also speaking of getting good at dark souls i hope i can do that soon
""don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018
oh man i have figured out statcrunch
hes great. he also has an evil twin who makes you eat fire
do you mean patches
abomination of nature
everything
"don't quote on me on that" master 2018" - squidofbaconater 2018 -spazzer the great
now go get a gallom of ice cream\
typically we discuss the bunches of reading we do. really depends on the authors. like we go on about their thoughts on matters important to the time.
nerds
isnt harry potter just the bible but on even crazier drugs?
it's larger than a gallon
i don’t like them either
oh dear bella
oooh
a different read but a good one nonetheless
since we had to pick the book
i read them all way back in elementary. good times
true story apparently
well, more like 2
my first thought was the millenium pyramid or whatever it’s called
they’re more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
bite sells for a nice chunk of plat and forma is self explanatory
depending on what you mean on hole, sure
i like this green fellow
or were you thinking yu-gi-oh and you though of the pieces?
here too
friday has ida
that too
its a 3 letter word, do you expect it to never come up in conversation?
its free
squid you are an invention from phineas and ferb
allow me this as a late birthday present
hes a bac*onator* not inator
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
does that count?
it broke like, 4 times?
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
i discover donations on twitch
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
tbh i had some interest in romans, a little greek and egyptians
honestly who needs to remember these things when you can just draw a little picture when you actually have to
oh shit yeah
you should give him all your money
turn my name back to green! pls
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
then again i might not, i'd have to add up my credits and see if i can fit it in
kugal why are you in an english class
the introductory cs course is 3 credits
i agree, good point
wouldnt that make it harder to digest
i imagine that's relatable
i enjoy english
do you mean outside my apartment or in general
and?
ok so maybe it was one
that's a noni
it's strong
exponential derivatives are that easy?
what do i do
but then i realize i probably was being mean
last 10 mins of ap physics was throwing around paper airplanes
well go get a cat
is that still a thing
go play with your cat or something
also i like this part of the chart
and pet
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
whats the advantage of online classes
i thought all moms did this - no not really
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
plus i cant drive cos im a moron, lol
i wish i could say the same
driving is easy
ive brought this on myself havent i
i like that
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
wait
wow my stat test today is 5 questions
appreciate it buddy
nope they dont offer math130 😦
100%on stat test woop woop
ouch
nintendo direct just happened
wait
whomst aboot
good
also good job
hooray for books and food
you just answered your own question
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
a what did a what and played what and where was i
that's a good amount
drago you have to hear it to know it
you know i said in the literal sense
my goodness
oh cool whens that coming out
anyway, for warframe, i've heard rumors about that going on the switch, so i'm not too surprised with it going on the thing plus it's on every current gen console thus far
i gotchu squid
~~xenoblade x~~
there’s no 2nd “s”
i know mario maker hasn’t
plaaaaaaay something else
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
they kinda have ongoing costs
im actually rewiring slon to be 2% cleaner
gta v is pretty expensive. now that one is pretty crazy
so why not put your games on the money printer
nice
nice
if its on steam someone is gonna buy it. example: i bought 8 copies of robot rollerderpy disco dodgeball
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
axi s3 and v7, specifically
how do you think that is?
i should just learn to code in my sleep
and the answer checker liked to do things like mark `x=5 m/s` wrong because it was looking for something like `x = 5 m/s`
decisions, decisions
there are too many darn fortnite videos
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
fuck it
so i have an english essay tomorrow
just looked at it. it’s crazy how far and wide it hits the east coast
(okay so a half hout later im _actually_ going to make an effort to kick myself off the computer bye)
i just spend my day off doing all of my homework
t=+1 hour and still cant sleep, as per usual
you dedicate one day to homework?
i need problems to invent stuff to solve for a class
hmmm
can you react with both to this message
priorities are s3 and v7
technology has gone too far
give me problems
*slaps roof of cipher* apgt dpewp trebawqq bfdoq horcwhp
he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp
this is nothing.
convert back later
*smacks cipher* this bad boy can block so many people
add me if you want
hes helping me with my resume
am or pm
so how did you decide i would get that one?
i live on the edge
or is that just a random one in my possession?
im up for grinding now btw
new pokemon looks amazing
eh, i'll do it tomorrow
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
look at the picture
greece
thats the time that matters
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
i got a good insult
learning games
fair enough
nope
so much frigging effort
he wouldnt take the thing with him
today i learned that dippin dots has its own cereal.. :
who's good with computers here btw?
whatcha up to
aqua relic grinding?
and again it won't stay in the middle of the screen when i drag it there, and reopen it
with nothing to play it on because when i suggested i get the ps2 that was $10 more than it instead and i told her i only had one game she said to get another game
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
i really need a better rhino set up 🤔
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
watch as it's amiibo festival deluxe
no effect
nope
i need a sister that fits under my category
why is that even a question
oh the horror
if i ever make fun of your code style again just remind me that you have a twelve-year-old sister
your dog making cat noises
me hungry
my hearing is pretty bad
my gf making mudbray noises
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
like how there’s a venom movie without spider-man
i had no reference so i thought they were good
flubs
emo spiderman.
barely <:roothink:399827523581771796>
demon lord stop being old
speaking of skyrim
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
panda stop
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
"cane" -> [kayn]
it's from that one berenstein bears book
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
you shant be forgiven
<:gwnonaismug:373159826525519872>
hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
i mean water can be synthesized as a product of cellular respiration and stuff
i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
i too like panada's
twitter is the best social network there is, but that's like saying that
good job windows
did someone say chickens
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
update the update
hey master fun fact: you're at least 85% of the fact i don't believe in the pc master race
bye pnada
you should joint he party
demon lord why must you encourage gummy thus
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
and also the first kirby game but that doesnt count since it's only like three levels
master are you compensating for something
flubs let's be honest
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
gummy is cheating
exactly
i update it monthly
master stop being stupid, demon lord stop trying to argue with stupid
do you keep up with this or is it constantly updating?
bella and aminal
in other news dogs in cars are fun
no i mean like all the other people who are red you cant see it
its not a toggle
i played as waluigi i think
hello hello hello lol ^w^
yeah
i have officially bandwagon from tsm to c9
you can only trade primes
or an array of booleans
be at worlds
to what degree of certainty do you say that
i mean
i believe so
now i'm getting flashbacks to chessmaster 9000.
which is their week 1
today “drop the whole fucking team”
nice
i just import it to gimp
got 3/5 becuase of the screwed up questions
can you display that to three significant digits?
hey kugal
the one holiday i hate
yeah but master if you work the night shift that implies you can sleep during the _day_
thats about what i expected
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
ask him if i can turn it in as my poetry assignment for my writing class
two hours until class starts and i dont have anying to do and my phone's on 30%
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
hey kugal
good job discord mobile
yesterday “we are gonna 3-0 c9 and crush everyone at worlds”
see pins
i was charging it and totally forgot about it
hmph
trynig to get boltor prime now
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
what skarm
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
maybe
they weren't very easy essays either
food poisoning is just buckets of fun at kfc
i didnt do any of that yesterday anyway
taco time
im with you gummy
can i have any leftover tacos?
mission so far successful
i agree
thats where we get tacos
cavalry charges
did someone say tacos
what are the reqs?
complete a survival mission with level 30 or higher enemies without killing anyone
a massacre
ahh i see kugal has discovered the internet
i just don't know if the mod itself is good
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
i'm in the mission
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i prefer that
i havent been paying attention
much easier
this does not bode well
nope
darn
trippy smooth version
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
flights
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
be nice flubs
i hated mike and a little bit of zven and mithy
though i rather c9 go to worlds
four to seven pages
anyways brb playing aatrox
yeah
my physics teacher said he likes how he picks on me and i just roll with it
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
nice
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
well who knows maybe i deserve it
nobody does
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
oh cool so the new 2000 series cards are a waste of time
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
ah, gotcha
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can’t buy and have no use for
they also have metal
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
rona is better
so you can find what you want, write it down, and then buy it from somewhere specialized
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
it's torture
sure
gummy be nice to the hardware stores
write about a space ninja
![]==[]
chuck*
i should clean out the pins one of these days
and drago can be a guest on the show
previews are nice sometimes
as a computer engineer my solution to problems is usually rebooting, blaming the programmers, or throwing more resources at it
like e!kill but cheese
maybe you could try loading it into a water pistol
e!wolfram 13 gmt
he comes every two weeks
~~good point.~~
i had someone in my server thinking the nazis were good...how does this happen in a non public server
i googled it and wish you luck draco bc i wouldn’t know how it’d go together either
let people major how they wanna major
how was i supposed to know drago
i don’t want
oh the history major thing
it's like forcing a biologist to write a paper on physics
balls javascript doesnt have a `choose` function
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
who had the changed
it missed obviously.
i dont even like _one_ -page essays
but still
tmw your code doesnt work all afternoon and you finally figure out why
i'm in the middle of figuring out how to use the wikipedia api to generate content for my homework assignment for me
firefox > chrome anyways
i got 1 fact wrong on my astronomy lab and that dropped the grade by 10%
for three hours
and they sell for more typically
yall wanna run an axi s3 radshare
nothing
ham is gross
when i met him i was more successful
i remember back in 2nd grade i really liked ham and cheese sandwiches
i can't believe i got all of ember's stuff in the minimal possible runs
lemonade
fuck
oh yeah that one was hard
it's true, grades k - 8th i literally didnt know anything
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
oh hell no
yea if you're getting a phd you're basically saying you want to stay in school until you're like 30 +
often 8 +
i’m not into the camera work at aaaaallll
my mom went back to school at 36
go for it
or editor
remember stay single and don’t do hard drugs
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
ha ha
im not single
drago
there is tension
gotta do 5 waves with objective taking no damage on lvl 30+
hah. time zones.
woo 100% on astronomy test
kavat cudes up rn if you need them
damn sleep
or maybe just that boy with the hat
i did use a spreadsheet to check myself though
youd need like 15 of them though
it's the sylveon pfp
how is that going?
too bad i still have no idea how to get bacon in this game
i want the frame for myself but im probably not gonna go all out like for rhino
first day of fall and it should be 90+
just get my sister to entertain her
what
25th
she is sick though
:dragonitewasamistake:
my irl sister caught a cold
but then again driving on li looks horrible
unfortunately the people who do drunk driving and road rage also happen to be the people who are least likely to give up their keys
sorry to hear that flubs
~~wasn’t the internet always stupid?~~
same
i just gave you a much better name for it
im guessing itd just be the factorial of the factorial of the original number
through x^.5 form or?
man one assignment for literature takes a few solid hours, its impressive
author master
don’t know yet
yea i think i may just use double factorial
yeah but being an author is risky and dependent on success
good idea
i’ve come to realize i’d rather be happy and doing what i like than be unhappy and dreading work everyday
i should teach kids war
who?
oh yeah peaceful places
play them my songs in return
how the fuck will more music help me hear less music
stellacor
i’ll let you know
gummy dont you have anything better to do
probably
what are your pc specs?
basically i am gonna take everything i learn over the years for this
no, flubs is the demolition expert
no joke
i had curly fries
but i have stat work
im docking your pay until you improve
wait is it without getting detected or
oh that's easy
on a closed interval
i ran ivara stuff way too much
its a t3r3 low chance drop
3 teralysts, one gantalyst, and one hydrolyst
iirc i got pretty lucky with t3
pluto junction here i come
after 7 more missions than shouldve happened
very appropriate
i have a key left if you two want to use it
i remember watching nsmb walkthroughs when i was like 7
that being said i am going to buy a 3ds when i get a job
i started watching during pokémon diamond
it's actually not
it's my sister's
thanks!
that's really sad
win + x -> u -> r
wait switch _is_ ninth gen
ya gotta believe
nice
imagine paying $2000+ for a phone and still not getting a fast charger
i didnt eat lunch today
i dont think mac users breathe
oh wait my sub expired
what the crap it's autumn now?
yeet selling out is awesome
well thats why we call it a raspi usually
you don't
there are phones that cost over $2000?
wow this is.. a lot
i say to the canadians in the room
its just slush
not looking forward to walking to the bus stop in -20 weather tho
winter time is magfest time but im pretty sure thats just because winter coincides with when the convention center is cheapest
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
no squid would be playing it on a smart window
the people you go on discord with
that takes skill
to mot
something bad happen
there we will find the next step of the story
i nearly died
someone told me to go to sleep
allows you to take an aura like corrosive projection
zenurik is super strong energy regeneration
and now that you can hunt teralysts you also have arcane buffs to start collecting
what's the challenge?
it’s cool that they gave a riven
gonna try to sleep now
sounds fun
like +30% strength
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
you say that like it's a good idea but then you realize steam games take a month to patch/download there
as per usual
i think you mean a shit ton
assuming the butt is predominantly meat with a small layer of fat
guys
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
minus the "social" part
gonna go watchwestwing();}
on every site
they can *do* that?
i thought windows used ntfs
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
that's what "formatting" means right
how long is break time?
break time
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
now i want to google "corrosive font" and see what comes up
i dont think this one has a right answer
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
rates of change and other not-exciting stuff
make what a thing
byebye pins
i sent the prof an email about it too
and when you die it stops being your problem
is that good or bad
mines on the top
<:rooduck:399827506665881600>
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
im sleepy
it's all mems
as you know, fred
basically
woah
that was master's bad idea not mine
they're an emerging marketplace right now
actually
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated
yes yes yes yes
16,318,782
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
i still don’t get why they are a thing
rc have you even _seen_ this guy's content
i love the 18th century
bella they dont even have guns they arent the smartest folk
but like how dont they have guns in skyrim
yeah but how was i supposed to know that
gouda?
thank you
wow they have analytics from the 20s?
sweden is a myth
great, now i'm tempted to watch crash course videos for the rest of the night
no notifications except for the guy who i'm trying very hard to avoid
ahoy
damn i want to do that now
oh yeah in dark brotherhood questline you murder the emperor while hes on his ship
master know anyone who hates receiving letters?
thats probably how the fcc feels about public comments tho too
virginia tech? yeah they sent me recruiting information well into my twenties also
also my nose runs
oh i forgot that i blocked mee6
wack
indeed.  welcome to our little slice of discord.
my first class gives quizzes exactly at the start.. it sucks
take the easy option in this case
glad to see everyone doing well
i love this
they both are bad
another essay due in english already <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
oh yeah and we had a mini argumentative piece in gov that most people wrote over a page for. i wrote half a page talking out of my ass and got 6/6 on it
that sounds cruel and unusual
no thanks i just ate two slices of terrible pizza
get the dynamite
vote'); drop table candidates --;
bella want some terrible pizza? the school cafeteria has more of it than they know what to do with
it's cold therefore it's christmas
sounds good
i remember we got papers or something about it in high school but i never read them
>implying there's anything else to talk about
this whole mornings real odd
then again
exactly
hey theres plenty other things to talk about
maybe if you throw it fast enough you can knock out the power cord or something
ida battle drago pls and destroy him!
very badly
is the new 3ds worth?
but then it starts becoming unpredictable
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
with or without the viking swords
wanna learn history?
for a certain time
i did a really good typo earlier
and there are no paper cartridges
nothing im interested in
but you physically copies are nice for display
video games
is this like part of your morning routine or something
thats a first of those
humans are nice
post with a dog in it -> search by controversial
well i got home at 3
*sends dragonite to russia* time to get up
gummy im bored wanna battle
huh, don’t see it
thanks
greetings all those who are kind
i can inv you
take out camera because its kinda funny
hello person
i did this problem last night
brb pretending to be productive today
me thinks problem is flawed
> question 56
or you could say a= -2/x
but if any math nerd can give me their input on that problem #56 *cough* master *cough* spazzer *cough* when you can that'd be great
but is it differentiable?
so the first piece and second piece should have the same derivative value at x = 0
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war
a friend and i were discussing nintendo's new paid online
gum might get to study overseas
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
you arent allowed to touch the penguins
well if the context of the conversation is "hey dont plow our house down"
or maybe penguins can study gummyology
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
too late doing calc first
the classes are way tougher than film
gummy what do you _do_ with a film degree anyway
film editor or producer for tv shows before moving on to movies or animation
i already am complaining about college
community moreso when you wanna transfer... those reqs are no joke
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it’s the same thing
that’s awesome
ring theory is that if something is round and goes on a finger its probably a ring
i took chem as a senior
i mean people in grade 12
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
final*
i think the highest for freshman here is bio
well that’s easy
im in such a good mood
oh gummy _is_ the detention teacher
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
i should probably tag him hun
it's so cool and easy too
as long as you're careful, rock and roll
is that a good thing or a bad thing
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
it’s normal probably
you have no valid point
because i do the dumb
well, have fun
it’s not surprising, but official
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question
a high male voice in choir
i got chewed out in first grade
should have learnt french instead
i have poems to read. hopefully
@someone else, set it up to ping me whenever someone says gay
ccongrats
i still think nintendo should have their own site/system like loveroms and emuparadise with netflix style payments or something to play older games
leave'er johnny leaver ohh leaver johnny leavr. for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
a special fuck you to the guy who looked right at me while i was downed vs the gustrag three in a nitain mission and didn't revive me
and it's time for us to leave her
oh look it's ten pm and ive done nothing useful today
~~always bring plasmor~~
legitimate question: what's wrong with using a ternary operator?
felix is hot tbh
it's 2 am here
goof off in the computer lab by making a program to dispense random calvin and hobbes quotes when called.
i wanna be a teacher so i hate myself
you have no clue what i want do you?
you could give it all to me
so is paint
the ones with the really fuckin annoying names
gummy you know you can just use an elgato for that right
the yellow part not the 0.7k part
whats an fhat
no im flubs
then let me go play minecraft in peace damn it
melee riven from my sorties
anyone want to go in my place?
i'm about to go into ap physics for 80 mins are you sure you want to switch?
a new game called war of rights
bought tigris build for 80 plat, some trading later am back up to 200
how is that stupid?
she's on the phone with the manager who's out of country rn
i rolled for it like 20 times
someone needed a lex prime reciever
...  i think i just spent a half hour looking at a fish

almost all research is done, shadow clan
none of that matters why the fuck would you put that in your resume to literally everything
yeah. didn’t know that actually
also this is happening
jupiter
me and my big mouth
3450 i think
sitting is comfortable and rising is hard
let the chaos begin in three, two, one . . .
but reddit steals from 4chan and twitter and twitter steals from reddit. and we all know to stay far far away from 4chan so where is the purest meme source?
rise up stormcloaks
rip i returned to stream gone
im retiring as of 5 hours ago
good
if it was easy everyone would do it
is it bad that i bought the skyrim ost almost four years ago and im still not tired of it
you can do that in real life too
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again
i like it when my code is a metaphor for my entire life
"and here we have dragonite getting his eleventh hour of sleep"
also is it bad that nintendo sent me an email about a pokémon distribution and the pokémon in the picture was completely unrecognizable
the large one
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
good job
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
thats the boy
the forecast calls for an undefiend chance of dragonite showing up to stream tonight
okay so that didnt go well
snorlax
actually it's from the enlightened# channel
yeah, i should've known that joke would fall flat
the who?
we just have the tallest house on the block
@drag see subreddit
last i checked thanos helped us clear what was left of their spies out
the homeowner association subreddit?
i thought it was unusually sane in here but i assumed that squid just left the window open again
should've used ragnar the red
no it would probably be the timestamp of the last time the page was edited
it's their 10 year anniversary but it all has to go under $25
but how long will libraries actually stay open with the internet existing?
but it's halloween in a month
extreme cheap cake?
the discordie one sucks?
oh yes i just don't have mods revolting against me i also have a non mod wanting to take over my server and call it gummyland 2.0
yeah
it keeps fuckin changing
but i must get enough money if i wanna see my gf
i assume that is good?
and slap this one girl at bronycon i hate
#define define //
that...doesnt make sense
lies
it was in my photo album for too long, can finally free up that storage
and nitain
okay then

i was gonna get new york but they only had 12 oz
well
i almost always get some vegetables with steak orders

i got my feedback on my essay map
too dark; can’t see the other wall. start over <:kappa:374346980136058893>
warframe is good tho

how in the hell do i start learning programming

<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
my friggin college calculus course is easier than my high school honors course
> essay
but it's due monday
the great thing about physics is that you don't need words for it to make sense
and i was never told to start working on it, only that it was due monday
"here's a template lab that someone turned in in 2007, just copy and paste some words and add a table of your results and write me two sentences for why your results don't match mine and you get a 95"
the directions are equal to "ok go and do it have fun!"
yeah that's pretty much what's in all of the lab files i still have lmao
my favorite part is when you catch the black hole at just the right angle and you can see an image of yourself without needing a mirror
like spaghetti or people
also what the fuck how do teachers have enough time to grade all this stuff and still make tests and shit
i know only of blitzypoo
squid if you die i get your stuff
alright cool
where are you?
i dont see pictures and i thought for a second...
yeah
no but that's a good idea
quick put on the spookyrim image
so lost my gf and a lot of people
i been noticing my mood changing quick
ghosts dont scare me they make me feel safe
maybe a bone doctor or whatever theyre called
problem is idk how to get one
well she was the only one i knew who watched
do what is right for you countrymen
nerds

stahp
gummy take him gambling
damn i was close

sounds like a plan
while idk my relationship status with my gf i can safely confirm ida is the older sister i always wanted
well i am happy for some reason
i could get things done or i could play skyrim
older sisters are hot in anime
you can have my little sister
jk jk
but i also looked up to him so that was nice
okay no wonder my peanut butter is wet
i realize something
i still have to redo the entire physics essay too <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
>: (
for now
it's always supposed to be raining somewhere
and the ones for linux are . . . entertaining
other than that they expect me to find out really specific details that only websites like yahoo answers or quora seem to know
then at the end they had me describe two proposed methods of interstellar travel, and talk about the concept of warp drive which was probably honestly the easiest part becuase a lot of websites actually agreed ont he information
coffee sucks <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i could not find a single answer
i could not agree more
ask them to double check that they didn't give you ap astronomy homework
dragonite happy
did the disable expiration spell break?
people who like coffee
i just feel like this list is missing a few things
i have one question
wait did i fucking say that my knees are above the knees?

wasn't sure if it was canonical or not
saturn
i was just surprised
thanks this is confusing panda
i mean this wouldn't be the first time he's attempted to save something
they really should qa test these things better
urgent question: is everclear safe to drink
because i have some and want very desperately to be not sober
and that worked out fine without it (?)
i had a physics essay for breakfast this morning
mine is usually somewhere between -100 and 5000
mix it with koolaid
cutting everclear with water?
it can range up to 13, but that's uncommon
i've been doing that for the past four years.
right

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
it's not because women are more emotional

im pretty sure if you read enough bible you could find at least one or two instances of god being a knob to jesus
it's like that but an anime
oh hey
what is the truth
10/10
of course gummy loves the soviet era
my sympathy has been replaced with contempt
dragonite dont do it now
he prefers when women were disallowed a voice
.....

alright fair
its fuckin gross
whoossat
but its nice
that sounds like a bad ainime
great so header formatting doesnt work on discord i want a refund
creative writing and essay shouldn’t be in the same sentence
then there's no way to get a refund.
even though i’m not bad at formal essays, doesn’t mean they’re enjoyable
so refund your nitro subscription.``` <:kappa:374346980136058893>
found the perfect efficiency point
and i’m doing nothing because i’m tired after a day of work

i thought there were like
that might have been a different game though but im pretty sure it was xenoblad

silver 2 21 lp
can we hit gummy
he’s gummy as well
this is so sad

my dad sucks
so i stopped doing it

<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
and then you take us to anime off-brand ice-cream-princess, distinctively not dairy queen

nvm i just uh <:rooderp:399827526744014848>

purple is weird on you
at least i think that's the case, i don't know. i'm not a dentist or an orthodontist
what is your weapon?
solution: get rid of all the teeth
your body clearly hates it
uninstalling skyrim is illegal
no dragonite is dragonite and gummy is gummy
yeah people tend to leave when dragonite shows up
good idea

you put all your info on a google doc and share it with the corporate email. the entire email
also a lot of the point of school is broadening your horizons and also teaching you to not be an asshole. it fails on both fronts, but you cant really fault them for trying
well knowing them yes, paying for them, no
can you use a microwave?

there's the broken wikipedia thing
skyrim says hi
e!github
esp group c
like what
i wonder if i can ping a channel with `<@#num>`
hmmm
like uesp for when the power goes out
eggnog is so good

yummy
great, now i’m hungry
why are you kicking gummy into the stratosphere
have any idea?
where are the words and/or characters missing in the document?
though honestly, haven’t come across that problem
i'd suggest just throwing it on google drive
okay, this is going to sound weird but hear me out.
he doesn’t
so would that mean like all of his 2869 lines of spaghetti get randomly recombined with someone else's 2869 lines of spaghetti or something
\:thinking\:
is it about skyrim
we're fucked
whats the most outer space sounding song in skyrim

you need a permit until 18 or passed drived

i saw someone post it on twitter a week or so ago but i have no idea what to search for it
i sacared someone into thinking i was givin them malewar by going on there
one more hour till thanksgiving
consider it a rebellion against the smartphone era
the stuff in it is kind of important but the words inside it are like
yeah let's not
balls i need to go to class
when your computer freezes and theres nothing in the event log about it
ironic as they want to reduce language as much as possible in there
idk if this should be here or memes but lo;
also not putting ig first in d lul
it probably has something to do with an unknown component near the back-lower-right of the computer tower spitting sparks at me the other day
great ida
they now legally have to unban you
gummy when did google shut you down
today im even more happier
i just have those correct button things on my phone
but now it will be gone
that pinged me
i will
hey i know what i should do

yay windows
and if you continue youll be inclined to waste even _more_ of your time
so you say youtube videos are fun while streaming is a waste of time while ida says youtube videos are a waste of time but streaming is fun
rip ida
sorry to hear that
you mean there are people who _dont_ show their passport when asked for id
if you want to be a full time streamer prepare to literally never have more than one or two days off
master do you even know the words to ragnar the red
also you can't argue with your viewers
that depends on the streamer
kix once banned someone for copy pasting a question over and over until someone answered. it was great
since if you just ban every person who insults you you're going to have no viewers left
i stream because im bored
yeah i agree
was i guess
i just need 15 more followers and that 3 average views
people are sleeping on ig tbh
you told me to listen to baba yetu
so i did
baba yetu is cool
and saw muskets in it
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
it was on history and napoleon
good
good job squid
hmmm
in xenoblade theyre all like "oh i like pie, go get me fifty pies"
i did a loan thing
~~more reason to not like xc~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
honestly, watching an lp of it, i do like some of the story and character stuff. but, i’m still not going to play it myself
but gf had an unexpected bill
no because i dont expect this back
actually a lot of siege streamers dont put up with people being douches in chat and i find it really funny
do you want to tell him or
it's my gf flubs
i mean he does get usage of a twitch emote in return for subbing
if she doesn't pay me back you can tell me i told you so
acrobat reader can die in a fire
so gummy why couldnt she afford whatever the fuck
i guess we will see what happens in the future
i have to read thoreau and all he's doing is contradicting himself
darn
keep being you
im sorry
just code triple battles and then copy paste it but subtract 1
good
or maybe pokémon battle royale
and bella let me know once you watch
it's only like 95% broken
i don't remember what it is but i know i played it before 14 days of shitstorm
even if my pickems don't reflect that.
and not to the extent that i cant out exercise it
ignore that big bad statement
yeah but less than eating so i go  with that one
drago
join so i can make fun of you
had a customer that was a pain to deal with; pretty sure he was high. i could tell from his eyes and that he gave off strong fumes that smelled like spray paint that made a couple of us not feel well. and he came through 3-4 times.
just do the thing that makes the thing move to you
then we are safe
viagra, aka primed continuity
nice
good afternoon
not even close.
i’m so glad there’s no quiz on thoreau.. so i didn’t totally waste my time reading 50+ pages. that would’ve sucked
i probably killed the spelling. my apologies
amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, taking the form of a wolf.
so isn’t amaratsu a dog or a fox?
i’m going to give you my honest opinions on whatever the subject is. that’s just me. so i hope that doesn’t interfere in future convos that we may have in the future
so i need to understand that others do the exact same thing.
i had a strange feeling you were gonna be easy to get along with
so now that we got that squared away. are you into makoto shinkai movies?
gift*
youtube is my primary source of entertainment.
do you see it?
you mean they pricing?
on cn
yup.
i remember i caught half of one episode and never saw it again.
i hate those letters too <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i watched pokemon and that's it
oi vey
i can miss obvious jokes sometiemes.
if i see someone rob an apple store does that make me an iwittness?
i could tell
he's just such a kind, genuine guy
well he does have a lot of 3dses.
i really wanna do it
i could be googleing this but wheres the fun in tjat
one*
im here
stuff ice in those clothes
ooh yay
youtube has given me yet more tools to help quantify how my channel is failing
lps?
oh so it also turns out that these new tools are somewhere between nonfunctional and hopelessly broken
hes got like 2 million subs
ive never applied online but ive only ever applied to one job and that ended pretty poorly because i got the job
plus or minus the global human population
nope
it will be organization for yt
brb kicking self off phone
congrats flubs
good organization
it was 4 years ago idfk
god is
im bored
geeks
creeps
and babies
i'm sleepy
sadly
mmm, how so
bc like when people speak to me and i’m not like prepared enough i get clumsier
you ran—oh that dragonite
i want whoever told me that fired
my resume is literally a text file with four-space tabs thats a good way to get a job right
i typically always see/write month first
ddmmyyyy is little endian
no the others are stupid because why should i change the way i write the date
how is month first stupid
oh right
it is in canada
i’m surprised year first is actually a thing
they were sitting around 32-33 dollars a share a few weeks ago now theyre at like
i mean whats the point of life if you dont get to invoke a little society-sized catastrophe now and again
its the execution that gets you in trouble
base twelve would be awesome
yeah
also theres nothing illegal about *wanting* to pour boiling hot water down someones throat
and i mean im bad with people
what is the work
just so yall know im aqua
you aren’t
i hate it there
not bad
is that good or bad
or maybe it isnt
cccccccccccccccc
maybe it's a toy car
today i am gonna destroy something
it's an acquired skill
so we just played against trick2g
bella youre an octopie
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<:gwomoraphiohmy:405784196783538196>
yeah, it's the one that melts your face off
let's hope not
very kind of you
twilight princess link - - in ocarina of time! ^^^^^^^
i want gen and afreeca out of groups
1-1 against each other
like i think that game should have been rated r
well friends, i feel like you ought to know
travel time says no
well shit there goes like half of my opinions
true
now we're asking the real questions
i shall be spending my weekend watching these vods
con: youre a villain so you had to kill it
why do people out smart me?
could go for some more pizza tho
benny ate it while gummy was watching him
i’ll also take some pizza, thank you
i like integrals and pizza
it's basically an approximation that gets better and better and you can write it out to a greater accuracy than your calc
plus im not positive that newton's method can approximate all points
windows wants to update and is giving me the option to do it either now or now
skarm say brb
yay windows
*throws waffle out the squid that was* etc.
dragoknit
why is base12 good?
great now i feel like googleing dumb things about base systems and seeing what i get
as minimalist as you can make a hyperlink
0.5 obviously
dont you mean "assymptote"
ask flubs
i forget probably
(that probably wasnt original dont shoot me)
squid because theyre spooky and it was dark and october
you had an interesting week two months ago
drago
then it aint the end
you rang
go back to sleep
hey want me to be your anivia coach?
though i play too much ranked these days
leason
link pls
but other people
(the vod session's tomorrow)
i assume you meant follow
following does nothing though
only reason i do it is because i can do this <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466> or <:raritysmile:447196778517757978>
tbh i never actually care about converting people to bronies just for jokes but i still converted someone
also is it bad
actually the animation is very similar to anime
talking to me is great ida
speaking of warlike and destructive, you would make a great fit for eimm
good thing i left that server when i did
i have 0 chill and i'll have you know
and they don’t ban
i usually lurk and don’t care
kick/ban
you just fuckin called me dan
i'm so lonely
so it’s worse now
of course we don’t always have pony talk but you get the picture
again?
~~i just assume everyone who isn’t here at the time is out actually doing something with their lives~~
my server is dead, two pony servers are too noisy
oh wait my power is back so i can toilet again
only one?
go away let me browse reddit
how about
i said batman and robin > the dark knight
we all do
i love how ida is instantly terrified when she join
you are gross
benny likes you sober
but you probably shouldn't mod me as soon as i join or anything
im watching a stream and either the bf is being abusive or its a way of an affection
do you have like some sort of godly alcohol tolerance or something
who else is gonna take him bowling?
um 5'7" 115 lbs
yay its midnight and i just spent like two hours trying to figure out why i was getting the wrong output when i was giving the computer the wrong input
flubs!!!
you are a turtle
on top of spaghetti all covered in cheese, i lost my poor meatball when somebody sneezed, it rolled off the table and onto the floor, i lost my poor meatball as it rolled out the door
cheese is life
i like mozzarella
its okay i like cheese enough for both of us
~~=v=~~
yep i wasnt notified lul
then we roll them down a hill
as do i
i feel like i've missed a lot
you haven't missed anything, lol.  i've been biding my time, adjusting to my new job and i'm ready to kick back into the streaming world
we'll always be here for you man
but i believe they are another type of number, in 4 dimensions
and they look like i j k l or soemthing like that, i cant remember
a king isn't a king with out his supporters.
i'd have to re-watch that 3blue1brown vid on em
but there are
it was this
i never looked at the old one
what are the orange dots
nice, you updated these on stream too then?
granted twitch makes it hard because they always change their damn rules when it comes to how images fall below the stream
love the new icon 💗
i want to do some housecleaning on this server too, but that's another day's project
again, another day's project
hey guys how long has the server picture been different without me noticing
5 minutes maybe
that last one has been that way for a month now
is that the protonjon head with dragonite antennae
even if his best if fuckin trash
no cupcake for you come to stream
my guess would be homestuck or something.
they have two prongs instead of just the one
we'll go with that.
victori in game
oh look streams still going on i should probably poke my head in there or something
its an anime thing
amazo
can benny be my roommate for this hotel?
what is ash's worst pokemon battle?
my dog has bigger spots on her right side than on her left side
welp
it's called blue steak
he didnt even look at the damn directions on how to complete the assignment
exactly, theyre always annoying self-centered asses
not typically, no, not safe
kugal right click on the guy
kugal ive been in that situation and the person is never fuckin worth it. also they usually dont even learn
you should read the directions on how to complete the assignment before taking up 4 hours of your fellow student's time
thats fair
kugal tell him that this is your alt account and point him to me as your main one
i feel like with all the diversity there is on the internet, ,there's bound to be one person who says that seriously
im gonna get too depressed
so when he shows me his screen and what he needs help with, everything is in german
he's been offline for a few hours, so its been pretty peaceful
r value is 1-1e-12
and part of me doesnt want to because i still have to see him in class everyday and i dont want him to give me shit for blocking him
i need a full size version  of it to comprehend
also its probably a lot easier to have adult intervention offline if they see it happening
3 day weekend for me
that works too
thats not dickish at all
the last day of that class was awesome
in college its full of people who are millions times more humble and they're just more real
the only thing i like/miss from high school is being with the handful of people i actually liked
well, int hat class anyway
oh shit that reminds me
not the one i expected you to pin
thats dumb
ive reached the point where i believe theres some bottomless box of emotes but how do you find the ones you need
yeah remembering an infinite set must be a swell time
we did it
or just relevant ones.
ok then i dont which is good
dern
would you like me to create another dab
birthday punch!
it's today
is that like an off brand falcon punch?
candy is secondary

shu todoroki from cars 2

i just finished the second episode of telltales the walking dead’s final season and i’m bummed now
im no bandwagoner
people won’t make fun of c9 for getting an “easy” group or skt carrying them out
also gummy sure we can collab, you can be the punching bag

we both dressed up as the scariest thing we can think of
after halloween
i hate things right now *throws squid out of the pumpkin patch*
i just got demoted from silver 4 and my first game after that i go 4/0/21 on braum

you are a boat
tm94
let me look this up
he would get to battle the fat kid

sun and moon
sup pals
now i only have 6 courses to worry about
i wish
r i s e
because you can never know for sure if they *arent* poisonous, but if you learn that they are you know
i've read a few *comics* about that
the fuck is a district
flubs why is everyone living in the place most vulnerable to hurricanes
some places overlap too its great
its a piece of a state that has a senator
when i was a kid my next door neighbor had a different zip code and phone area code
great now i spent 12 minutes reading about nassau the island instead of finishing homework
its got all the good restaurants in the sound
oh cool apparently the sound had d+ water ecosystem health when i was a kid
master my code isnt working help

no you could have tell it was him
i half-ass both
i want to understand things i don't understand, but then i would understand why people are dumb. but then again that's self explanatory. screw that
im not sure if i just complimented you or insulted you
open it
that includes pens, pencils, pencil lead, a notebook, some note flags, and i got 2 things that werent school related
~~yeah, just ignore that last message of mine~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
and then make the boxes into a *larger* box
i had no school today yet i still did some school work
thinkinator always helps
just join him and he'll eventually stop
gummy wanna write my code for me
four little slices of salami rolled up with enough horseradish inside to make me not hungry
is it hard to use a keyboard with panda hands though
gummy if i went to bronycon i might only come out on my way to the coroner
sorta
this doesnt help it hinders at best
also gummy ill be your bodyguard if i get to wear dark sunglasses and an im with stupid shirt
according to healthline.com, cooling the blood vessels can reduce the amount of blood that leaks into the surrounding tissue, which can prevent the bruise from being as apparent and reduce swelling.
god what the fuck why do people always say put ice on bruises and shit
is that a politics joke
then how would anyone know
since i played skyrim
you go ahead, i'm just going to save ice complaints for winter anyway
wats dat?
flubs i didnt know you were into thermodynamics
the law of conservation of momentum is what keeps dragonite's butt in a chair all day
i learnt yesterday ida edits better than me
im making a sick 3d model
yeah and also
if they can't adapt, they deserve to lose
draco im reporting you to the humane society
if you even have to ask
aight then we good
ooh look im rainy im functional
just listen to your body,if you pinched a blood vessel by sitting wrong your vision could easily go dark for an extreme amount of time without any repercussions
hours
how about this
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
how do you spell the word for "assure" that sounds like garrin-tiid i k ow it has a lot of unnecessary us and as and es
that sounds like an organ
i just have a compulsion when it comes to those red squiggles
alright tell me now
bai rainy <:roocry:399827523011084298>
i just realized i've watched chugga for ~half my life
the dent is because my skull didnt fuse right when i was a baby
my mom is an emoji
dragonite pick a language

my head hurts from looking at a screen all day or something im going to go to bed or something
cannot beat legends never die
outside probably closer to 3

my history professor is amazing
i am proffessjonal analist
yeah it’s a lot to deal with.
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
i put on a vr headset once and it was like
budget cuts for eample.
hello
but there are some that do a good job about it.
you'll keep it
i just finished the little game thing and immediately had to get out
people got even more confused
fair enough
history teacher made a debate room in class
today i learn you don’t get 6 tattoos of the person you love and that you shouldn’t propose after one month of datig
don’t you wanna come to the wedding?
i thought she was one of the normal-ish ones
im surprise ida knows who that is
could you wait like 20 years to move in with each other first then
i hate them
its in the name though
do you want to be married?
like there's so many other things you can use that money for
there is nothing innovative or new about it. i might as well play a less buggy, lower netcode pubg with powerups
and they have a low level of entry but high skill ceiling
i don’t know any decent person <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but dual wielded
vortex is dead
maybe i should lol
and i was on a podcast with a guy who has 60k subs. not sure how many people watched it; he doesn’t get many people watching his videos anymore
return my vision and you can have one
but my social life been boomin recently and i just dont have much chill time anymore
which im immune to
nobody at work knows tho
also it supports out skyrim supports voiced languages like polish and japanese and stuff. i should set my language to that and see if i can still understand anything.
and theyre hazy as fuck even with my glasses on
i'm alive
<:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
it could potentially be c9 vs fnc in semis
i didnt diss it
youd think there was a bunch of dust in there or something but there isnt

never go stormrazor its shit on her
yep, that's how uni is
tbh i haven’t seen any college kid smoke

i have to remember how to classify plants that i was totally listening to last week
yeah
guys i think i hate xml.
i knew it
i think so
when does supper happen then
and flubs you would not like this person
gummy is that how you go around meeting new people
"hello my name is gummy, do you like the emoji movie?"
probably not
whatever you are but in irl
then my life is complete
now just gotta find an irl flubs
you can do that
what's this about my toaster
schools overcharge, hooray
i can get a slice of pizza at school for 2.65 but it doesnt taste very good
she dies
i don’t want to say specifically for spoilers but oh my god
why would that be exciting for me lol
there’s only a couple shows where that’s ok
its a special arrangement of only the finest ~~volatile death orbs~~ vitamin rich frenchless unfrieds
you should go look at it youll be even more disappointed in me than before
dang
just say potatoes for gummy and theyll know
well yeah. its cod. thats to be expected. shitty, but expected
dont bully me ill tell mom
so far your friend’s not bad
errr nooo
fight my enemies yes
it’s not good to have lol
considering i don’t think you’ve had this chain before i’d be ok with that
(this is totally not based off of a stackoverflow question i saw a little while ago)
i’m an east coast boi because i live here and don’t travel
i'm right on the edge basically
that's because california is weird
burgers for dinner is good
and if i flirt with her punch me hard
how sweet
gummy how could you
yes you are
time stops love
flubs hates everything
you 3 all hate everything
ultimate power move. it shows you think less of her than she thinks of you, that you definitely saw the gift, and dont care about her gift or need the balls
hmm i dont feel like working on game but i dont feel like nto working on game help
flubs ruin my day pls
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
time to buy prime junk
your dog is dead
first and only day for my new job and i crushed my knees getting there
i need like 3-4 of those
did it feel like you knew what you were doing?
instead of saying like 6200 ft² per second i accidentally said in my head 6200 ft / s² and thought that was ok
but the littlest part of me is expecting like 13/20 or something
or did you feel like batman?
we're only  touching a tiny bit on integration but im like amazing at integration, so that's little worry to me
damn
flubs
since we're still in q1 here
because i dont fully understand them
go to your room
no cussing young man
oh wait vulkar wraith is
alright i got the two most important ones
im honestly thinking about it
i do not insist
and make that annoying dragon that spawns by the college turn into a pile of living chickens on death
no job does not consist mainly of doing nothing. just look busy and you wont get more work
wanna hear a joke?
my love life
hmm there's one section where one of the graybeards uses a gendered pronoun when talking about the player character, i wonder if they correctly change it if you play as a girl or if they just assume nobody would notice
no just like both of them
i didnt say marry both
i just realized the ck logo and bethesda logo are basically the same thing
gummy youre officially looking for trouble and i'm hereby granting permission to interpret everything that you say as a rumination on cheese
as a general rule if your message was successfully submitted to a server and it later disappears, the solution is not "post it again"
aight
im not looking for trouble
i don’t want it to work like that
looks like the only boss frames i need now are mesa, atlas, and nekros
usually, though
i feel like im cheating
i can kinda see that
it was like after 40 mins in before 48
i might be able to, but not quite right now
sorry
i think i still used my lato at the time
i was using lex prime
market
hello there
join gummy in this week college adventure
welcome
guys i think skyrim is a singularity
i guess i should think about doing something with my life now huh
well from my perspective, a full time job may help since it's more consistent in terms of hours.  though i'm not certain.
i fell asleep at 6 last night
i couldn’t stay asleep for that long unless you killed me
i slept for 14 hours but woke up early
what does that mean
i just got done playing skyrim 15 minutes ago
and you don’t have it on your switch or pager or rock
whenever i press a on a door nothing happens
there's not only just one first seed left after quarterfinals
at most
if they have anything cheesy prepared
afs probably knows about it
g2 was weaker
play skyrim
i have become crazy
just return it
so basically if i do end up with this new girl she is cool that we breakup
that's $50,000 an hour and you've been here for at least thirty seconds
since im in a good mood
im going to go pet my dog brb
dragonite what flavor of dog do you have
because some aspects of programming are more complex than rocket science.
maybe a shiba
i kind of want to know what would happen if you set up a battle with like five hundred participants using my code
most bittersweet shit ever lmao
next question
20 or 40?
im in
k back
welp there goes 10k focus

i can’t give up on league when i never played it in the first place <:kappa:374346980136058893>
(the thing the kass did was accuse me and my duo of being toxic when we'd barely used the chat and he'd flamed my duo for the entire game)
which, to be fair
fucking ask her

obs studio for pc. if anything else, you’re screwed <:kappa:374346980136058893>
its fine in sandwiches but doesnt work well in ice cream or candy imo
fuck yeah
i love arthur
it’s the stupid booming ones too
your grandma's a command prompt
are the dodgers in the playoffs or something
or they just won something
im not currently but now i want to know the answer
thanks im going to get a second opinion on that
hmm ashbot's profile picture is upside-down ash
okay so uh
i hope it's still on da somewhere
no u
thats probably because i reconnected him
gross
he's not upside down youre upside down
they hacking
now, i speedrun games ye?
a really big number like ten to the six
when did it become 10
you are arent you
licorice
i fucking love licorice
not bandwagoning
from the start
fuck tsm
g2 took out rng so they're not a lightweight either
oh yea definitely no clear winner
wtf fnatic
anyone can win
~~now you gotta promise to buy c9 skins if they win worlds~~
~~aqua is now magma.~~
whos aqua
that tells me nothing
5/6 finish in summer
they bad?
of course they aren't bad
compared to before yeah they blow
i rather see them than 100 thieves at worlds
i wonder how long i can avoid being social and work in game today.
the other had a very close series that could have gone either way.
meteos was just a big misunderstanding
rikara did not deserve to go play at worlds at any capacity
they already knew they wouldn't have wom
you be social
long term it may be a better move
im hearing aphro wanted meteos kicked and cody sun out
could make sense though
true
remember what happen to dl on clg
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
obviously rikara was playing in challenger series for one year and academy for most of this year
they could have let him one game since he worked all year to get them to worlds
i'm not at home rn, gotta do homework later
you don't know that
well i think ssumday won't stay
maybe during stream once it gets rolling
flubs
no reason for him to
or you could be neither
i don’t have a brother
its your brother
well shit, how am i supposed to come up with that money?
i have like 3.50 on my desk in loose change that you can borrow
don't look away kugal that number will be orders more the second you check back in on it
i’m back from work ya ninnies. and eyan is streaming
you should probably copy and paste all those as a new e!suggest after getting that important one
i just made the "all required move effects do their job" milestone, the question is, do i keep going or do i finally just play skyrim
gonna do one more run for the night
also maple syrup your username is 10/10
i believe in you
6 runs of derelict survival
the only thing i dont really like much about the class is how some questions we are tested on but arent explained how to do them properly
my profs don’t even let you see questions you missed if you didn’t get to class early enough
i just kinda wish my midterm would get graded already so i can see the horrible score i know i got
i probably didnt score as high as i usually do, but probably not as low as how my toxic mind thought i would
like if i dont show my work in the best way he usually wont care, as long as i came to the right conclusion and he knows its my honest work i get full credit
i havent played skyrim in like ever
i have such a bad problem with self confidence
but should i really?
meet me behind the big trash cans at 2:30
half of my monitors go with me to the soul stone
that still leaves like four or five of them right
bring an xbox controller
dragonite balances out the pros and cons of this but ehh worth
you too
lmao microsoft is still making tts voices
so that fucking joey with 100 metapods doesnt beat you by running you dry on pp
i need to dump some cause im at 14/15 rn
weekly ayatan
the most versatile early game hm keeper in gen 4?
still no octavia
dragonite's just a dork
i use carrier
i mean yeah if i choose arceus or dialga or something i'd just look like an egomaniac
or you stop to scan?
wait a minute what is that
it yelled at me about for loops and turning x degrees already too
that's an amazing username.
unlike computer science, other tasks can be achieved faster as a group effort.
in practice the above is false
the colors are all weird
i should do that
and i wouldn't have met you guys
okay okay
and it's been 5 minutes
12 runs
i'm doing osha training in class and this man just did it to em
i figured it out
me or gummy or both
these are closely guarded doctoring secrets
i feel like i should know this but i only ever got the vaccinations that are necessary to not die
normally yes but when it's you they're smiling at one should probably start worrying for their sanity
is that a good thing or a bad thing
and smelled like perfume
top ten things said before disaster
he will not
that sounds like a euphemism for something to do with the toilet doesn't it
not the first server i saw this in
but on the front page
i got a fiora bug fixed by getting on the front page of r/lol once
i think you’re becoming 
**normal**
now to do it with all the consonants. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
rip i'm sure they'll provide things for you if need be
i have a meeting with a prospective school but there was nothing that was said i had to prepare... so i have no idea what i need
you are my minister of war
sooo i am watching weird things
now there is war
delusional
what fun did i miss
i forgot about that
i mean there wasn't exactly anything stopping them before
plus it ain't exactly hard to fake degrees <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
thats confidene intervals graph type as a whole
just showing off my sprite rendered titanotylopus for zoo tycoon 1
personally i think im pretty great
🎉 good job aminal
good for you fam
like fallout 76.
squid is playing skyrim
my gf broke up with me because i yelled at her because she thought equestria was real
she broke up with me
where is my sister
i am?
and blocked me
i kinda wanna cry
gummy just be like me and be single and complain about it
oh my
new plan
..........
you should do something about it
like
no it doesnt
he has a lot of money
theyre still not part of the game's files though
today
the smoke detector just went off and dragonite's dog.exe has stopped working
you dont hear anyone going "dear ideal masters ill trade you this dark soul gem for a spicy alchemy buff"
they were probably really bad at it where they live like the only thing you can use is chaurus eggs and glowing  mushrooms and i cant imagine either of those things taste very good
ive heard good things about mushrooms
hey man dont judge the dwarves on their cooking techniques
so did the dwarves get yote or just kinda fuck off and stop existing?
incantations are probabaly part of summoning
who knows maybe they evolved to metabolize bronze or something
depends on the topic
that is not a chaurus
it’s the first game i’m actually downloading on steam since i installed it a few days ago
go back to skyrim
well that was a failure.  neexxtt
next question
is dragonite awake _before 10:30 for once?_
that's an uncharacteristically good idea
play skyrim for the 1,000th time
plot twist: you're actually not
daniel gheesling
took a nice nap and now my throat feels like a swarm of infestation
shit up
dan is a good boy who makes good streams. and when he wants to be hes a fucking manipulative mastermind
in other news the wikipedia page of "list of numbers" is pretty good too
it says infinity servings which is amazing
i know right
this is non-negotiable
play it safe and ask in the morning. people interrupting your mindflow is punishable by death
the latter
think it would be safer if i asked an hour later?
actually kinda
not a procrastinator
best wingman ever
youtube shut up im not voting for any of them stop telling me who to vote for
and i thought flubs would talk about the inappropriate stuff again
never heard of it
bendy and the ink machine is scary game
help im watching horror movies tomorrow
theres only one i actually want to see
thats got whats his name
havent seen it
woah
i miss the office. probably going to rewatch it
the office is great
and emily blunt?
i need to watch it first
self control, good job
and i thought i was fast
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
hey i told you my uni friend did her hair and got dressed in 5 mins before class
my hair is too messy
and i thought i was early
pm me
for the past 3 hours
dare i ask why you are on your phone?
but i had to try
ice cream?
you are at the hospital
visiting me?
take a pic of him
yeah i ate a baby
work?
i legit would get mad if someone around me sang that
but it also doesnt
why does that sound familiar
i'll tell you but i highly recommend you never listen to it
this si awful
anyone who disagrees can fight me
but seriously batman and robin is better than the dark knight
mannnn i am so effing pissed with this banner leak guy and the smash community right now
i just looked the lyrics up
i'm pissed btw since sakurai won't get the satisfaction of revealing these characters now because of this leaker showing off all of the remaining characters
maybe
but anyway my rant is over now
if it wasnt intended
welcome!
making sure you're the right guy here btw, is that you flubs?
streams almost done
hey will
other people don't want to be spoiled!
since you don't care about leaks....
just move duh
i agree with bella
the wifi isn't out
wasn't even working on the wired computer
hello kugals
i think wired is as close as you can get
no it was my old flipphone
big enough where i don't fuck up and press another button
i hate phone typing
i only used it for 2 things
i hate touchpads...
well its sketchy as shit
i uninstalled skype
but who gives a fuck its easy to use
i must know these laws
still better than skype
i sort of understand that, my hands were really shaking after playing on my ps3 for a while
hi back *again*
oh that
i have to actually look at what i'm typing if i have to use a touchpad
it isnt even about cold i just have a weird feeling in my hands and wish for it to not be so annoying. if i wear gloves i dont have to put as much pressure on my fingertips
calling the bathroom "the little boy's room"
i remember that
yea he said he had tog o
that one calculator tool i showed you
the what now
oooh
im great at saving money gum
nice
good point
<:roocomfy:399827521253670912>
make peace
especially if you still interact witht he person after the fact
i can't spell
alright lol
you have committed crimes against skyrim and her people
some time in the mines should straighten you out
tell me what he said so i can say it too
but i figured out what the joke was gonna be
did someone steal his sweetroll?
i didn't knock anything off my to-do list today and i just want to go play skyrim instead
the forsworn are nice they have cookies and only try to kill you on some days
woo 100 on stat test
good job gum
nvm gf does not deserve it
that is not a skill in skyrim why would you have a 100 on it
because it's like
idk how females work
kugal be quiet you're like fourteen
hey sis wanna move in with me for a day?
im 20 *and a half*
no that's down the hall and to the right
hi depressed nice to meet you
i am depressed
in skyrim's epilogue odahviing pronounces his own name wrong
oh - dah - ving
understandable
that’s how i was until 2016
flubs
that did not age well.
instead of od - ah - viing like every other npc and the call dragon shout pronounces it
i see someone with a username called gummy. i saw someone like that earlier on some anime server.
welcome \:)
lies
no stick pls
hop to
last time it was scary
what was the snapchat of
thats going in the sub

me me me!
i can't really blame you
that was four and a half hours ago now
but the game still allots time for it so it makes some of the animations kinda weird
(also if a spider makes it next to me i just turn to face the wall and accept my death)
night at 5 am
im in bed before my sis
guess whose monitor broke the night she needs it
gummy don't break ida's monitor
on the plus side the number of magicka potions i used in that span probably cleared up at least a hundred pounds of carry weight in my inventory by the end of the game
i’m just lazy and did an all in one kind of character
congratulations gummy you act at least ten years younger than you are
my classes hardly have gotten cancelled this semester and i don’t approve
blitzypoo is next in line
i don't know dating
anyways since my two dating advisors bunni and flubs aren’t on
okay blitz how long do i have to know someone before asking them out?
thats the best
first that gives you time to see if you actually like them
kugal don't encourage my stupid
set her on fire then she'll be hot
or are we talking about ida
just tell her "good, i eat enough meat for both of us"
the females only have bad luck though because you keep trying to talk to them
pfft
kugal he said _smart_
no drago
i keep asking gummy but he keeps changing the subject for some odd reason
yeah i'm surprised there's that many too
interesting
either or
panda's here who wants to talk about butts
i'm not either but it makes my inner seven-year-old giggle
<:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
amen to that one
i can hook drago up with a girl
see ya drago
set who up with me now
yes she is legal to smoke it
night drago
how old is she
she is 19
i mean i did the age test
hey my ex gf who thinks she’s from another world is 22
i wouldn't exactly call it a test.
also did i say i was going to sleep? i lied i got distracted by reddit
what other girl gum
but jesus that reminds me im gonna be 17 in like a couple of months
i think she deserves someone ten times better than me
you and her go out
why are you trying to set me up with people in the server lmao
of course it isnt
because idk any other females
im gonna invent it for the lonely and desperate though
my parents want the opposite
everyone wins
why is he asking me about shit thats past due
does that help
plot twist i never slept
~~sleep is for the weak and squid~~
is the twitter-removing-the-like-button thing real or did i forget to wake up this morning
good job?
that’s not the reason you should have to dislike this happening...
so anyway, i drove a half hour to class, only to find out that class was cancelled
why didnt dragonite see said email?
guess who got an email saying that class was cancelled!
either my teacher's email account is magically broken and it's the only one because i"m still getting every single other piece of spam that the school sends out to every single student, or my teacher didn't send an email
oops didn't see you there
but skyrim sure is alluring isn't it
i recorded stuff earlier. need to edit it sometime
i should probably record something
my desk drawer is jammed shut and that's where i keep my wii remotes
needs more letterboxing
go back to bed
#getidaoutside
shit i needed ida since idk how to food shop
maybe revise that sentence
so sad. i already miss its weird screeching and rubbing sounds
buy food to make into food dont buy instant shit
just buy food
its better for you and prolly cost less
is it even that good for you
well i eat like what the soldiers ate in the 18th/19th century
instant coffee
is what good for you
it just tastes like dirt
wow draco that one hurts
if that happens and it goes big that would actually increase my viewership
honestly
i don't see anything wrong with it
why did i quit...
and i loved it
i have notifications turned off
both on pc and phone
provolone is pretty good but mozzarella is better
because youtube hates me
great news
flubs front and center
becaues that'll take forever
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
yeah idk why
for some reason
one of my programming teachers told me i failed the midterm because i answered all six qurstions instead of choosing five
holy crap
i know that, deci
silly dragonite its not the pastime its the career
guys
nick valentine has the same voice actor as belethor and a bunch of other minor skyrim characters
gummy
dont do that its bad
ok, time for sleep. don’t burn the place down; i want to be awake to see it
okay, so where you do want me to put this lighter fluid at?
flubs no
honestly i think a lot of people would stay in the server if they were greeted by a bot calling them a fuckwad and saying he was gonna murder them
no promises
it breathes a certain air of positivity i think the world could really use
its so very fair and balanced that he gets a free soul charge
anyway, i can chill and sleep finally
you should do a histiry essay on tbe history of history essays
i would totally do that
so basically the whole ordeal
im curious now
his excuse was that he has bipolar disorder
anyway i really should do the whole sleep thing bye
good luck gum
delete it
i have uploaded all of my 2014-2015 super mario 3d land videos
i should probably install a virtual machine with ubuntu or something
drago
drago go to taco bell
i was not informed of this
let’s collab and do a super mario bros 3 speedrun
i should have said chipotle
but they have tacos and burritos
i always want to try chick-fil-a
and walmart in the frozen food aisle
probably
the best thing ever
which makes you eligible for a parking ticket
hmmmm. to study for my midterm tomorrow or to watch gotham
like some people do
ever had baklava, kugal?
it's a dessert pastry made of phyllo bread, filled with a mixture of crushed nuts, and held together with a syrup.
cashews are pfft
i also like cheese
help 8 things from my steam wishlist are on sale
it’s too fun not to
so i'm in no way tempted.
still havent touched that yet
despite someone gifting it to me
blackwake is on sale
how does one get someone in trouble in online school?
were you helping students on tests
i came in to class
where does this guy live? flubs and i will teach him a lesson
real scary
exhibit a: gummy
my friend occasionally looks at me in class and smiles at me...is that a good sign?
do it
mom wants me to abuse, i mean trim the hedges, gummy ill get back to annoying you later
then yes its good
i’m craving a coffee. what’s happened to me
because i made everyone here addicted to coffee
maybe it’s the fact that i have a lot to do in the next 48 hours and all i want to do is nap 🤔
your body wants you to get coffee ice cream instead 😉
i am
not stupid to a point where its affecting my well being
and then there's stuff like the halting problem and the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics
“no drugs as well pls”
i don’t, so i don’t know why i want one
just to give ya an idea
sorry that’s happening, blitz
also take everythign i say with a grain of salt, im just angry, i dont mean anything i say
this isnt real
good choice kugal
im doing it, i cant let today happen again
maximum full melee flow mode
or that you can’t be accessed by them, so they’d know it anyway
the focus is all just from running eidolon hunts
okay im back from flirting with my hot friend
i may regret the lack of energy
who said what to me?
lmao then youd watch it if you really wanted to
and tease gummy
where are my dating advisors?
good luck bella
no flubs and not robot
cool thanks
good luck
im not too fond of halloween
ironically last year my place got 0 trick or treaters
go trick or treating instead
one year we turned off all of the lights and covered the door in bloth to make it look totally dark like no one was home and someone stil came up and spammed the doorbell
only worse thing is apple slices <:kappa:374346980136058893>
people are pretty adamant about getting their candy
lies
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
well that was tragic
f indeed
it's ok, there's always next time
shit i would be older than my big sis
im asking her out thursday
okay thanks but
im kinda curious to see what she'll say lol
what
my friend that is
that is not a pick up line
that is not normal
perfect
we live like the 18th century
enjoy
jeesh its almost 4, where did time go
screw the bus
she did a lot today in a teasing way
sooo if i date her
why would i have it?
does everyone use pick up lines on you or what?
i dont think thats how it works bud
also probably why i don’t like them
why has no one used pick up lines on me?
i went out of a bathroom
boy were they wrong!
cause thats the most common answer
and i don't want to spend money on drops after noticing that recovery time was faster when i didn't use them
dare i ask what his response was?
with spongebob
interesting
my intuition tells me that after a while there's only so much you can measure in the universe, the more advanced you go, the more it transcends the real world so why apply numbers into that context
i can’t get my head around it
sounds fun. might be able to later
i tried playing morrowind once but if you do that on anything newer than windows xp it becomes a walking catastrophe that i can't be arsed to fix
nobody asked you cortana
ehh just use wine
flubs roll and talk to me
but the c did not accept the peace treaty
pls use code word
caught up on last week's flash for the episode tonight
id hope so
they had a strange start schedule but its evened out
everything was great until i went to work
there, i felt more easily irritable than usual
i dont think i played anything on the gamecube
i guess they didnt make any in the years i played nintendo games
sticker star destroyed everything
when is paper skyrim coming out
when elder scrolls 6 is cancelled, dragonite
don't joke about tragedy rc
i would write a very angry letter to todd howard's mother
i was busy
secrecy
places arent open
we're fucked
amazon is 24/7
yeah but i need this stuff tomorrow morning
enough alcohol to get and stay drunk for all of tomorrow, a cheese wheel, a pinata, and hat
nobody has it also how the fuck do you get robbed by a me
howd you get that funky n
whaaa
oh wait
master its cursive
i think the elven dagger has the fastest swing rate
sick
oh wait the ghost weapons have lighter weights than normal weapons so they might have a faster swing rate
permaban him
fuck it
<:doit:334014889137930240>
<:doit:334014889137930240>
i found someone im smarter than
sot has more content, which is saying something
guys
predicted death date: 8 december 2057
time left: 39 years, 1 month and 9 days
gummy i can break that thing gimme it
nice
how does he get to live longer than me?
i practically diet off of pizza rolls, ,that's not at all healthy
a majority of my diet is frozen food and cold cut sandwiches
looks like you guys are outliving me
ahhh
i'm just going to check on all three stimulants
that's 24 hours from now
that doesn't seem right to me
its the only way ill survive
i’m celebrating by doing nothing
i get out a bit earlier from class than usual today. may watch something on theme. looking forward to discounted candy though
no you don't
i’ll probably just eat a couple pieces of candy my parents will hand out
i’m 5’8”
ida aren't you taller than most people
if it makes you feel any better you're probably taller than ida when she was about six years old
i hate you
hey at least im taller than my maybe gf
i'm popeye the sailor man, i'm popeye the sailor man! i'm strong to the finish 'cause i eat me spinach, i'm popeye the sailor man!
you guys dressing up as anything today?
she’s basically a vegetarian
i have an opportunity to record xenoblade today, the question is, can i be bothered to turn my wii u on
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
xenoblade it is
i think i did
i should probably go to class soon
we're apparently going to be talking about github again
i prefer pid personally
shouldve replied "because your mom told me"
thats why
hmmm
lmao
wait you have your normal icon how did you do that?
lmao even wolfy doesn't like "to-mah-to"
he probably swapped back after that screencap was taken.
so thats $60 an hour for private security and $2600 for the flight and hotel
you guys ever get the feeling that the best way to find points for your argument is the flaws of the antithesis?
better than canadian weather
i will pay for her food though
i have to do a paper... but its also halloween.
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
its already christmas season
unless dragonite feels like staying up till 2 as usual
perfect
watch la la land with me
tcp stands for "the candy protocol" right
ftp is for like lettuce and cabbage and stuff though there really should be a separate protocol for the important stuff
uhhh
a little late, but i changed my name because i felt like it
nice nice
do tomorrow's physics tonight?
i do get made fun of too if i slightly grow it out
my physics teacher anyway
<:doit:334014889137930240>
perfect <:lul:305559915714576385>
academic or professional?
the skittles have been decimated too but now my tongue hurts too much and i dont want to eat anything else
academic
i hate halloween
gummy shut
oh they definitely are
i think halloween is moreso a fashion show now
halloween is dumb people dont even look like scary
or take matters into your own hands
im a kaiser
hey man i profit regardless
~~a kaiser roll?~~ <:keepo:327304799919800321>
okay can't wait for tomorrow
hia gummy
was that a gta reference rc?
aww...
awww whyd i do that
remember to not overthink it gummy, just ask "do you want to go out with me"
that's not what i was going for
gummy, are you trying to get no one to date you?
at the store, from your sink, in a river
what even is that
okay idk how woman think and bunni isn't around to tell me
i was watching some of the halloween episodes
you record your office?
he only gets more creed-like. its great
like so many times i wish micheal would bully her hard
ryan is one of my favs
but i love ryan
i do enjoy some of gabe's scenes when he's not going crazy for erin
he left his kid at the end so what? he's cool
the office
the office
i was confused
jim's probably still my favorite out of all the major characters
depending on context, especially the dwight one
gummy, you're definitely more dwight than jim
because spoopy memes
im here doing hw in the dark
the power he had in season 4
and its not fun
pffft haha
im gonna do that next time
if gummy wants to ask her out he must impress her
i feel deja vu coming along
not on netflix
of course he went corrupted
jeez that box office is a lot
where do i take a girl who only eats veggies and chicken out?
so she only eats birds, maybe deer
since beef
just order a medium rare steak at a nice place and the vegan instincts will be put to the test
i.e. how much your purity score drops
depends on how good the date is
my purity score is like a 90
just do that to yourself mentally
works for me a little too well
that doesn't mean you can do my drugs
there is a 25% chance she will say no
also that ^
the odds are low
watch her on the bus if she says yes
why do i have to be the "man"
<:rooblank:399827527289536512>
my friend sent me this emoji 😑
he is lonely
with what sleeping? <:gwcentralpikalul:377110562116468766>
weird, i can do that soon
but you're still a tad young for that lol
well yeah
panda, let's go get coffee
the name is quite fitting in this situation
and i usually take my coffee skim and 0-3 sugars depending on the day
gummy yeas
i think usually do almond milk
i can relate, my daily coffee costs me 3 dollars
i'd say mine costs me
hope you aren't actually drinking it everyday
i start every morning with a triple mixed with milk and chocolate protein powder
straight as the sword she forges?
well, mostly fittings and horseshoes
though she does have a scimitar which is less straight than her
or like straight as an arrow
<:lul:305559915714576385>
that spelling doesn’t agree with me
man she is teasing me hardcore saying all music i am talking about is sooo 2012
minié rifle
post malone? <:roothink:399827523581771796>
let me repeat that
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
gummy likes to segregate in his mind
and yes ida i have weird friends for example
i need help with my hair
and that i should stick to history
i am a hair person
but now i'm gonna make sure she thinks you're hideous
i got acne on my forehead as well
besides you can't hurt me rainy
.....
she will fight you
my own sister against gum
<:roothink:399827523581771796>
you were an idiot
blake isn't fuckin jacked
i am gonna kill her tomorrow!
me neither (sorta)
those are the best girls
and she said it's famous and i am an unculture swine
raven, sorta kinda
yes, but you see the problem is you never know when to stop
because eventually you cross a line and you go back to us and ask what you did wrong.
i will stop when i get there
when it was quite obvious.
see ida gets it
my grave!
partly
is this true?
i think i’ve only seen an episode of scrubs
it doesn't make it clear that that's her own grave
alright, everyone come over to my place, and we shall watch it and have the time of our lives
well ida knows me well how i always somehow i accidentally do it
night sis *hugs tighly*
sleep over?
i prefer a slumber party
fuck twitter just brokoro my kokoro
on purpose
i told her she is the best
i just said she has more than you.
bam roasted
it’s like what me and drago so
it’s fake
what's this sleep you speak of?
so what's the other option bella?
i wouldn’t know what to order. i should try that out
of what the literal differences were
if you like white chocolate go with that
oh look it's three in the morning how'd that happen bye
good enough for me, thanks guys
what do i sound like? some attractive guy that all girls fall in love with?
smash just gets way too much hype and attention
real men play mario kart
mario kart 9 is happening?
probably when the tenth gen consoles come out
next week boys next week....
okay well i blame flubs
in the northern hemisphere
well gives me a few days to work out what i wanna say to her
next holiday is christmas
because i left cookies and milk for santa once
enjoy
apparently not.
flubs.
i need your advice squid
why would it be thanksgiving related
wonderful, thank you
a character from xenoblade if i'm not mistaken
him too
that certain emperor is me
i was actually surprised they're going all out on dlc
how do you know that
oh flubs she got sick tomorrow
panda
no problem
and i can’t say i want more from the game because tons of people will call me selfish or ungrateful and say i should be happy with what we already got. fucking stupid
it was; it’s the main reason why i find smash overrated. that and i’m not a fan of fighting games
alright
but yeah, rex got relegated to being a fucking costume
hmm?
but it still has my boys
ah, purpleeyes
lab was so empty today
yeah, i guess that’s a point
i'm just really grateful that sakurai has and will continue to work on this game for some time
that was because i didnt have enough material though
but thats just because nerves
there you go
flubs
what did you say to you know who when you asked her out?
i mean theres no reason a girl shouldnt ask out a guy
who is you know who
in fact i appreciate it
i agree with flubs
worth it if it works
just have no self esteem
its only two late when one or both people are dead
alright but fear of rejection flubs
okay, yeah, true
but fell in college love
i was nice then all a sudden i was mens
here gummy ill quiz you and see if youre an incel. how would you refer to a girl who dumped you to your friends?
i got a lot of things happen to me during my love life
so i would say they were sweet?
since they were still my friend
i wouldn’t care unless they were still dating someone
i slept through it
gummy you're supposed to learn that in junior high
they started that in 5th grade for us
what else?
elementary was 0-6 here for reference
my drug friend almost got pregnant
ok but you understand that her being in a previous relationship changes nothing right
go on
depends who i don’t like
not an a hole
you know
which is a lot of people
there arent really more though
i just got home what's gummy doing now
in my life time
and upset
well good luck with that whole thing. personally ive given up on relationships because i suck at them
although skyrim would technically be useful in that it would prevent me from eating any more candy and that's probably a good thing
who knows maybe she has a dark side like me
you mean my little one or ida?
so i don't know what i would do if i wanted to settle down
yet you were in the hospital waiting for her
wait
gummy im a fuckin moron
no no no that is a good quality to have
even though well...
ahaha no
and i cannot stay stable
you take my little sister
the book says go somewhere fun
i need someone to help me grocery shop
i'll buy wine
nobody goes to the arcade anymore
1 cent
okay...
if youre asking them out invite them over
why is the library a choice?
history all the way
anytime xd
god i hate november
no offence ida i know you would
just think in less than a year you'll be able to go to a bar
that is benny's date
wtf a farmer market...that is worse than a library
not mine
so i would have to pick
itd suck almost as much as not being able to find you gba when you wanna play on it
where we wanna go
farmers market it is
fair rule is whoever asked imo
okay does the girl pay for dinner or is it the guy?
probably helps not to limit it to one place
oxygen
or what bella said
there is this good ice cream place...
ice cream is an all weather dessert
i lost my gba and my ds with the slot in the bottom
we got a bus advantage
true
tuesday no matter what
is there a stream right now?
you could help me map out the city
thats not a castlevania game
told her over snapchat because she pressure me to say it because i told her i had something to tell her
yes you can
i got rejected
gummy i'm so proud of you :')
yay?
but can i ask when will king of zeal/superskarmory will be back recording for youtube again?
i doubt even _he_ knows honestly
i am a disappointment to myself
i was watching his ocarina of time vids as it felt so nostalgic
still brokem
yes thanks
my ex is now crawling back to me
that’s how broken i am
i told her if she can build public relationships with me again
past tense
like why do you care, lol
that kid who i blocked, his brother confronted me about it in the middle of class
fighting him is better
did you guys even listen to him?....
also i wanted decidueye instead of incineorar, but i'm good already with the roster
>that sad moment when you realize you have a stronger connection with piranha plant with the games you've played over the characters in the fake banner/grinch leak since you haven't played those characters games
my teacher say the conversation and sent probably one of the sweetest emails i've ever received
skyrim
<:lul:305559915714576385>
yeah it was xp
i really want to get thi gs done
who knows, i don't feel like a mii costume would be enough to completely deconfirm a character possibility
well i wish i saw that edit sooner
like i said to that certain person i saw, he could always be dlc
smash 4's dlc had 4 newcomers
<:lul:305559915714576385>
"we got to have.... *moneyyyyyy*"
it's 3 characters
i'm not sure on how many stages we got with smash 4's dlc btw
the german empire anthem is amazing
and they were called duck hunt duo in europe
of course you'd listen to that
bummer we didn't get smash run though, but oh well
i loved playing as them
hopefully there's not going to be another stupid great maze again
the "not-so-great" maze.
and then it turns into who cares about a boyfriend when you can get an a in calculus
yes its more chill than secunda, dragonite
how many square tomatoes is it if each tomato is 3
which is better than platforming imo
i am a kaiser
i have my character predictions ready for the dlc
i see you are making use of that right today
yeah i expected as much
still gunning for elma and joker, though i have my doubts.
i know have gms open and am staring at it like "is this code i do not know what code is"
something makes me doubt that being a good thing
it probably wasn't important right
this isn't in any order btw
nah, just felt like saying it
for the record i didn't invent you rang i got it from foxtrot who got it from the addams family
who probably got it from somewhere else
you said yeet like 6 years before it became common
i could have invaded canada with all of my stupid high school videos
how did i miss that
oh you know what it's private
gummy just tell him it's dragonite's fault he'll probably believe you
i guess if you have steam 2fa enabled you should grab your phone too but only if you own skyrim
mcns were nice in like 2009 when they were the only way to get partnered but 2009 was kinda a while ago now
gren'ich gren'ich gren'ich ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
im bored want me to dig out more of my high school nonsense?
and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade and told of bold lies and the gold he had made
hey gummy remember when you bought hg and the guy sent you a pirated version anyway
so greenland is on white witch time
also i played x in italian once even though i can only read like ten words of italian and was fine so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
cant get demonetized if you dont make any money in the first place
other n64 games aged decently, sm64 was not one of them
i actually dont really like the smb3 overworld
gummy how do you say "over your dead body" in russian
the 90s were a mistake
good maybe i should not give a shit more often
anyways, i have nothing to do until stephen’s extra life stream starts in around 3 hours
destiny 2 is supposedly free until nov 18 but i cant find where tf the free version is downloadable
hey master youre a hardware guy right?
and i tend to call myself a cat so that makes me a furry
alright they got the password
oh there once was a hero named magus the red who came riding to whiterun from old rorikstead
e!wolfram translate morse code ....------·-·-·---...

majora's mask is like the hardest game ever
and it actually takes months unless you pay money
so many options
it's painful
see if the achievements were no hit a boss or complete the game at sl1 thatd be fun
im at 0%
you know what better than that
it was trash in gen 3
anyway, so drago's going to hear the new battle theme then
why is there always a spider in my bath tub?
always been trying to catch that one in animal crossing
poor paris
i hate eating recently
dread it
like i just dont enjoy the action of eating
run from it
im also wondering this
peggy still arives
are they nice?
peggy is a fucking nightmare
runs at the speed of fucking sound into a brick wall and smashes her head into the ground
why peggy why??
as much as i would love to see everything go down, i have work tomorrow afternoon
good night ^^
she can outrun the smashening
aint nobody cooler than this dan
be a shut in neet who hasnt seen the sun in two years
yeet

we are many
amazing island is *already* back in fifth
sucks for you when daylight comes back in the soring
sup pham, i just got a switch, so if u got one and wanna add me, here’s my friend code.
what?
thats a lotta dollars
today i had to get up by 6:30
amazing spiderman2
i wake up at 6 for work. makes me feel like i have a productive day
when i had to get on the bus at 6:50 and be on it for an hour
how can you not get used to it
well getting up at 5 means i get to work at 6, which means i stop work at 2 and get home at 3. so i have my whole day open
12 is what i find early
i woke up at 9 today and really wasn’t into it
you get used to it.
sleeping doesnt make me less tired
1 am
okay now i am one hour behind flubs
maybe ida
interesting
hey bunni msg me perfect
i spent 1 hours before i fell asleep watching musket videos
im gonna do it beb
master = not skyrim and not sleep = not.good
good idea
i do indeed
he lives!
i dunno wat to use
use the one that doesnt sear your eyes
because christmas
there are several sections of the year:
christmas 
magfest week
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823> lonely months
hot and lonely months
because it's christmas soon™
lets all go to magfest
i still dont know *what* magfest is
it's also a secret excuse to eat hamburgers all weekend because all of the other food in the area is either expensive or trash but dont tell my mom i said that
only convention i know what i want to go to
when going to nyc we do usually stop at albany overnight to visit friends tho
you should probably do that too
if you pay me
he has hair like you
perfect drago
radioactive is close enough
its directly across the sound from me and they have cheap crab and cheap alcohol
drink alone in sadness and cryu
ct is basically a highway with a toilet stop right
actually i think there was a dude selling ice cream by the toilet stop too
i give you my presence
playing around with my joke youtube channel
guys what do you do when that one guy you never wanted to hear from again in high school keeps messaging you and/or calling your phone
time to join fullscreen
freedom it is
it's like 1974
wing together a perfectly calculated setup
i think you're a bit too concerned about the layout but if it makes you happy and gives ya something to do, go for it
the overlay for oras looks nice
wait stream is on now?
guess i'm going to hell (the piece is called the gates of hell btw) lol xd
out with family
demand your money back
i don't see a sign that says "abandon all hope, ye who enter here"
lol xd
what else would be on the do something useful category?
hmm eyan's streaming
i figure once i 100% it i'll get sick of it and not play it again for another two weeks right
i think it took like 180 hours the last time i did it
or just not do them
twitch is broken for me
but i like free experience and money
that sounds even worse
x also has two achievements which are 'slay 100 of each ultrafauna' and they're both superbosses
drive into pillars, is a good insult
who needs to fall of the level when you can just drive into pillars, on 200cc no less
go drive into a pillar
these are quite obviously shrute bucks
gummy you deal with rc i have code to write
that's what work wants you to think
it’s so dark out
you're allowed to run around it if you can't kill it somehow
one on the broken ds one on the not broken ds
that's how many up arrows there are in the mathematical up arrow notation for the number of how many ideas he's had
i need a script writer
stephen is great tho
"let me make my *entire fucking life* public
all vloggers are uninteresting.
wait a minute
see, peggy.
he’s just professional
understandable
dont google that
im still kinda shock ida edits better than me
also writing is hard \
well i need a script writer
that explains a lot tbh
but what if youre a poketuber
that concerns me slightly less than mr. joe on street street knowing everything about my daily life
i like the stream, it's chill
flubs, you need to react to more than just the c
c is the only letter that's actually a base though
shes laying on my leggs
was a very interesting car ride.
can i rage a bit?
my mom's boyfriend put on a ben shapiro debate today
how many years will that take
i went to get free coffee at the bank while my dad did his deposit, bragged about free coffee, walked out and slipped on the ice and coffee went all over me
they're waffling about somewhere, i'm sure.
ice on the sidewalk
dragonite
it was on their property
but were you actually paying attention
brb class
well i need a lawyer and my sis is the only one that knows how to do this law thing from those ace games she played
i dont have his phone number
i wonder if they can sue you for wasting their time
how dare she say that
she likes making fun of me
it made a really loud nosie
you tripped over a mouse?
on today's episode of weird news
it's okay i called the vet
i have it
thanks
do you want a wall of 3's, flubs?
if you want absolute precision 100/3 is just 100/3
well i'm not going to give it to you
well yes. but sometimes we don't like fractions and prefer decimals
hex superior
but with the question of dec100/dec3
the chicken looks like i ran it over with a cement mixer
flubs thats normal right
rain rain go away come again another day

specifically right over gummys house
it's a dital image compressed using a discrete cosine transform
tomorrow i meet up with the girl who rejected me
i kinda wanna hear the story behind that
tried sending a picture with a message, but it didn’t go through
well done!
itd be an upgrade
also its not loadi g for me
there
~~you~~
hmmm
wouldn't they also show your face on the news?
i regret going down this road
hahaha
<:lul:305559915714576385>
fawkes? tom fawkes? <:keepo:327304799919800321>
what does that page say?
the wikipedia page for "lewd" redirects to the wikipedia page for "rainy day gamer"
"don't fucking try me"
and i believe i still have the exact same score as a year ago. this is what happens when you never get a relationship
maybe i should find jesus
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
oh wow
i'm smelling some serious heresy
i had a 70 something on this last time i check
also i used a random follower for the boethiah quest and now i feel terrible
but the islands disappearing bit
not the "no one noticing for 30+ years" but
they're your friends
the disadvantage of a morning class: i really want to get the thing we need to do today done already
history?
second on the list is annoy drago
hmmm
the reasons anyone would want to play it are beyond me though
like sit there and do nothing
also the more i talk to my uni friend
im lonely
flubs find a female version of you pls
oh i know that one guy from pirates of the caribbean
well flubs
i feel sad for him
that guy
comadore
i don't do that unless asked
thats on them
come on ida i give you attention all the time and you don't seem to like it
thank you person who said that
lmao
regal said it
according to vikings they don't say that
a hug is the most anyone gets from me
so it's even
i only hug people i like
congrats
you'll learn to enjoy it
i been too busy with gummyland
oh well for if it's nothing to do with a monarch then eh
just did my good ol civic duty
sounds funny
i sold my civic duty for drugs
only if you take them according to prescription
the drugs in question being antidepressants and vitamin d
oof i wanna lean to bros 3
i have beaten smb1
someone should collab with me
gummy what would you even do if you managed to do that
not do oot: master quest blind, probably
i know
okay, because 100%ing mm is not as bad people say it is, and you're also on the remake and not the original
because video game movies are famous for being well-made and successful
is that that rap robot tts game
im with a bunch of nerds playing a card game
though i still wish trivia murder party comes back
and then give it all to me because it was my idea
okay, this is an interesting prompt for patently stupid
i dont see it
i'm supposed to be doing homework
same to an extent
do you play nerdy board games?
how on earth are they like me then
wait how can the big man move
anyone here?
dude im great at chess
ahh bob ross
i gotta wait 20 minutes for the bus
gummy read fedpaper 10
it's mind numbing
or flubs can come and keep me company
regal is kinda like you
im so cold right now
or bludgeon gummy with your cane
don’t have a lighter
bus is here
fiddlesticks
....
a little late, but x&y were really bland
well
first thing in mind that i think when math is said is calculus
is that my cue to spend the next four hours writing code for things other than classwork or
antiderivatives are pretty neat
so did i it's called "asking kugal to do it"
is there any actual use for a function whose order is 29
but that method is gold
i forget what the other name for the biggest exponent is
python is heavy on indentation for formatting, java is heavy on brackets
what’s wrong with breakfast
okay the last time i ate breakfast voyager 2 had officially left the solar system, but only just barely
our calc teacher just sent this
the "getting up before 10:30" part
maybe 4th
things it doesnt do right: 68,7634,541
things it does right: 1
lets look at java(script) for comparison
or any standard input for that matter
i mean javascript wasnt really designed for taking console input
although node probably lets you do it
yeet
we all die eventually gummy
i wonder if i can launch both the special edition and the regular edition
2 monitors+
my teacher is swearing at git
i.e. dragonite
earth prolly
im a kaiser
got ho-oh \o/
it is bad
also i taught my dad how to use discord
flubs we should hang out sometime
new dan
<:lul:305559915714576385>
is that broccoli
string cheese
yes and i showed you her insta before
he seems like a fairly attractive man from the right angle
get it out of my head!!
and had to close my eyes for the rest of the movie
im still grossed out by that movie
welcome!
hi person
same for me!
dude snow is awesome it just doesnt get off the fucking sidewalks and i cant get to work
after that it's less fun
i have a heart with someone on snapchat
ironic that it's with breana
basically 2019 is a long year
as long as a year is, anyways
my ex, friend, and i are gonna make a channel for mlp stuff
im actually not fully in charge of editing thank god
why is your name ponk
it's the sound that my fist makes when it collides with the top of his head
and somehow he likes me
most shit post admin would be...yeah prob master
ida don't encourage him
that violence was meant to be for irony tbh
you don't remember when we first met
i don't..
i do
you weren't as annoying
changed*
no you're not
to be honest
yep!
but most of the time you see me act crazy around here
sorry ida but i can't take orders well or do something i don't wanna do
i would have destroyed everything
she means me
this server is not nearly as mentally taxing as some others i'm on
someone lemme know if thats too harsh, i'm legit not sure
i like war but usually when i am here i think about it more
which leads me to think about war the most when i am here...
great now i just know my mind is as bad as eyans thanks
no drago
right gummy?
gummy you weren't enemies both of you were just dumb
and i thought ida was actually gonna end up like one of them because when eyan's server started she just went super mean to me
not here, apparently
we are good friends now
still is
i feel like i missed a lot in the few months i was gone
after 3 months they are either a sibling, best friend (flubs is the only example), or an enemy
and one of them threatens to punch me
do you make enemies so easily?
im too rough now
you were here yesterday though
which i defended
ida i need protection
but i feel a lot tougher now
i know
can confirm because school is stupid
but if you talk to the right people you don't even need that
the war of 1812 is a war that was started in 1812
who has heard of the war of 1812?
what
cheers
werent there two of them
i am suing my school
even the rejection ones
let em come to you
we are gonna do that
but we can still be friend
that will piss off two people i know for sure
just remember you got your whole life ahead of you
thank god since i hate kisd
it reduces the chances for stds and makes it less enjoyable for you
can't have friends knowing
unrelated but how much do prime time ads on national tv cost?
the russian anthem told me to follow my dreams
holy shit i am thinking what ida said to me and it’s hitting me hard
we've talked about this before
i miss my ex and best friend now
for once i thought about it
theres some things i want to catch in the pokéwalker but it requires me to get a lot of exercise and i dont feel like walking the dog or going a bunch of circles in the kitchen
has nintendo given up on qa or something
so nekopara is on switch now
nest
i'm leafleaf
<a:atpc_jumpcited:485160985028460546>
i don't remember but it might be
you need to think less
change your nickname then
flubs says "gee gummy what is your plan?"
thank you.
i say 3 more let's plays!
this let's play stuff i will only work on
what about civ?
hey ida when are we gonna hang out again?
civ, league errrr
i have castle crashers
not the first game
i gotta get through that
you can play multi player in portal?
hey heard about that new undertale prequel game?
the first chapter of it is free gummy
hey, wanna watch lion king 2?
okay
and flubs
sorry
didn't know who it was so i rejected the request
but back then it was absolute horseshit and no one wanted to pay $60 + a monthly subscription for a shittier version of wow
jeez how many ffs are there now
back when it first launched
wowee
but the hard drive investment is not to be taken lightly
too many
the world thing on steam
and probalby even more that ive never heard of
two handed or some sorta conjurer is what im leaning toward rn
usually just end up getting 50 in one handed and giving up and go full warrior
wasn't really my thing
ended up fisting alduin to death since i was a khajiit
because i'm terrified
hmmmmm
still the same thing in oblivion
but you could conjure armor along with that
btw i think this war thing has gotten to my head
actually you know what
why were there germans in hong kong
i have 108 as my iq
then ambushed and i remember crying when machine gun fire ran down
i’m very curious to know why some guy has a cut out of what i think is ash’s hat strapped onto his forehead
gonna take a bet and say soulcal
i dont like playing as an archer
lab mates and i today picked up beans with different items in the name of science.
i just beat him like 4 times in a row, and he wasnt able to play online before today, and i fucking destroyed him, and the combo i use stunlocks people if they leave an opening and also i kept taunting them
and it was worse than that
also did anyone hear about defy media shutting down?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
406 open squads in orb vallis
tortillas have been eaten sleep now
don't
i haven't had cereal in years though
i guess i could just pet my dog until i have to go
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
hi person
i see
95% chance
guys.
you rang
~~screw family~~
so, what you’re saying is, a hurricane will come tomorrow night just so you can’t stream?
i'm not responsible for hurricanes, power outages, comcast, and acts of god
should i play skyrim
the two protagonists havent interacted too much up to that point
i have downloaded a dating app
that is fair
so i wanted to make a profile with this pic, but apparently my military friend told me it
this is too hard
active?
like me at the park or somewhere
like what i enjoy and stuff
i had a really good analogy for if you meant active like exercise
i can see how outdoor pictures would be more appealing to people
would have love to see how that would turn out
but i have a rarity beach pic when i pretend to be rarity
mapquest is not a dating app
shes been dead for like a billion years so yeah the new old people who live there would probably be confused
you set it on fire
two in the morning is nothing
thanks i've been up for 3 days
you know this sibling role play thing is so fun
wanna hang in vc and help me with my dating profile flubs?
story
and own a casino
flubs i'm looking for work as a professional dog petter, are you hiring?
i could pet your dog for you while you're away doing redacted
sorry fam im employed fulltime doing redacted right now
“i’m not tomboyish, i’m just boyish” - flubs 2018
hi dead i’m squid
there is a moth flying around my room and i hate it
impossible. because that isnt measurable and things that cant be measured dont exist
joe mama
high
flubs i get half your stuff
it's 10:38 and i havent gotten anything done yet tonight
it's what i'm about to listen to
hi i'm fucking done, i'm--oh screw this
hi didnt fucking say im, i'm dragonite
it got too quiet after flubs stormed out
uh huh...
but even if he did you'd probably still do it
he did
im about to do the craziest thing ever
hey it's not
doesn't matter
we only broke up 6 times
gummy here's a handy flowchart for how i think you should make decisions
<:rooderp:399827526744014848>
brought to you by ms paint (tm)
imma do it
lets do a pro and cons chart
wait depends
i did it
did it involve beans
panda might know
a friend for life 
that's what you are to me
okay starting to regret why i did this
10 minutes?
this is one of the rare times i use the mlp way
my way is better
not really gummy just ends up learning the wrong lesson usually
my biggest issue is the amount of services they expect you to subscribe to in order to be able to have a wide selection of newly airing shows
i hate how crunchyroll holds episodes for 1 week before the non paying people can get it
thats not much of a concern to me
guys
greetings and salutations, dan! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!
my fave flavour is salt and pepper wings
flubs i did something stupid after you left
drugs?
i mean uh welcome
what the events that happen? how are they hazing? its an artillery strike
someone doesnt understand how fast explosions are
then suffer the wait and find out later
also is there a stream tonight or something? i've been mia recently
my ex was my bff even though she and me fought all the time
the place
also i had a dream that i was sneak attacking draugr in skyrim
that was a fun dream
thanks flubs
also believe in your king
squidf
nice
next stream probably tomorrow
dragon tales
there we go
welcome
just be like me and make all your videos terrible <:kappa:374346980136058893>
how do i do the tm thing?
hush
yes?
that was kinda funny
but i had a sibling bonding week
i am suspicious
and you didn’t invite me for a drink?
it is right now
its the cheapest option so its what i use
still one of the best anivia players out there
by sometimes you mean always
but it's _almost as if the author has never installed an mmo before!_
obviously he started streaming twenty minutes ago but didn't realize that his internet isn't plugged in
but you didn't let him get ahead
it wasn't my best game
this damn physics project wants me to go to a height of 10 meters to drop something
except you need to actually do something in mario kart to win
you don't have to pay me i just want to pet dogs
on another note, i see a rat lying on my floor and i'm not sure what i should do about it
or do you?
omg looking at the old msgs i was way more energetic back then
you can play the game with no button inputs, that's just how you go in 12th
you need to actually do something to _lose_
holy shit i was not like what i was last year
not that tm
who even knows
someone tell daylights savings to stop so i don’t want to sleep at 5 k thanks
dark at 5? weak
like before daylight savings id feel like i was gonna get axe murdered on my way to work but now i dont
hey ida hows the arctic circle the week before christmas?
i wanted to do something similar in wearing a costume the day after halloween
will do
also i thought you said "treats" the first three times i read that
dark
you can't threaten me
hey everyone is with gummy
correct dragonite
what did i do
tell her that dragonite is cheering for her
oh well ida saved them by hanging out with me
"my father left our family for another woman"
unsurprising
does youtube hate me?
because of what i suffer two years ago
fucking parents
i feel like he's just sleep deprived again
so i am angry to this day over it
flubs wireless or wired?
i have ice cream
or i will, soon
that is all
go to razer
their keyboards have shitty keys
agreed
it was online
oh also i failed the mission
go ahead flubs

you know what's a really good keyboard?
quiet keyboards are nice
also you know what's annoying
my ex is like me
stan lee is dead.....
didnt he die like a year ago
i like him already
his daughter confirmed he is dead
didnt his family try to fuck with him to get a bunch of money or something though
i really want to play rdr2
im sure he would appreciate that sentiment
otto was cooler than lincoln
thatd be like if people stopped fighting during a war for a day and then started fighting again
depends on how much time passes then
today i learn you can make ice
what a coincidence
see my champ pool is l o r g e
every tank
oh god, we’re probably going to get 3-5 inches of snow tomorrow
im listening to music on it just fine
and it does work fine for a lot of people and it doesnt work at all for a lot of other people
history lecture pls
i can make a math/history vid
dont rush yourself kugal
thats what i meant
gummy why are you in my oven
thats sucky rc
they dont even have to rhyme
as long as most of them are in the same language your teacher will just read too much into it and give you an a
bam assignment done
let's see for this recipe i will need:
1. 4 eggs
2. enough flour
3. gummy's liver
i'll get back to you in a few days
i'll watch once i get caught up with galaxy 2
listen, after i more or less dropped off on harvest december after how absurdly long the august arc was, i think i'm at least going to try to get caught up with something that is not 'dragonite tries to read on camera'
i just grew to the point where i stopped caring about the visual novel in general
august was too fucking long anyway and i did not have the time and the interest from prior
no my computer mouse is falling apart
prob was too rough on it
that sounds like peripheral abuse
what, did samsung make that mouse? /s
oh my mouse is an hp
fancy that
yes samsung made it
i think it may have been head icons, specifically the homestuck one
is stream potato or is it on me
will the livestream be live until 11’ish?
im not drunk im flubs
daang 😂😂😂
see the problem is youre using it for the taste and not the not thinking
what’s eyan streaming? xcom again?
i’ll take the silence as a yes
okay, ,the show more input i guess broke
that brings you to a grand total of 55,682 years in jail or cleaning the toilets in the zeal palace until the end of eternity
good to know it's still functional i gu—never mind
gummy i think skarm is mocking you
no he is not
hmm im down to 78 gb of hard drive
yeah
yeah youre definitely up late
i managed to bs my way through most of it in 90 mins
that sounds like vampirism but worse
vampirism is great though
computer mouse*
excuse me sir is this your torch
but yet you want me?
are you surprised
weird right
why is it 9 already
we shall call it "dragonite's law"
also i wanna write code
the amount of dog pets that must happen per second is greater than the amount of seconds that happen per second
so someone tell me why my computer mouse is half beaten to death?
never give them back to me ever again
you're just gonna buy new ones aren't you
sooo yeah
my depression bounces from anger to sadness to anger
then when i got back with her anger happen again
wait
i need that medicine
like?
well, my first time being depressed came when i started taking those meds
dont say that to her please
just because you arent stupid enough to do it doesnt mean you wont do it
i won’t ida
im trying my best to assist
and no
and yet im kinda down for the similar reason but for me it’s more of
it wont cure the lonely but its a damn good distraction
always wanted to experience a life of a soldier in the 18th century
that sounds like his problem
top ten smartest human beings who broke the system
it’s cold outside
says the canadian
im german!!!
we get snow
montauk and the hamptons
people are always angry there
i had fun there
not including western fire island because western fire island is the tits
you hate a lot of places
but you seem to enjoy life
haha no
he hates enjoying things
now i don’t
tbh most of the reason i dont stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing is because id be justified to and people wouldnt really be surprised
though flubs happens to not get under my skin at all...
platinum
i like dogs
dogs are fun
cats aren’t that bad as i originally thought
cats are kinda like me
they lay around all day
wait why dont i stew in a pot of self hatred and loathing
like i only dont at this point because i didnt before
that’s embarrassing
here:
im going to the hair salon
get a mohawk
and torque came up, and we reviewed that τ = fr
actually looks great...
thanks i made it myself i promise
probably by chucking prisoners off bridges and making really precise observations of how they fell to their deaths
i know, but that just gives me a few basic ideas
ida wanna cut my hair?
oh no
we've proved that √2 is irrational, we've proved that the number goes on forever, isnt that cool?
you'd think that would be impossible
because needing to state that two angles that have the same everything are equal as a separate though is absurd
and thats what makes it so not absurd
hey flubs did you know there's the quadratic equation...and the cubic equation? for cubic functions, functions like x³ and not x²
thats the cubic equation
well, math isn't simple because life isnt simple
thats why nobody likes science either
i like science and math though! d:
which is why youre frigging weird
idk maybe the higher level shit is cool but i never did any of that
if anythign it sucks really bad for the lazy kids who arent motivated and dont want to learn what they want you to learn
ok mr 100%
no gummy why
if they dont get high state test scores then some bad shit happens to the shcool or whatever
but when youre taught that shit in fucking 2nd grade art
id expect you to know
and even then i dont know my multiplication tables so not really that even
so i think thats one thing schools emphasized for soem reason
i needed it for my math classes here.
and regardless of your actual intelligence
knowing how to do basic multiplication and the primary colors doesn't exactly make you look smart
i don't talk much in class anymore, not because i dont wanna be made fun of, i've just become more quiet. but last year i wasnt as quiet and i get a lot of passive aggressive speech directed towards me lol
i was one of those until i wasnt
but now it's like the complete opposite
9th grade i took algebra, 10th grade i took geometry and algebra 2
algebra on steroids basically and i loved algebra 2
oh someone just told me algebra 2 is just the new name for trig
wacky
algebra 2 had *some* trig for me
im currently in intro to stat and calc 1
if my school gets another grant i could possibly take calc 3 and differential equations over the summer but i dont know if i want to
my calc 1 midterm was stressful enough lol
done with my phone call
not for me though 😦
dinosaurs are fucking awesome
here ill teach you about dinos instead
theyre fuckin awesome
so somehow i am talking in a breath of the wild server
then fuck em
not a courtroom
bully them back
make them feel useless
bully them back
do it!
im just not gonna acknowledge the guy again
i have fried chicken for you
why is it fried
why is it not alive
yes you can
i’m back from work ya ninnies
guys i spent the evening out of my coffin playing ping pong with dad and it somehow wasn't awful
is having a good time with your father a bad thing?
no that's not the problem the problem was that i was out of my coffin
thats redundant
i could win a world record for how stupidly redundant i can be
draco go watch grass grow or something
i was just about to go sleep actually.
go back to your coffin, dammit
did someone say steak
all sorts of cookies
excuse you all cookies are created equal
butter on cookies?
no theyre like so vanilla that they dont even contain vanilla
also i have 2+ hours of the last two worlds of smb1 to edit
why do i have to suck at this game so badly
i used to like christmas music
i like it
why do elevator button pushers exist
this is torture
ahh yes i see someone has discovered the pitch shift button
thats a tough one drago
speaking of the upside-down
no its bob ross
yes they have animals with names like kangaroo and wallaby and blue-ringed octopus
the answer is yes
google was actually really disappointing
fuck
kugal stop being good at things how dare you
ew facebook
fixed the brother blitz
its comparing two stories and how rhetorical devices were used to advanced and add power to the persuasiveness to each piece of writing
i wrote a poem about hating poetry once
im pretty sure i dont have it anymore and if i did i would probably set it on fire because it was that bad
im getting flash backs to poems some girls in my highschool wrote
like they'd have me read soem of their long ass poems on the spot and i'd have to pretend like its the best thing ever written or else i'd hurt their feelings
poetry for fun is really pleasant
i remember one day in like 9th grade? i sat on the couch and just got caught up on my english work. i got caught up, but not before doing 5+ hours of poetry quizzes and tests and readings and ***uggggggh***
this "3d rendering system" thing is haaaaaaaaaard
"shut up my sentret needs the exercise"
pokemon go is great
probably
so now im your oven
not anymore
i also considered microwave oven and motorized can opener
my butt is going to bed or something
right skarm?
85 watts
and then it ends and you are even sadder because it’s over
human with a side of aged honey mustard
that sounds familiar tbh
i fixed my mouse btw
i guess that works
i broke it with a hammer and fixed it with a hammer
we live in a society
or lack thereof
that would make it heavier than me
is 70 kg a lot and is 20 m/s a lot
watts aren't a lot
155 pounds is a lot tho
the problem is that 70 kg is ehh
maybe i should just take it up to the roof of the english building and drop it
imma become an artist
not with that attitude
bugger off mee
> is already signed into google drive
me good
found this while organising shit
it's my weekend, i ate half a pizza for breakfast, i hate my life
nahhh
i mean, it's not like me challenging gummy is much of a fight
here
i held!
t=+15 minutes and teacher is swearing at git, as usual
oh, eyan’s streaming
but i held on
hey ida civ 6 next?
if i have it i guess
both
i really should probably go home but the other people are being so weird it's hard to resist wasting time to see what airhead things they do next
climate change sure is good aint it
canada has like two seasons
and not july
at this rate i'm conviced fall just completely disappeared. so now there are only two seasons
i don’t want sala
operation operation
i thought it was operation noitarepo
what is a noitarepo
gummy go be dead
it's a girafarig
can’t i just create a goddamn palindrome
but then you would need shirts with three sleeves
but you would definitely pet it 50% more
well
well flubs they usually flow downhill
im gonna do it
i can't tell if you're just being a contrarian
this will be the stupidest thing i ever do
if you know something is a dumb idea
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
everyone gives me a less than 1% chance
great challenge
if you want to do that you can at least waste your life in the casino and not bother us abo—oh wati
i know, but i also know what the key issues of why we broke up
hint you cant
well my sis is not with me
what do you mean you werent informed of this, day 2 of cybersecurity camp when we got raspi's half of the people in the camp were playing minecraft on their damn pi's
why was it forced on?
also it was the professor's native language
rit is not a state university
so the scholarship was from rit themselves?
"opportunity"
compsci 1.5
second semester was more of the same plus a political science elective
and he had this really quiet voice and it was scheduled right after dinner
reasonable amounts of sleep is for the weak
i gotta sleep just to see my my ex says tomorrow
nah cuz if i did that i couldnt get on to the night terrors as quickly
first off, mood
dont enter rem
and i just made up some 9 year olds new gamertag
xxxdragonitespamofmortalperilxxx
flubs thats asymmetric i ahte it
pretty sure that's tje gamertag of a kid on my bus
i like using 489 in names because its very witty and im quite smart
this is epic
this one
dude being sad about the future is next level
i'm in a permanent cycle of mad and sad
i'm sad about the past a lot
as i say
this is the biggest time i chased after a girl this deep
flubs if i managed to get her back, we are making an anthem
or at least your postal code
said nobody but my mom ever
i'm falling asleep from boredom at the same time
no im lazy
dragonite, you do cool things, stop
is it pronounced eye-er or err? who the fuck knows
yay for english
you americans know something called my country tis thee?
you know what pronunciation makes no sense what so ever
is hampshire not pronounced with the shur part
that’s the only way i’ve ever said it
black cats always win
cats seem so cute
i wonder what food is downstairs
i can love both
i want to pet my dog
but she's sleeping in dad's room and i dont want to wake up dad just to pet my dog
thats a funny way of pronouncing dog
unnecessary
nah jk i love my cats too much
demon lord you should upgrade to a dog
i remember begging my mom until we got one xd
why on earth would you want your code to execute _slower_
but nowadays cats are easier for me to take care of
if you were calling wait in the first place you probably dont care about that much
i want you to talk to brad about why python does or doesn't suck
he's of contrary opinions
fuck i should be sleeping
dab drago
minecraft
on the other, what kinda shitty ass parent would disapprove of a class that helps their kid be healthier and more active
but _that_ is the reason people should care not "oh no popular thing"
i tend not to like the kids who play it
college girl and i talk a bit more lately on snapchat
my ex is my interest
is it
1% chance to get her back
i love when it’s snow season just to see the majority of you guys flip out
it just still feels way too early for this area's snow season. and it's not supposed to be winter yet
bella i'm kidnapping you and forcing you to live in the temperate part of the country so you can suffer with the rest of us.
couldve walked at that point
when you grew up in phoenix
yeah
it doesn't have any sort of government
as is the part of antarctica owned by america
i think thats it station wise
its land though
and its got mountains
so ida is this true? “iceland, eh? so she's snow white, blonde or ginger, and knows how to stay warm. <:lol:304159488632422400>”
if it's about me
anyways i am gonna make an anthem
hard, the land we call our home
this, a song of sons and daughters
the bear thing killed me
thanks i hate it
i just woke up to my power being out which is confusing as hell
he got the wrong target.
again
shall we watch again?
sup pals
hmmm
once you know what verbs and prepositions are english is pretty ehhhhhhh
hey drago
how much do i have to pay you to use that?
you’re fat
i just saw a kfc commercial for chicken and waffles that had colonel sanders dancing with mrs buttersworth to that “i’ve had the time of my life” song. where did we go wrong?
this tells me nothing; just as i expected
it’s the only explanation to how i find smash bros overrated
you should use my node script to generate random usually-pronounceable character strings
im bored
does rarity work?
i never knew you were gay ida
well tbh i don't know either
i just go with w/e
hey ida would you punch me in the face if i started shipping you with rainy
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
i got two gay big sisters yay
nah i wouldn't
rainy's cute, i don't mind
that sounds weird. with and without context, gummy
both regal and ida are gay i think
one hangs out with me through games and one hangs out with me through vc
hey i held my own in civ
poetic
i forgot it
so ask someone else
wait i was dating a trans
i dont wanna scroll whats up
a trans?
and "a trans" is very rude
rainy tell me that was a rhetorical question
its only rude if the person its referring to finds it rude
transgender*?
"trans girl" is much less so
my mistake
she is scaring me
you don't need legs anyways
you already have a stockpile
gee sis you are wonderful help
i want electricity someone gimme it back
the answer is violence, dear rc
violence?
vi stands for violence
gummy you have too many best friends
there's the daily dose of insanity
best friends would be ida, flubs, stormy, and breana
what a beautiful disaster this is
then they listened lmao
skarm, language
today a prof told me to make a medicine wheel
haha what a fuckin loser. being mentally stable sometimes. what a nerd
also i'm lactose intolerant and i used to survive entirely on yogurt
same, rainy
inb4 those two actually end up hooking up
.....
i used to be fine with it but suddenly i get sick from dairy
easy cure: make enzymes stupid
so the reason why i am crazy is because of trauma and me not being able to take orders well
i love queer circles
imma smack ya
gummy how dare you
she can wait her turn
i will individually break each and every one of your knuckles
i will break your back
hard to do that without hands, sweetie
kingdom of introverted ninnies: civil war
this is just kingdom of introverted ninnies: 1 vs. 100
civil war...you are talking to a friendship and war general
been waiting for a year
but im like bi polar
hey my sisters are the best
i am genuinely happy that they see me like a younger brother
that's uh, most of the reason i made it
ditto with ida and master
here is a good joke
you promised me a joke wheres the toast
that was suppose to be an insult
in that case do i have you guys' permission to change his name to "drago's toast"
but have no toaster
you could also burn your money
i get represented by two opposite things
that would be awesome
though would mess up my personality
i like trolling hardcore here
omniustoday at 8:45 pm
got my hands on nova prime. what do you think of this moon themed fashion frame?
that is what he asked
i didnt realize that was nova prime but it looks awesome
talk to him about the birds and the bees
fight
apparently he's also supposed to be 7'03''. i don't think i believe it that much
i also have nostrils but no nose
this is fun
and when the truth finally dawns
clyde
lowering the brightness by like 20% did it
i had a shrimp today and don’t like shrimp, what’s wrong with me
help
i just need a hundred more watts to do something fun with the pokéwalker do i take the dog for a walk through the snow or just do a mile of circles in the kitchen again
she'a dumb and wonderful and spills over the floor
i’ll take your silence as “yes”
ida doing something crazy
i am gonna do that
im not human
you know
tbh even though i told my ex i would never want to live there
i do wanna live there
so we are likely to get back together
well shit
10,800 seconds until fantastic beasts
who wants to count down with me
if you asked an order of seconds earlier i wouldve signed up
my friend who lives several time zones ahead of me says it was underwhelming
sick
its great
it took me like a half hour to get out of bed this morning
it took me 10 seconds
just kinda...roll right out onto the floor
i'd join you but i'm already in bed
good job
where did you leave it for that to happen
it happened before i lost it i went to class in the rain a bunch of times
either that or my roof is leaking
mood
i love pie
that was exactly what i meant when i said that
but it didn't make that much of an impact and far less people probably played it
i think it's that they look at the game with the highest accumulated review score
so maybe ones like kotaku's review of the game might be a factor as to how xeno 2 didn't get it instead of dragonquest.
also like what do they matter at all
who even knows, all i know is that smash is probably not likely to get an award this year because of the december release date
insert obvious joke
i like beef
thanks i think i was happier not thinking about that
must eyan stream when i’m not home?
the nirnroot one probably
i did once
weird
running on the world map that is not like frame rate or anything
i dunno if he wants to play that
i agree with imouto
i once did that
would there be a challenge run for pokémon or/as
even if i wouldnt like them under any other circumstances
in which case its perfectly acceptable
same thing with my dad actually, you would think at first he's the nicest guy on the planet, but when you start to spend time with him, that's when things start to go downhill
idk maybe im just weird but i never felt any reason to be nice to my parents
i'm playing with some people
also it's 4 am
oh okay
i get the whole 5 days to myself, no classes or attendence its pretty nice
hmm..
you’re welcome blitz
was a much needed visit because it definitely distracted me from ym stress and stuff and i was feeling lonely as shit this week
it’s always good to get out for a while
personal favorite kind is the one where it only gets funnier and funnier and you  can’t stop laughing, and you try to stop, making it funnier
me: gets up, sees that it's just after 9 am
hey i'm up early for once
that's only three hours are you okay
a bit at two, 3-6, then got up at 7:30
i can’t math rn. it’s ok lol
guys
never played either. both look ok to me
it's a running gag that i never finish anything and then have it destroyed
yes flubs you can once i am done with it
if im alive then ill do it
perfect
that was the plan
though pls don't upload nsfw
or attack anyone
errrrr
you are the best
btw like my new icon i posted in creative?
yeet
as well
there's your score
math bad
no math just made quantum mechanics make sense to human brains
without the catalyst of math the leaps to get here would never be made, not before the heat death at any rate
wait a minute why is dragonite on the side of the physics engine while im supporting the compiler
flubs say something funny
that is not funny
all right where's my provoking stick
i wanna pick a fight with this blade lord person
blade lord nayru*
you should pick a fight with like a bumble bee or something
that was drat—
[dragonitespam's corporeal body has been removed from the space-time continuum]
tell me more tell me more
i wanna hear little dratini stories
i mean i think we all knew that part
remember when a bunch of forum people got drunk and decided to copy and paste their sexuality in lastvillage?
and literally everyone else asked them to stop and they didn't stop?
pogi was the leader
interesting
i worded it wrong but yeah
what?
i was very close to one though
but stop at the end
though years later we kinda talk and hes not over me trying to hunt him down
the most dangerous game
ida wanna talk about pie or something
i can't forgive that
actually there was more than one person...
i mean getting someone sent to prison ruins their life but if they murdered your parents it prolly justified
you dig yourself out of it
don't rely on flubs for it
flubs maybe just wait a little while before being morbid
okay new plan let me dig around
its just an example of when sending someone to prison is ok
it's not medieval there's an office building and cars and stuff in the corner
yes i do
also its a picture
do you criticized all my pics and art?
thats definitely a digital image
so skyrim stream it is when i have time
gonna teach drago
but resetting every time you accidentally blow lydia off a mountain is annoying
play the very special edition
why do you own all the dlc if you gave up ten seconds into the base game
i played for 45 minutes
i rounded down a bit
so you _did_ beat the tutorial bear
hmmm
***hey dragonite did you hear your baby cousin won an award for marching band and was named ceo of earth, incorporated and has a girlfriend*** and by the way are you still like alive and stuff?
or lego® the lord of the rings™
cousin comparison is definitely the worst
also ida there is no such thing as "finishing skyrim" because it's so damn long that by the time you 100% it you've already forgotten the first 75%
oh hey digging through my pics
but i havent run it in like ten lines and i'm terrified
the guy is rich flubs
be nice to your dog
(◕ ε ◕)
which is 100% acceptable by the way
i can't play drv3
without a controller
ive always wanted to become imprisioned in school
so don't watch that
dishonored
gummy you are already a dishonor why would you need to do it virtually
but dont 100% it because the dunwall city trials are fucking horrible
which are basically semiannual two-week black fridays
fair enough
but....
ram might go down in price in 2019
component
you can
no i definitely cant
i will teach you
how many gb per hard drive do you waste on average?
all of it
well if you're ever looking for more harddrive space i think i saw a 1tb ssd somewhere for like $130~140
ssds have gotten cheaper
my ex caught a shiny psyduck in let's go
that's like their whole shtick
every day is black friday with newegg
squid arent you boneless though
lol wearing socks
socks are the only garment humanity needs
not if theyre on the right places
shinies are important
squid squid dont have bones
did you hear someone got sued by nintendo for running a rom site>
yeah but this is newsworthy because it was the biggest one and it was really good and its gone now
and ive been trying to get out of those for _decades_
ill give you an omega ruby
what..
its a gross answer you really dont want it
ewwww
youtube just shitted itself again
it's fine for me now after a couple minutes
i am angry
hi angry i'm etinogard
what kind of bear is the strongest?
black bear
fuck
micheal is almost about to leave 😭
what show
why would i watch a show about offices i go to one every day
why would i need more of that in my life
charizard
then the name is a lie
"these people literally behave like my coworkers why would i want to watch it on tv"
the first season sucks flubs
the second season is when character development starts
or all laugh-track television besides the addams family anyway
i dont watch shows that the first season sucks for. because every single one of those shows is "oh that season isnt very good either it peaks around season 2 bazillion"
i wouldntve watched that on my own
and you love the fat guy
> math
“fucknugget” is that a new mcdonald’s item? <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i have been inspired this morning
would that be a place that sells like rna bubbles or something
drago's pet shop
okay, his favorite food is the fingers of people who aren't as smart as they think they are
hey hey just because i wanted a tyrannosaurus as a pet at one poitn in my life means it's okay for _everyone_ to do taht
tarantulas can be pets
post a video of that on twitter and youtube when that happens
ida if you don't know what those are you probably dont want to look it up
problem is
do you have like an atom bomb i can borrow
wasps. oh wait, that's deadlier
i was so happy in my omega ruby let's play
also creator studio bullshit is dumb
i can be sane when i want to
can someone kill me
crap i was in need of a filled soul gem
i got fired after
what does that mean
gummy has your waifu been informed of this
i did a switch for the day
with a mod
surprisingly all of you recognize my waifu
i'm going to leave it that way until march
welp
my ex and me are bickering
but i want her to
that should probably tell you something
i know
im not gonna pressure
but doesn’t trust me
i never played it out
~~chicken breasts or real ones?~~ <:kappapride:379352530863521792>
you mean 0.000000001%?
yes sis
actually i expected something worse
oh ida hates me today
you rang
taht was like 80% of the fun
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ping me if you set up a game
that's me and ida, anyone else?
it's most fun with like 4+
maybe when i have time wednesday
i could probably find a better one pretty easilyi though tbh
and master is russia
gummy you can be antarctica
no gummy can be germany
i will be prussia though
1815 for the first european one
apparently it came back
prob because of those
i did bad
didnt you only break up like three days ago
flubs we need an anthem after this
few weeks drago
if this works
hey theres a statue of satan in a public square in kansas or something because of the confederation
i dont know if its kansas but kansas is in one of the two groupings of states that are all the same
drago actually watches history videos
all right i'm deleting the internet again
drago you are greedy
drago you suck at making a taco
worse.
still arbitrary.
anyway i have an hour before i have to leave for class should i spend it making games or eating food
i eat them so quickly does it even matter
why do you think im putting them in your sandwich
i'm signing up for classes and apparently i have to take a film class for game design
it’s stupid
i hate film
what is the film class about?
there’s a lot more info about it than o ever realized
i wasnt allowed to mumble and stare at the ceiling
you haven’t gotten grades back yet?
oh damn i'm late i could've subbed in for drago on data structures
sounds like a fun one
wait you *aren't* trolling
im not
“what killed the dinosaurs? the ice age!”
so i watch smosh do a video about harry potter
false: it’s a 51% chance
dragonite does it make you happy that tes 6 is on the same engine as the past bazillion bethesda games
yeah creation i used google
only skyrim, fo4 and 76 so far run on creation
and even if its technically a different engine is it really *different*
is reddit down?
nvm wasnt on wifi
well i dont like having a beard and facial hair because it's more trouble than it's worth
flubs
i'm surprised so many people want warrior.
to me, it's pretty boring, you just swing at shit
you played mage
but that one wasnt fromt he beginning i thought
you were mostly just testing whether or not the stream would even work tho
it might be different now
hey eyan, is it still possible we might see you play fire emblem?
so, uh, i wouldn't count on it anytime soon
just play better 4head
i tried picking up fire emblem echoes last year but i couldn't really get into it
i believe i played the demo for awakening; didn’t really care for it
echoes is not the game to start with
i should work on that
my recomendation would be awakening since its my favorite and its the one i started with
but blazing blade isnt bad either
i just dedicate a day to steam games
and i know echoes is a remake of one of the originals
since i own it, lol
good choice
i'm honestly not that interested in slay the spire
i kind of wanna play 100% orange juice
ive played the older games and for a first fe, awakening is probably the best choice
plus, im super biased towards it
it's kind of boring single player
what was the problems with the steam version?
i'm bored and kind of want to play some multiplayer....
ya'll are kind of making me want to stream even though i didn't want to tonight, lol
i just woke up from an exhaustion nap, hi eyan
holy shit flubs it's crazy
they all left me
duh, i play plenty of games without streaming, lol
cah sounds fun, they removed blank cards though
i never draw them
no bulls allowed? <:keepo:327304799919800321>
it's back, without blank cards
i'm down to  play
tried getting my ex back caused huge issues
like huge
hell no
just when i think gummy has run out of ways for me to be disappointed in him, he disappoints me again.
hey i am willing to risk losing everyone to get my ex back
situation is my ex doesn't trust me as long as i can win that trust
wheres my money then
trust is not something you can always win back, especially if you screw up bad enough.  knowing your track record, i know what i'd be putting money on
blind luck
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
yup but the plan this time was to fix it
they're close *to her*
true
well do it sooner rather than later, and by that i mean throw in the towel
mostly your own
you're killing some of the patience i have left with this kind of stuff
all i can think of every time you bring this up
keep it to dm's, but if you bring this shit up in chat again i'm gonna be extremely attempted to kick you.
that might take a week
gummy
more
can you guys remove me on nov 23?
thats the 26
password?
how do i add slowmode but just for gummy?
exit
like he literally just said
no rc
first time i entered it, it didn’t go through
drago
got nothing better to do, might as well
damn u guys went in on gummy
