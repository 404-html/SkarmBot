ive been banned from a server from my username
but is that an ssd
maybe i should watch less anime
wolve can i just not breath through my nose within a foot of you or something
even though i didn't know what the hell i did wrong
i prefer using my mobo as a gpu and cpi
you don't want to wait until we fight bosses?
byezers
perfectly fine.
waking up tomorrow is going to be a pain, it's always more difficult in the cold
and does the stump have to be chopped for each of its blocks and not even drop any wood?
that means you swung to attack.
do we need a heart for each upgrade?
i though drago said fashion for a sec
i have no idea what the heck is even going on
right, it's apparently because of latency, because i tried a singleplayer world and had no issues
i already deleted all of the installed mods, along with my character and world out of frustration since **no one** here was using the internet besides me
it was, ida.
i dont really rage at games with good mechanics, so im having a blast
fine fine
so i'm going to blame overhaul for my lag
yeah i love running dishonored, but dishonored 2 made me want to die. its all so random
it changed my keys
i think i left my cactus armor somewhere
just a reminder that 3 diamonds are needed for the storage heart.
i'm not that stupid to do it in a rage
🤔 do you think the lag has something to do with the gore?
<:PCMR:305892755014418435> 
\:thinking\:
gummy i will destroy you if i have to
thanks

uhhhh
hey gummy boop me, for, uh, science \*cracks knuckles\*
or slightly behind because effort
that should be accurate

you can ask permission from someone whose not the owner and its still stealing though
if you buy it for a year you get two months free
oh no i didnt mean the food
my pasta
get that checked out
wowza that's a huge emote
its so dumb looking
yes ida
okay, i suppose "everything that isn't literally illegal and bears some semblance of safe for work"
me helping this person will be interesting because this time my age from this person is actually far apart. i’m way younger but i gotta think older and smarter
.
none of us have any knowledge in morse code, so we wouldn't understand it
anyway, i have to go to bed no-- hours ago thanks to time zones so bye
i don’t even know what that is
now i want pizza...
fine but if i go to bed before then i expect you to be honest

i might only have 1 class on tues/thurs also since i'm thinking of dropping the public speaking class since i took another english class that i thought gave me credit for public speaking
have you been mining for ore in the depths biome also
not just his poor performance
as far as i can tell it's just an in-house sequel to meme run
eating it
so id rather have 4 extra years of trying to get a job than 4 years of working up debt
all of my interests are video games <:lul:305559915714576385>
i dont really care what quality its in
that's not a person gummy
i could tell they were being flirty also
*the world isnt that black and white! from my perspective, im the hero and youre the villian trying to stop my valiant plan of setting the entire population on fire
because it is soooo important for me to self promote myself

minus ore seeds.
we're not going to use old copper tools

i meant blackmail becoming blackma- shit nevermind that doesnt work
wait you guys actually think that's actually that bad?
a true family
because she did the forcing/blackmail
i never show it though because i just mess around here
the civil war is so interesting, i really enjoyed reading about it
let's just say it had blackmail in it
i mean, i would just go and consider that an alt by technicality, but details
oh yeah just like ww1
oh trench warfare is wasy to understand
and early modern
his generals did everything for him
but they had the big bad usa on their side
that’s just really black and white to see it
it's worth a try
previous mistakes were repeated
the sad part is, the businessmen back home were profiting from all this
i can't at this point master
it was probably the fries that gave you away
peter the great
i don't know.
i see her bestie giving her a second chance though from what i have seen

sounds comfortabale for the eyes
also, did you try fighting skeletron already?

i was expecting ice cream tho tbh
-spirit
-calamity
and better bard bits would've helped me do better too. <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>

it's fine, wolve.
ah yes, the bees.

ok i got panda set up
im not making another.
canterlot equestria
i'll tell you about flubs pm
and bramble i guess but i bought that like 5 seconds before we won so it didn't count
speaking of playing, we just beat plantera in our game
this morning the same was true for me but that was because i'd just been feeding the sheep
you have a biased sample
i am slowly learning more on how to talk like her
it’s not
bass
its a rating of how often something appeas within a given set
not that, you ninny.
just walk away slowly, animal man.
and say "thats what i was gonna do"
heartgold and soulsilver
cosplay as rarity
it's pokemon black and white and according to drago black and white was amazing
if you wanted to put on makeup that implies you don't have any makeup on.
good luck on that
rc wanna see the full pic?

you know who was also a good tsar?
and now they exist again
they just don't have electricity in the siberian areas where it's happening <:keepo:327304799919800321>
i already explained it to like idk
but nah, gummy, as much as you want to help everyone, remember that it isn't your problem, as bad as that sounds
jeez i didn't make much progress there and i'm already feeling tired
the way overhaul changed picks annoys me like how it annoys ida
super balanced
antiaris is being made by the official tremor team.
but tremor itself is being maintained by someone else.
the hallowed megaphone
midnight?
a rarity plushie and a tricorne/bicorne hate
that's peanuts at our point in the game.
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
(the one problem with that is i'm trash at modeling robots)
i might've forgotten the recipe
ho-oh
i think that's calamity
idk never played it either lol
drago these are one of the few times that it is necessary
i.e. spreading jungle to fix our corrupt jungle issues.
i thought panda meant me for a sec lol
its gotta be true
i haven’t played overwatch in a while
my favorite kind of idiot is the guy who goes on webmd and is convinced he has x horrible disease. what the doctor says doesnt matter. he has it. minor foot pain after hurting your foot? brain tumor. ate too much and your stomach hurts? 5 ulcers.
do not participate in the life ruining juice
why eggplant?
henlo wolve
now the npc is attacking me for no reason : (
i'll record a gif of it once i get it looking nice
only it was for like 10 minutes
yeah, that might be treason
rarity pkushie made in the uk
classmate rolled his truck after drinking and driving
especially since they make ones not in the uk
at least say she
but i take the blame
i lived my life trying to get good enough that i would be worthy of her
just not as much as actual smoking
everyone said it
when you least expect it
im bored
not the fictional one
physics is evil
honestly knowing me since i can’t fit a mlp song actually i might but i am leaning towards a military song
just stand there while everyone dances
hello.
no, it is literally the opposite
i reversed your message
you know rainy is right flubs
b/w was meh. the sequels are much better. x&y was bland. oras, i like but i definitely prefer emerald.
in the newer generations they kinda made red a pushover
that's not pony stuff
platinum was the last game to have it
gummy its totally bc its you
at least she thinks im lovely
we all did
and maybe add a feature to have us remove them without having to go into the logs
that’s photoshop
ahem ahem *cough* enlightened ahem *cough*
you hate this place flubs
fleshlight
im almost tempted to rebrand now but have no idea what it would be to
its in
coffee drinker
that's the smell of nature, you fool
even the decent ones are just not realistic
i kind of gave up once i realized i'm the ranger and ranged weapons drop my fps to shit
it just might overhaul though.
that's a good idea.
i used mainly jgrasp.
they charge money for use of the mods content.
sorry.
ehh effort
how'd you even get it?
well thats on you for not seeing the future to this exact moment at age 6
so if i had to guess

ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
more than you
label?
i’m still not there...
honestly i’m not as big of one but i’m excited for captain marvel
gummy what you gotta do is get close to the person, then once you learn about their weaknesses just take them apart point by point until youve deconstructed their whole life
your feet
yeah me trying to pogo myself onto my desk using one hand
e!will
making flubs regret having faith in humanity, you can do quite well
how do you do that thing where you split the sheet in half in google docs so taht you can have two columns of text on a page?
seriously my cabinets have chips and other snacks, my drawers have cookies and other desserts, and my shelves have high quality spices
idk why my classmates made a big deal about it
i watched the trailer
i can't find my stress ball
it's not a kingcorphish repeat

you are not, you delusional bird
also, nice zeke pic
it's a loot magnet from luiafk.

anything else?

11k gold in the bank
this clip is a very low standard for both faith and a very high standard for humanity
she was having a nervous smile
so all the other consoles and pc can play together
why is there an actual currency based on garlic bread
how the hell did you get that
garlicoin, actually
like that?
i really question the use of math sometimes
you're gonna need to be using problemsolving
but im not about to fucking wall mount a third
because i'd like math to teach me the practical aspects of it, and then have something else give me critical thinking skills
y'all just hatin
i have tons
they weren't stupid enough to not learn from their mistake tho
is rarity an old lady confirmed?
cs4 might've been the latest version i used
im 5 11 but have tiny hands and feet
no you aren't
my parents dont know what patreon is and that';s probably a good thing
what is spelling
i just wear shoes bigger than my foot
i know, with the money i have, if i had to start paying rent and other payments, i wouldn’t have any left
i need to go do homework and discord is too distracting
i can't stand that stuff
i was responding to stuck's last message to me
urgh, i should sleep too. but this is the first time ive gotten to write real code in a few days and i'm trying to fight the withdrawal
brb screen break
that’s not a lot
it's not too big a deal just annoying
because i know for sure no one will get it right, even flubs
get to it
if things end up going to hell when you and cadance have that chat, then i'll just pin it on dragonite
greetings, cadance.
may 29
i might end up with a 50 something in bio today as well
...what?
shockwave flash rarity?
if mr cadance ever asks me again why i like rarity, i got a list.
i see someone tried to murder squid again

i was expecting skyrim but ok drago
botw, the yiga clan hideout in gerudo

i'm still in pre-hardmode xp
if you wanna cover your tracks besides aren you should not be friends with your main account
i can't find the one i knew about
but yeah im done finals and stuff
yeah, we do
i'm not going to be held responsible for the death of the bot
some previous test subjects have been able to. others not so much
it reminded me of you
damn it
what the hay
"the funeral is at 6:00, please be on time"ypoo
too late
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
besides that dude from pokemon

doesnt help me figure out who tf owns the discord beta testing server tho
well ida we are nice siblings
great now i have self-confidence issues
owo this is interesting
maybe it was like a proto-proto-proto-proto-proto-proto phonograph and they just slapped on the video later
into everything...
im soon gonna start dumping a lot of my stuff onto the pentium that we have and is like 80% empty of a 1 tb
"genious"
real white chocolate chip muffins are chocolate muffins with white chocolate chips inside
the case shouldn't affect your flash drives like that
i want a muffin
but when you type `main` in with a capital m you need to manually input {} later on for your code to run
not entirely sure why that needed to be pinned
or would that one warrant the gpu approach?
you need a 3ds and money
i dont want those nsfw ones tho
a pint is a good "i have 10 minutes and feel like destroying myself" snack
that was her ice cream
you have a lot of liquid nitrogen
<:lul:305559915714576385>
i'm honestly more excited for that time around since i'll be playing gunner xp
mmmmmm the ground
i assume you are talking about your grandma, and if you really want her to shut up ask her about m-81
👋 bye bye overhaul i never want to see you again
i don't want there to be too much lag
not even kidding.
can't too tired
yeah i was wondering before when you first said it
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
how about that weather?!
eew gross why do you have poewrpoint and onenote pinned
<:lul:305559915714576385>
and that's just one item.
fibus lusec wecos vinosec

i needed that after dinner snack
in a holy shit my mouth is burning but i'm also hungry kind of way
and while they use modern guns they actually wear colour uniforms
like i said
now it's a force schedule your video
thats how you are supposed to upload now on twitch i gues
how many views
everything?
we already know what you're gonna pick tho
this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
i also get my ass beat my the main villain in the final battle
not that wand, ,flubs
good
this is the kingdom of zeal
so i don't have to do that ^^^
even with a job
they're just going back and forth with this
*pokes gummy with a stick* xd
you already do, ninny
probably could but this dress is expensive
also i came very close to mistyping "weilds ass" which would be a sight to see
i would like just enough to be higher level than gummy
that doesnt answer my question
you are not joining
you didnt change your number tag yet
i do
why do i have the bad feeling he's going to abuse that emote
it's not this video is a test run master
you really like to steal doors, huh rc
:spinning: x3
they gave zoo empire an 80%
!rank
i wonder if "greater masa mune" will ever be a thing. <:thinkingking:325447327940870145>
darling
how dare somebody play my champ
it's fun
i'm afraid to join vc xp
~~one of us. one of us.~~
when
basically a color override.
you killed my father
on ps3 anyhow
i wonder what other rank ups could’ve been
i'm sculpting models right now, squid.
!rank
i see.
did you see the pic rc?
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810>
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
wasnt an issue yesterday or before tho for some reason...
get the chat to fight and blow things up
the world doesn't revolve around you, gummy.
it is
wait thank god squid is now pink
~~dont worry squid, i never will.~~
henlo shade
he’s going to die
remember magic wand
flubs
i arrive back
i love hnnngggg-ing

figured out how to make a brachistochrone in excel
duke nukem reference.
what is with all of the icons
nothing, like that
you are not worthy
oh hey, you're dunban now, rc?
another eagles touchdown
eating
drago is the winner
darn
how do chips get priority over wifi
my tradition is just not watching the game
i tried
damn misspelling...
so before i went to sleep today i figured out the formular to graph a brachistochrone and ive also added 2 new features to the bot
"greater masa mune" was the purple override.
skarm is always either violent or lewd, i'll have you know
e!bot
what game is it?
if i was going to get an emote it should be more me this time
adventurous
~~what if you don't know what race you want to choose, wolve?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
a bit of both?
no its a color
dammit (follower name here)
i just smashed him since my first character was built to kill mages
i don't really have any followers tbh lol
he's trying to get in my ear
he's too busy spending two thousand hours in terraria
plz repeat stuff
it's fun
they let you on phones last year in spare
my catchphrase is better
plus a server which is connected to the dm
ok i got a new email to redirect all my college spam to... took me long enough
pot meet kettle, gummy
that's not good news
did i just walk in on something here
i never guilt trip you
or twenty
it’s annoying to the bot that animal man is a guy?
reminds me of myself
i might end up leaving
oh wow almost like i have experience being an asshole
you gotta sometimes make the call that a community would be better off without someone weighing it down. that's not a decision you should have to make frequently nor take for granted but sometimes it's what it comes down to
i eat babies
okay well now she msg the dm and idk if i wanna say anything or keep quiet
no no lets
but drama is fuuunnnnn
goood gummy
or pregnant luigi
i wanted to be blue :c
the adage is "half your age plus seven"
plantera is one of the bosses and you break a plantera bulb to summon it.
but until that day
the bot is taunting me
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
im no friend of his
never most likely
how goes things?
um thanks rainy
let me guess: same person?
<:wutface:327309186432237569>
how are you?
because flubs is more fun
i'm not fun
darn i thought it was genetic
i probably have a cs, latin, and pre-calc test all tomorrow
not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
officers!
oh, and there's also the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by the means of books.
could be worse rares
enforce strict equality throughout the entire source code.
and that too
wow before premiere it had quality options
i had one once
irl, i have no patience
keyword: should
i will never understand why anyone like it. unless you are a poison type lover
i think ida doesn’t like me now 😛
anyone here have a good recipe for pizza sauce?
ida what else do you thinki do that’s a waste of time?
probably but gummy is known for being solo and lonely
great suspended turned out to just feel annoying for me
no one talks to him
why's that?
banked garlic bread from ~~scratch~~ raw ingredients
notice the "man"
kaiser
dazzling is next at school then
every kind of doughnut violently smashed into one megadonut > all alternatives
btw i told her what you told me flubs
doesnt mean he cant react with them
love being the hypocrite here
i thought it was fairly obvious :c
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
heh heh
new super mario bros ds was another option but i done the let’s play 4 times and it requires the bot screen
youre still weird though
brb looking up how many joules are spent in an hour long bike ride at fifteen mph
i reset the game
programmer art sound effects
i didnt do an analysis but it happened to me two or three times
no one but me
so i just made some more pure gb today
it’s been more than 15 seconds since he last said something
whelp.
youtube/twitch
archive them somewhere or something
you think we should hold off for updates?
im allerguc
i’m nit picking probably haha
close
your advice worked
in that case the response wouldve been very carefully
you didn't ask for a good explanation
also kicking the creator of the bot on that server isn’t a good idea as well
welcome to zeal simulator 12kbby
no squid that’s inappropriate
use sylveon lol
however if i do choose a new pokemon it will be oricorio
said you were
and they want to outplay inflation in profits i think
drago loves me squid
no 5th supergummying youtube anniversary

im too busy trying to sing chant du départ
i mean if worse comes to worse (i have no idea if i used this right or if it's written properly) you could always use the *"legal"* roundabout method of installing windows. although, idk if you can do that on a laptop.
time to scramble
also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
i just checked and i think it’s getting close to 20 more
not the greatest.

conflict?
i could have done 1804 or 1815
what kind is it?
yes it was dumb bird
now it feels like the bot is being sarcastic
it's not that, it's just that my internet is going to make things a pain because of constant buffering
there's another good response
oh that makes sense
welcome back, aqua.
i am
nope
i somehow win despite not being in any part of this.
when i wake up its a blank slate of "~~where am i to go me johnies~~ no idea what to do today"
kk cya

sleep is for the weak.
dragonite, smack him with a frying pan if you please. =w=

funny how my jerk friend is on my side for this one
also a few milling subscribers and a thriving youtube channel but that's beside the point.
this is what i look like
whenever people ask me whether they should do this or that in a video game i know nothing about, i tell them to "follow your heart" works every time <:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
wow, grade a english on my part
what was i being thanked for
i’m not drinking anything
and now it's rubbing it in. <:lul:305559915714576385>

it is beyond my comprehension how someone doesnt like salmon roll
i thought you were homeschooled though
e!dragonite-b
that good?
awua
raw fish?
i mean there's probably a way to program the bot to remove reaction if it was added by someone else
i question how effective that solution is
pay eyan $5 and that'll be a yes
you have to look really close and cross your eyes and poke yourself in the face with the arrow tip
enhanse
idk about htat one
and that’s not green
never thought i would see this day

sup nerds
well go do it then, i'm too lazy to do it

okay, because that previous message confused me
does that kill
are you telling flubs that's the decision you made that he won't agree with
<:coolstorybob:327305348698603520>
because it's not
because i'm busy doing other shit

oh...
whyd you do that
a crane
i wouldve
it's referring to samus' mother-like position with the baby metroid.
it's like that one tradition where an idea has to be approved while both drunken and sober to go into action
"hey!"
they could just be lazy as hell and just make it a 7th gen port
for chrome?
and no, mother 3 is not confirmed
i also like just drunk ideas in general
i'm calling a delay here, it still seems too early
wait i havent added taht
<:pcmr:305892755014418435>
good mentality
it is
each word drawn from a list of ~1 million
there are 9 words per sentence
don't feel like changing that anyway
hai everyone <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
that wasn't a pun
and then all the frogs float into space <:kappa:374346980136058893>
or alternatively: looking at the abyss
skarm, no.
they're glitchy
where is he?

whomst
oh darn i missed a stream
dayum

good
again, are we dealing with the bot or gummy at this point
but there are two people dedicating their entire lives to fish
xcom
thinking like a game designer
it's been fantastic
they're waiting for andi to donate so they can ban gummy.
oh i didn’t mean it like that
i'd pay money to ban this entire server just because i enjoy anarchy
"shouldn't you be making headlines by now?"
i won't be able to disconnect the two for my entire playthrough
honestly i kinda believe andi would do something crazy like this
from what i heard, she was a no-show sunday. she first called and said she couldn’t work, she got a court summons. but, the supervisor who answered the call called her out and said that the courts are closed on sunday
the end
what are we preparing it for?
~~are we eating chicken?~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
but are we eating the chicken?
the date
i changed my mind
a little bit of both i’d say
*burns snapchat* there was no use to that anyways
im weird
iirc
master controls fibus
okay was it the bot or the game that dragonite was referring to, in terms of the image.
i demand violence
flubs?
time to ask everyone to follow me
even talking about treason is treason
i should get it, but again...lazy
wrong person, damn you
you can stop with your pickup lines now
i said dragon, not dragonite
connection issues
it's just getting better and better.
x&y has always been hated

it probably won't, but it also probably will
try getting on my level (14)
he said go minimalist on it so it probably isnt gonna make it
i doubt he meant *those* kind of things, flubs

smirking got me to level up 😃
i have no idea what that's supposed to mean
why have you been doing that up to now?
no skarm turn yourself in!
that took years to make
only reason im not aggressive in civ was ida telling it’s not a good idea
and they started asking me advice
you caught me
it's just my alt dont get excited
(drago, put an icon on your alt, you lazy bum)
yay!
dangit
i return with cake

nintendo should make all the main pokémon games available on either the 3ds/wii u virtual console or if the switch ends up getting a virtual console
youre in love with a pony other than whatever that one is called
okay, i just saw a skyrim mod that turns the dragon you find in helgan (the name escapes me at the minute) into charizard.
damn
i wish i could.
....drago
i think
should i set the starting counter to like 2?
skarm knows all
well im france and france surrender after the napoleonic era
turns out, if the subs don’t watch x amount of videos as they come out, they just straight up don’t get notified of the video
but they are at war with me
something something ritual of the ancestor moth
i enjoyed my time with it, but not as much as other entries in the series.
inb4 it's a ragnarok drop
i try to have a 10-7 sleep schedule.
i just dont recall the mini character items being thorious
flubs calls a lot of people that rc
i’d listen if i wasn’t in public
the "asshole" actually inform me what was happening
then have someone else do it
ok, who was the queen disguised as in the phantom menace?
whoops
im hungry
yeah that’s how you spell it
panda sneaking around
i talk about characters and people i find pretty looking
correct.
why not do some deep thinking?
or we eat out
how so?
alright. i’ll pm you mine
you get to see kangaroos though
the best thing i can make is a first rate ship
is there a good mod to make the guards dialogue slightly more realistic in skyrim? because going from "pst, i know you you are, hail sithis" to "let me guess, somebody stole your sweet roll" to "what is it? dragons?" doesnt seem quite right
darn! how dare that country actually defend themselves!
greetings, bella.
remember screw the brits, screw the danes, and fuck prussia
might fill the spot with mario kart or something
now what?
i’m going to burn britain down
i will plan a new overlay and sidebox for platinum

it’s a union
i love it when someone babysits me
mo but that has happened
you know that website that majestic sent you a while ago?
and theoretically you cant trick your brain to be happy but you can force it to be
the part i don't understand is the system of magic used in chrono trigger
gummy, just tell an agent that you are a terrorist, then  you won't be going anywhere
an artist must work in the shadows to serve the light
no remember you were the father
have you even tried my new season?
./confuse
no, i think it’s regular.
i still havent done the golden claw sidequest
caps lock is on
t=-15 minutes to class and i'm the only one in the room
im so mean
i could do it now anyway or i could, like, not do it now
wait what time does he stream tonight?
have fun
oh hey will

i doubt theanimeman or any other anituber will act like it existed

hey master dont mine that mine, that mine is mine!
we need you to throw some people for squid

on it.
i just found out about that
depends on the weekday
dessert
i love gossiping for some reason
even a lot of people who don't like gen 5 like n
~~and lags you if you don't have a good pc.~~
halfway to reddd
i assume for the video-game variety?
be nice to the coffee machine skarm
holy fuck everything in switzerland is expensive

gotta love free destruction level ups
whats the level cap in skyrim?
e!react 431604441700106250 👍 s
here's what i know regarding those 3 distros.

you lack the required spacing
and i already saw it a couple times. i am subscribed to him <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i would go
the quest should still be in your to do list tho
they give you other buffs
so must make an anthem
did you see drago?
she insinuated some very rude things about my ancestors being related
a lot of things
and took the free money
im not looking for ping time
they have a food about it
at least it kept recording
i thought you could just type throw error into a function?
my league client has failed catastrophically
good job
okay, that's kinda great.
hey, i was going to eat that squid
which is a shame, means i missed out on pizza delivery sivir

wolve, you're a grnius.
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
:feelsannoyingman:
from shadows of almia.
uh oh.
plus, you can’t take pokémon out of certain areas until post game. and the 2nd and 3rd games have side quests
*sees new pin* <:lul:305559915714576385>
~~but you could use psyduck~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
later, squid.
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
wowsa.
boring
and it uses jpeg images
its a collage of 3 images one of them being negated and all of them being mirrored diagonally
but why do physics gnomes make sleep?
yeah
terraria: a game a lot of people play that i have no interest in <:kappa:374346980136058893>
it's the perfect pink nu quote
i got a really good paxel and scepter.
now that that's over with, can i wipe my rank and start over?
because they feel like it
you mean loot cubes with a mob spawner?
was there 8 of them? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i died for the xth time. good thing i have plenty of max revives that can’t be destroyed or taken away from me

it's mostly cats playing musical instruments
random thought: ok, so for lunch, i had a chicken parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
oh yeah another great thing about the db
but does a tough battle make a good character?
shadowmere
please dont blow up dan
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
my soul is an eye
that works too i suppose

hey thats what i heard
oooh sounds tasty
i mean i never talk there either, but it seems like a friendly community
feelsfrogman
these are dark magic bombs
wait what the fuck theres a bards college in skyrim
plus daedric hand
remember, im pushing for the skyrim/prequel meme crossovers
my word against yours

<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
while im trying to also work on another monitor
in black/white, i went back to nimbasa to fight the trains there all the time.
firered omega (at least the version i have) doesn't back-implement mechanics.
nice giratina icon
im just saying i like seeing them clearly
master, are we going to have a single house for the npcs or several houses that we build up over time?
anime titties
now i just need to come up with good designs for it
this again?
(i'm not really, i just hate the taste)
yeah you definitely know when you got it
thiccccc
you can narrow down the suspects
mr meatball nose
i think we’re talking about this because i mentioned not feeling well
that changes nothing
i was about to say and you thought diver was good
the fork is a weapon. it deals 1 damage and cant be boosted.
yay i got occlusion culling to work
"if it ain't broke, don't skittying fix it"
work is never fun
it cant be eaten
solstheim
ehh, i'm no bitch unlike apparently the rest of the internet, i love the snow
and all of a sudden, i feel tired...
correction: if had some entertaining features in the netcode
activate work sleep
i just got back from work
and no
that's what i thought
oh then that's your fault
good, it's working
what story
oh dear
the ocean one?
i never play competitive games though, i've always been a solo player
i’m back from work ya ninnies
im confused now
like what?
shoving off to sleep, was nice knowing you, etc, dont burn the place down, etc, etc, etc
too bad this is fireproofprooffire
unless his discord username is different now.
i've actually started using items less since i've gotten better at the game.
if i have kept all the attempted footage then i might've considered making a blooper reel at the end of the video for the heck of it lol xd
100% oj, 2d game.
step 1: open the computer
welp guess ill go kill alduin for the first time
and now im gonna feel like an asshole when it turns out he had a perfectly valid reason not to come in
reminds me a little of world of final fantasy with the chibi-like characters.
ughh, i have to do bleak falls barrow to do the civil war?
fucking bullshit
and it's causing hadvar to skip around helgen
you got it
argonian?
thats how high up we are
i feel like my eyes have been opened
yes but why
because that sounds violent
you ate some thing edible
tell the physics gnomes to stop fucking around
doesn't hurt that dragoon has like always been my favourite ff class
avicii was just found dead
seems i must have my 50 million tabs of terraria wiki open again
<a:peepocheer:422063843938926602>
*shrug* the instructions said not to
never got into him myself but yeah

is it bad that i can only assume that's m.website programming?
butter luck next time
no, that is incorrect
this is healthy
it deletes a quarter of its messages when  there are more than 8k messages
i know
is there a problem with 5 minute intros? because ive been working on one i think is pretty nice.
and to answer draco's question, i didnt feel like having it pm me or routing it to a channel in the log server
someone enlighten me on how that qualifies as a "meme"
defuq does that mean
it's because satire's not actually at all different from what it's mocking
sounds good
well, this was ~~boring~~ great. back to work...
i had a few gold.
well i found my 5 weapons to go for in pre-hardmode.
okay, just wanted to make sure it's fair game even though it's in another world
ahh, i get that from eyan
you idiot
until next time, gentlemen.
good luck with that
hmmm
list all the methods of lcass corpus
hint: the middle three always evaluate to "true"
why wouldn't i?
thank you kind sir
okay anyway im sleep now
save the flubsing the place down for flubs
lol, got a clam cane farming for sea stars
good job
well i like luigi for reasons other than dabbing
play some portal two. theres a part in there where he kills you.
when i started, i didn't know how to screen record
movie maker is nice
no you just havent caught up with death yet
but i don't feel like editing video
although i broke that trend.
do i get another trophy for level 60?
you fit right in here. =w=
won't have to do those things for another year
jsut started derivatives and theyre fun
just the one.
oh nice
we didnt do much abs in precalc
and by recently i mean a few months ago
for example on the ti-30s if you type in -1^4 you get -1
the formula was n² + n - 1
but when n = 14 you get 77 which is composite ;/
why are we talking about trees now
if you were told simply to disprove a formula's ability to only generate primes then why do you need to make a new formula with the same objective?
hang on
it's confirmed, there is a 2nd spaghetti
then you should try engaging more with your viewers in the video, giving a question of the day (kinda like what eyan's done in the past)
that is new
assholes need lessons taught to them
so clearly he knew he screwed up
he made me face palm so hard
yea, fun fact i never named my chanel after him, i was trying to be original but still naming myself after something related to space
he was trying to say how much of a hypocrite i was being, when literally i was doing nothing hypocritical in any regards. granted i could've articulated my response much better, but still
or given my personal rating
hotball1 is, to date, the only person who's ever beaten bloodbath on 60hz
yeah that one's super hard
hotball is undoubtedly the best in the world right now
though i think my days in the game are numbered, since i dont want to get a 144hz monitor for just one game and one game only, and i dont even think my laptop can run that type of monitor
looks like java doesn't care master lul
how would you plug that in?
and by that i mean ill do the throwing shit at it for you
now we just mash ctrl+k once we dont have any error messages
speaking of things going horribly wrong, im glad i bought a new mouse today since the one i have now is starting to work worse as time goes on
scishow did a video on them a while ago

let's give it a whirl.
85 is perfect
two things
anyway, are you free to try it at like 6 today?
can i just put dog as background and then take picture of computer background and then email the background to a test ipad at apple and then email off of that to a bank so they can print it on the back of checks?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i could get work done
oh wait no thats just the weather balloon thats on fire. the sky isnt on fire
but hes made of alcohol
ateveryone who here's life isnt a dumpster fire?
problem solved
that's slightly cheaper than my car
oh wait
~~greetings and salutations, gummy! welcome to the kingdom of zeal!~~
wait hold the phone
the nightmare was hard demon at one point
gummy can i be your best friend
gummy record a xenoblade chronicles lets play
how did the count rise to 5 tho?
oops
gummy you forgot the part where flubs and i set fire to things
that sounds even worse
and i have the one thats just a shell with kenobi's face on it

poo is stupid and i hate it
and noice skarm

but i want to play with libgdx
and become what you tried to escape
ice cream and brownies are the greatest things i've had in awhile
in the 3ds version sarah keeps beating me as jigglypuff
just finished physics class
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
looks like you've hoiked yourself into a wall.
before what?
what ~~class and weapon~~ bow do you have?
chocolate chip would just mean generally anything that isnt vanilla
nice
dated dec 2, 2011
public class dragonite{
arent sata cables generally easy to get a hold of though?
gummy arent you the one with the super fancy gaming pc
3 plz
that doesnt make you any more sane
*kinda*?
yeah close enough on the zeroes
i'm more used to people referring to it as 2π, in math
no please my brother help
now do it recursivley
i blame the english majors for making a shitty api
```
when was i supposed to learn this shit
why are you giving a math lesson to flubs? and flubs, it’s “mew”
can’t we just talk about video games or something entertaining?
you gotta do so much to make them not gross
as opposed to the double-precision one
it'll mostly be the mermen that are the issue
im back.
my dog would probably let you get away with that, too
anyway brb off to physics class for a lovely lovely test
maybe. that was 7th grade so i *might* not remember it
28 left
it's great
that chaos!
it’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; i still don’t like humidity
“press f for lamp”
and then went rogue.
<:lul:305559915714576385>
no. i dont even know what you gain from playing expert
i’d do it if i felt well
ah hah
oh no
i'm was never hired
i was, but it passed.
oh great!
happy revenge of the 5th everyone <:kappa:374346980136058893> is that even a thing? my friend who loves star wars said that so it must be, it oughta be.
this has probably been the best stream (counting yesterday) i have ever been to
in a text bubble.
make that 3 more.
ow and also my back
probably shouldn’t have sat on him...
what do you mean no. im like 90% sure hes my dog
"don't get me wrong, i love lamp".
he’s my dog now
20 secs to load pc

try and launch your worm as far as possible
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
figured i owe it to them
thats me, baby
100k!
excluding this ```java
eat it
never timed it though
i’m starting to believe i actually have multi personality disorder and it’s affecting my friends
private static final char m = 'm';
because discord devs are busy transfering the system over to a new something or other
wanna try it
dragonite.debts.master.owe = 0;
java framework for making video games
what were the questions?
he was saving it for a party tonight
do teachers know
not that
correct.
i have no opinion i am romantically involved with a weakling
i’m back from work ya ninnies
i just hope that the first time i meet any of you irl that my first words are "listen here, you little shit."
while also dressed in a modded chicken suit
my three month old mouse is having switch issues and keeps double clicking, fuck you logitech
well you don't perpetually speak musketreason, not here at least so that has to be at least partially wrong
my tavernkeep in terraria is named blacksmith
yes, but then the trash will return and still need to be taken out
so when does google make a nation and we end up in some dystopia where they own everyone
it seems we are at an impasse
do you what?
otherwise known as confetti gun fights
i love this
for once you didn’t collapse something
mmmh
and only assholes do that
i’m back from work ya ninnies
if i qualify then i'll be able to take pre-calculus ii and introductory physics in college this fall <:feelsgoodman:327315048252833793>
it’s fun
well yeah
how so?
btw thats what the college catalog says^
i've been a pretty diehard fan of far cry for a while
hahaha
so you do want to knowm
now the teacher walked in and he's talking about civ or something with one of the classmates
    }
thats true, maybe we'll get a gtavi within ten years then
and he’s using empire total war to help him learn...
because only high quality shitposts make it through
but rdr2 is on the horizon so they're gonna swap ~~cash cows~~ games
so you can still wingsuit in and land on a guy to kill him, but you can also take the dead guy's knife and throw it into the skull of the guy who was chatting with him
also i *finally* got a fucking hug outta you
shhhh
i kinda wanna frame it
nah rainy they were being crazy amount of bitch
what do you think?
it's 1:30 in the morning and i'm documenting my code
fuck
no, square the temperature
did someone say math lesson? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
then you are safe
that sentence doesnt make sense to me
backward is not an option
it's quite obviously flubs going in to ensure gummy trying to reunify everyone for the 4th era doesn't go south
reverse reverse
both
when a hazel and another hazel love each other very much
go faster than camera take picture
and i thought i worked out a lot lol
something about technicians
the flash
yeah, i think that’s important
see but next year we’re ditching and playing d&d
what here needs modifying?
* what went wrong:
could not determine java version from '10.0.1'.
did some cable management and how at 100 mbps
sure csi shows misuse it but its not the word's fault
slow clap
wanna make games with me and master?
it could also be "enunciate" but that's only a thing i have problems with
lol bob the builder
tell the friend to make games too
anyway if i can wrap my noggin around github ill let you poke through and make fun of what im working on
you dont have it still?
im a doof
real java meaning notepad++ and cmd/
if you go the long way instead of just using the formula theres like 80 points of fuckupability
i cant remember how it works now though
welp
3+4=5
so tomorrow can be like a testing day for me
i think 5-24-25 is also one
it's not
i like casios but the rest of the planet likes the texas instrument
oh gorsh
why?
yeah but 500 people will be watching...
youve been thinking to much, time to start doing
proudspire manor is a nice house...
im just not gonna show up
so far operation: one small thing is falling apart probably because it was a dumb idea
it was thanks to war that got me in this mess
idk who to pick though
yeah we know
sometimes relationships just take time to heal, other times it may be for the best that they never do
the only gold level tool you really need is the pick.
same
and year 2 fall
as the game has no ending
like doubling numbers
you're almost done the game if i'm not mistakne.
and try to get the kegs, theyre worth even more
theres those junimo huts you can get
but i guess i should be "stupid" about these things as my parents say
theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
its honestly luck of the draw
it's not like the class is experimental
and those varieties being longer means theres more to put in there
oh grad party will be safe
ill give you a hint, they wont be in a barrel
yeah but if a bunch of passwords leak from a site or something and you use the same one for everything, it doesnt matter how secure it is
why are you upvoting
why do you think i have a place to copy and paste them all in from?
and ok coworkers
it was funny to watch though
it's only once a year that you get to have a go with those hats
spoilers: everyone *except* jesus dies
oh nvm he's playing empire lol
yaya
~~phanpy.~~
because that thing is longer than my entire body and thicker than my forearm
only one way to find out
and the bed
stahp
and the process of throwing everything at animal man was repeated
it was only 20%?
either that or you put one of your "or"s in the wrong place
nom something
hes getting further and further away
also master yoru coding style is abysmal
but like
gummy uninstall
sorry drag am watching arrow season 1
2,000 feet minimum.
borderline drunk
>_>;
sorry to hear that
windows 3.1
<:lul:305559915714576385>
nah that cant be it
so tonight i finally get to relax with empire
know what would be nice?
it's "only" flirting with 3 here
electric cars are the future
wait until battery technology improves ida
way less pollution
i copied and pasted from the semi-working version on github
i can truly live in the 18th century now
yeah i know
we talked about the art of history
if i murder you tomorrow that'll be the future instead
i want some more twisted ice tea
also met a new friend at the party
@gummy's friend: chuck his phone in the lake
and gummy's friend seems a little bit degrading, is there anything else that you'd rather have us call you?
that was exciting
$1.26 a liter
get one for everyone here too
obviously
perfect
he said ‘thanks i really appreciate that’
gummy says ‘get out of my face i feel really insulted’
oh thats benny's
<:gwupugurithinking:390299785841606656>
she calls me a lot of things as well <:raritywink:278584590300348416>
i hope youre charging them rent
i forgot my wallet and came home
the grad date was yesterday though
go for it
smart bois
is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
is it all private?
go with 1 to not fall into their r/fellowkids shit
yall can laugh but i legit had a job in a lab one summer that involved an instrument called a "penetration penetroometer"
my final english grade is 96% :v
people just sub
i spent more time trying to decide what book to read
blugh people are annoying
i mean i've tried interfaces first hand and that explanation still doesn't help anything make sense
you need to plug them into the coaxial outlet with the xlr switch enabled
it's treason
so that way when you pass a potatosalad instance to a metabolish instance it knows it can extract that information
there's at least two in my colossal cave adventure knockoff that i sent you a few days ago
bella's going to yell at us again for talking about code isnt she
public class potatosalad implements nutrition```
no i thought i won...but i was literally on off...
it’s legit
you cant snort a condom
god i ate so much cheese today...yesterday
hi gummy ^w^
but im bad at that
oh yeah gummy
im just tired and wanting to play empire total war
ouo!
<:lul:305559915714576385>
dont you have class today?
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
all im doing is pushing myself
i'll brb
well they still dont make sense
hmm, making xenoblade fan game is hard
that sounds a lot easier
we know
same
though if i could i would
i need help
or something
melia+mythra>all
now i want a drink
what the skitty it's full of dog treats
a game?
~~or you could just be yourself~~
no a server
ok next is the trumpet blaring from the sky
she’s super cute
have fun
yeah
time to play singleplayer games and not save
skyrim no save run
holy shit
e gadd?
holy crap its almost six pm and nobodys done anything for dinner bye
that was fun
actually code that
?0.0225"?m  
wrong, it was "brb food"
night
barf green with chunks.
how many lurkers are there here?
it is
what?
i guess you aren’t hungry
obviously
good luck with that
i like to take credit for that
none of them are done well, however

camelot 2.0 is going well
so i have confidence that i'll qualify for the course
<:lul:305559915714576385>
gummy remind benny that im rooting for him
in javascript and game maker anyway
thanks you broke both my hands
in java decidedly not
nice
the following year students were not permitted to change the wallpaper
ouo!
<:gwcfcthonk:357907199928041473>
well it isn't
yeah, i checked myslf after i was off by  like 0.1 or so
normally zero
mfw i can take math126 and math127 both over the summer 😮
in practice: there's like a hundred fifty lines we'd have to do that to and neither of us has the patience for that
ok i have 40 minutes of photo transfers left to do
no probably going to copy paste chant du départ and change some words
whenever my (great?)grandparents were high schoolers
currently counting 435 photos
now you can use them for food preparation
that sounds like the villain from splatoon 3
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
that won't end well
1930s?
you people arent very good at this
they don't curse in this movie but they changed words up
(－‸ლ)
i keep seeing people spawning in with an obviously cheated in amount of coins
again?
i have a growing amount of dislike for these types of videos. if you're not into a game yourself that's fantastic, no need to ruin it for other people.
but yeah sing that song
fuck i’ll fix it on pc
<#305548986155008000> plz
could be
and awesome holidays
no bad apple
im perfectly happy on my own
and also it makes me a better singer
so i think the year my mom hit 18 they upped it
also i needed the territory of egypt which was own by the ottoman empire at that time so instead of declaring war and taking it, i did it the ida way
i guess that makes sense
your youth or your life as payment
i should sleep
sneak 100
no squid
rip lol
squid you can be the guru of the gutter
no rainy
lol true
greetings, will.
seems about right
i am glad i changed a few words
not from family but from my community
but now i'm a higher enough rank than her that we can no longer play competitive together
so, is eyan dead or still asleep? <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i switch between new saves and my main all in one
youre probably the only one who has
he's also playing terraria.
one was fine, the other was boring
also, lol rc
i remember one time we played guitar hero in math class
stick figures fte
i will smite thee
since when do i want to read?
i was just about to ask them
fool.
that was my family friendly version of dont do drugs and wear protection
have fun stay safe
flubs im getting too old
me getting old made me lose my throne
you missed the dumpster
drago can i borrow $30?
they are great
i can’t handle compliments from you
at least until the sun comes out again

the l word
i wonder if i can set my discord game to "discord"
and apparently not giving up
        });```
aurelion sol?
the dude who has a bone and the dude that is actually just his soul
the banished
sets their bones on fire
10/10 would make that mistake again
rii vah
i only explored like 30% of guar plains
that's probably because shadowplay doesn't record at like a terabit per second
ive only edited like fifteen or sixteen btw
i use 1080p60 for mine too but use shadowplay. stuffs a lot smaller
what does bitrate even change
your spleen hole is bleeding so much you must know something
oh like taco style of bowl?
she got me some fish bowl
the hell
idk what it is but it smells nice
my worst joke:
good luck
lasagna
or was some homeless guy hungry?
how many bits per second the thing uses to encode video
rainy you can die
<:lul:305559915714576385>
but it still exists
sounds like me
i’ll be a war teacher
i get it now magus

recursion is easy
duh, im eyans little sister

aaaaaaaanyway back to code

does this mean i can finally shoot someone with a musket?
*is back* freaking dragonite. you let the banished out
nooo
raw ym
flubs you gotta hear this

blanket buddies extracurricular
kangaroos in science class would be awesome
well now he’s pure alcohol
he can be like "here's how you dont do it"
no eyan is the school mascot
yeah dragonite birthed you, skarm
what are you gonna do
watch him at the casinos
does the school of zeal have a dark brotherhood chapter?
idk if someone wants to teach despacitounge or surrenderspeech
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
fuck you im the assassin

no you just make the calls to anyone who's not there's parents
you are joining my army
e!google dovahzul translator
im doing physics homework
i was thinking that
who's our pro ice cream rater?
wrong text field
custard is superior
just shot everyone
thinkingface
good enough
isn't it technically rereleased? cuz atma's was in season 3, i remember the warmog's atma's darius days
dude atma's + shoujin spear or whatever it is
darius, garen
i have with some people
self proclaimed title but made me aggressive and very bossy
alright gn
idk how to do that in discord though
well, i think i got a cold or sinus infection or something. yesterday, i couldn’t stop coughing and today, my nose won’t stop running
darn
on the subject of this school thing, i have made the executive decision as head of the gsa: gsa stands for gay shit ayylmao now
good news i have a way with words
nah, only requirement is that you laugh at a gay meme at some point
whatever floats your goat
oh boy i have to be proctored for a final in an hour and 20 minutes
except that one that rainy posted
never saw that show but heard good things about it, lol
i should probably do the same, night all
okay im a general
it’s alternate history
new informatiin
it makes me pass my classes
guys code red
probably closer to like 7-8 months, but yeah.
either way works lol
i missed the old me
not as much
at the very least i was lurking in here when you were talking about it <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
i hate algebra <:rooderp:399827526744014848>
i'm always hiding from someone <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
but i could
because it bothers you
nice
thanks
yeah
but if im being completely honest this science course was very good
yes rainy?
get sarah to beat him then
or drink yourself super sick and use that miserable morning as fuel to be sparing
were you just gonna uber everywhere? <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
also hot coffee on a winter morning is the only reason i'm not 100% atheist
why not
gas is expensive btw
i just like autumn because i get to wear all of my favourite clothing <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
thank you!
and my allergies got really bad
but im playing games and stuff right now
<:hellothere:305560404715896832>
i still can take the inverse of functions and boring stuff like that
why not
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if you know what that means
im taking two english classes this summer so yes i am quite dead indeed
sounds lame
man i love war
sleeping early was 3 hours ago
flubs flubs
what'd you do this time
how was it a good idea?
feel free to tutor me in math <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
good times
<:gwnanamilaceshrug:403295147892277249>
listen to war music
well a lot of stuff happened a while back which caused me to have to retake a bunch of classes
...yeah started drinking at grad party and now all i can think about it trying everything that’s alcoholic
i technically have to be somewhere at 10:30 tomorrow but i got like nineteen hours of sleep today so i should be good right
feels like i never talk to you guys anymore
i don’t wanna be napoléon anymore tbh i only wanna be him when i play my war games
man, i had some crazy pizza dreams last night, tripped the heck out
gummy stop making me stay up
i’ll go invite him to my friends server
now i kick my pants off discord
i know how to by passed the system
back to war
how do you not eat bacon
over 3200 pages
from my point of view what about the wookies?
i mean let's be real, xc1's menus are awesome considering the stupid amount of things that they do
no you dont lose your skyrim license, just your bard college position
oh i found it
oh there once was a hero named ragnr the red
if you find out let me know too i was wondering that
i have no idea how they got that
i pretty much just guess since 3/4 were correct
i just took the final, my grade isn't 89% it's actually 94% so soon i'll be the only one with a grade in the 90s lol
so i was actually going to do something productive but napoleon total war is calling me
history is better
i did all of them, i'm pretty sure
but napoleon total war
sadly i wouldn't know very much about that, lol
also a shrine
“do you know the definition of insanity?” vaas
ask ida on that one
strengthen the empire, weaken the thalmor
i just hate stupidity, in both myself and others
the stormcloaks wouldn't be able to face them
dammit, i wanted that
modern rap is like saying classical music
how about chant du départ
i hate everyone myself but i have a reason
and it gives you a source of dispensable npcs
then why side with him if you're gonna betray him anyways?
they make such satisfying noises when they die
i see falmer, i think chaurus, and become scared
they cause me to be stressed the fuck out
that's hakon you fool

it was an automated message <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>

apparently the subscription tab will no longer be im chronological order
i guess he didn’t like the rock
youtube has done it again...
brother's on the phone with grandma and he's in the process of having the same conversation for the fourth time and it's driving me mad
why would i need lock picks?
just woke up
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
it's okay youre not supposed to be able to remember elven names anyway
this is pointless
friends decides to troll in server
head of the institute
don't sully that name by bringing it up here
used that 4 cheese-blend
nice
what’s pride and predjudice?
the plane game was nice
and hey, i needed bones for my glove, might as well do it in the dungeon
speaking of which i kind of want to play smash 3ds now for no reason
brb looking for cheese
since everyone has a different role and in the same category
how about napoleon total war?
it is always the time for java jokes
with a sawzall and a blowtorch
i beat you in that
you suffer from a condition called not nerdy enough
yeah far
nvm master
what?
i dont remember that but that thought got a chuckle out of me
nothing happens
that's a surprising thing to hear from you
ww1 one page and was just about canada
you called it
the russian empire sucked after tsar alexander i died
nothing?
good job skarm

once again the asshole made me super mad
septimus singus has something to say about that
so are we
i have something very nsfw for you gummy

everyone here
dialga
same but that is a good one
i oneshot the jhin and ekko lategame with auto and maybe an e
“skarm is weird lol” nice pin

you don't need most of it
i hoik killed a dungeon guardian fairly early on and then we legit killed another as a group lateron.
it’s 7:32 and i already feel like going to bed. help
something about blue light
probably because javascript lets you do too many stupid things and would encourage bad programming habits early on
dp2 is almost starting soon
good
thank fuck
no watching nature
though i wish i did cape, i hate it when people mistake me for a *shudders* straight
it took me a while that you were not, in fact, talking about diamond and pearl
simpsons has been going on longer
tempted to qupte monty python right now but i cant quite remember the line
spongebob is better now
it was
wait the simpsons is still airing? i thought they killed that years ago

not too bad xd
i think rc needs to hang out with gummy more
thanks guys
i couldnt stand ash back in like season 1, where have you been
and once i find my mic i'll get on for what will probably only last until i either a) go meetup with friends to binge a bunch of shows or b) we decide to play the vidya games
damn i said cheese
now i want cheese
what foobar thing?
who was the asshat who called it foobar?
shush panda it's more fun to blame me
> dragonite
it's more or less a religion thats one of those stereotypical ones i guess
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
sometimes i wanna disappear
protip: don't take the story super seriously
no i don’t
it's deja vu all over again
did i say it was morning?
inebriated
/m,e hugs
fkubs
just saw deadpool 2
so does that mean you hate me
i call the english language the language of anguish
im seeing ads for barbecue and getting extremely hungry
if it's written out you can decipher, at this point with speaking i don't think you could understand if they used spelling or grammar correcty
sooooo
do you want an example of how dumb it is?
if you can make a sentence where the subject is not a noun, i will go drive off a cliff and forward the insurance check to you
flubs can you give me 10 examples of ideas that aren't a theory
flubs
that makes no sense
lol, day off, if only
i should probably talk here more
what separates an idea from a thing?
why does it feel like he never streams anymore
its monday
~~yourself?~~
have fun with that
ida!
because i kind of want to start over again
well then back to yelling at people for pinging other people
god damn it how am i still in the lead?
flubs you gotta watch this amazing show that i am currently watching
power rangers
i just meant like a ceasefire
what?
cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
camelot 2.0 is falling apart because i hesitate on decisions
sleep
~~i think skyrim is going to be on your phones now~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
very carefully. <:kappa:374346980136058893>
your bagels will be stole
can you ask her to let me finish my finals first
does dragonite not like bluej
like linear algebra, number theory, topology, etc
then i can get into differential equations
my university offers a multitude of stuff though
if i put the same effort into my other classes like i did math i'd be amazing at everything in school, lol
differential equations fascinate me, i wanna learn about those eventually
im just excited to read napoleon in america
it was invented when a supercomputer was injected with 12 tons of meth, 3 tons of weed, and a pool-worth of lsd
my ap history course for next year just assigned their summer project
not the best, but also not terrible
im pretty excited just to dive into calculus
what have they done?
yup looks like it
okay, now that i think about it, lets go is gen 1
<:kappapride:379352530863521792>
also we finally get to start with eevee
because gum doesn’t ban
so i just decided to make a text adventure rpg and implement sound
buy a tv
well shoot, ok
which kinda sucks too since i kinda need to rely on a phone to be in contact with my parents to know where to go after my lecture today
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
but you guys never talk when im here
if we’re taxing people now...
nice
and we kept saying no deal
time lapse snapshot
i throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~hole in the wall~~ window
nah i don't have a gba anymore
and yes dragonite i put sovengarde and the normal main theme both on there
i once won the jackpot on a deal or no deal game at an arcade
hai friends ^w^
no idea.
because i have no idea how to make an algorithm that will do this
i wanna come back to fun stuff to read
must not damage the pages
oh yeah
been a little while since auto pin kicked in
it appears he did not.
if anyone actually wants to see footage of my exploding footballs let me know, otherwise i won't waste space in the creative channel with it lol
c—a—n—a—d—a
eyan is starting the sequel to jersery shore
forgot about that one
did you even hear a word i said
e!google shannon selin
meh i hate how all my plans have changed
oh wait do you mean one that i actually use?
i did once
i think this is the 3/4 time
when i wake up in the morning, i instinctively look on discord and youtube.
have fun with the penguins, flubs
exploding footballs break?
i was going to say flubs' current missiles are probably more explodey but i guess not
brb food
he said music was gross
how bout, no
is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
n = o/u
i was in a squid?
no pink
as long as my pink is unchanged i couldnt care less
oh no
yeah because my voice is fabulous <a:rarityflirting:447509240043667466>
bc i have reason to
and <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
had to rewatch my stuff and i did do a good job
everything looks the same....
i'm sitting here uploading july's videos because that's how far ahead i work because i'm stupid
hmm what to pick
that's a little bit gross
but didn't you already graduate
time for new friends yes
i used to get called out of class just so i could go and study for it, it was bullshit
she has all of that besides science but she got an exception and she probably will pass her finals however she has two online classes that she is not done and if she doesn’t get them done she doesn’t get a diploma
racist
cool...if only the military was like what it was once wa
work
it was literally the same stuff you had already learned
i must say, it is rather amusing to be looking for an enemy that turned invisible and then finally when they turn visible again they're having a seizure on the floor due to the paralysis thing
boy were they wrong
no if you dont know what youre doing
relatable
and you arent even told what is incorrect,just that it is "incorrect"
oh yeah, it's officially gay month
join
im doing a rare editing stint so ill join later, probably
should be
what
im gonna work on this spreadsheet for like 10 mins and then bother gummy about starting up another conversation
missed the rest of stream, apparently. oh well.
besides i'll do it tomorrow
since i am free tomorow
i broke through the part on the left but still
so i would have to show photo id and all that jazz and yeah i may never get the account back or i might get it back
nice
also that separation makse sure you dont have any of the old stupid or edgy shit you put on the old one
albino umbreon
quinn
exactly. games are a form of art
this was a dream, now?
im going to yell at people today
your music taste sucks
im vlogging now guys
noms natewantstobattle
that song is describing me piece by piece
and basically ruin it
that counts
gummy be nice
i want to sleep, but i dont want to sleep
primaries
good job
new jersey
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
gummy i thought i told you to leave your fishing pole at home
im also here but in a different call with friends
um pimaster
did someone say bluej
i did it because i was in a rarity mood
you should know im a brony
for some people it is
personally, for me i would never even bother with the dock if there's a cable charger
random rare drop
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
yeah blame drago
im no private to you
right person, you thought wrong
there you go
i honestly don’t like muk
and only 1 line of ghost and dragon types; i never liked that
i love latin though
because those are funny
what level honors did you get?
“drago’s boil water”
for me
i probably shouldn't get too far into it but to give you an idea there was one hitler fan a few months back
they counted years by the two consuls they had that year, re-elected years were weird i guess
they were like "the sun moves over a day"
she is my official helper now
i thought it was that some assholes got lazy and just sent the fucker to the future
unfortunately, i missed this friday
taking latin 4 next year then ap latin
a good assassin relies on air existing around them
temportal nightshade
the infinity stones have two parameters
im a rogue with max dexterity and proficiency bonus in stealth. no one catches me
hence parameter in your lungs
and it's 4:30 so it's because i'm an idiot
ehh, not a fan of doimg this
oh memes are weird
okay another issue with discord.js: the documentation is trash (at least on mobile)
nah just make it less spaghetti
my bot is being developed in java.
can it be done in java?
yeah
(long pause)
and we learned how to graph them on a graphing calc
i dont do it for the server. i do it so that only i can have onii-chan's love
shh questioning it only makes it stronger
if not vision of them
yeah you guys will have no idea where i got this name from
bella we are nerding
brb gonna get some ribs
guess who i said
be more specific
mommy works too
nice
while some people wrote boring things like hockey player
im msging someone to ask for a price for a plush
brb sleep or something i guess
rc gets what life is all about
is anyone else not seeing comments on youtube videos because of "restricted mode" even though restricted mode is off
i wrote down i was emperor, huge warlord, have absolute power, and my wife is rarity
hai friends ^w^
love how rc said don't go overboard
well yeah
why?
i am making bios for each pokemon lol
im bored
id make a darwin project video but it doesnt work well with shadowplay
yeah i assume it was you with that one as well lol
as a definitely oppressed gay, i demand these shoes for free
asshole 2 is blocked
garchomp and vaporeon as well
how'd research on d.js go?
im bored and there are all of three other people in the room
so are they advertising homophobia?
(sarcasm)
i've seen ads on neither cause a) i use adblock and b) i don't use twitch
yea lul
reading that sounds like work
"hello, i like money" - youtube
dammit
no thats star geezeers
she went through a 16 ounce shaker of that powder parmesan cheese in less than two days
is that saurkraut?
*cheese* is good
for a video essay it would
but it’s nearly impossible to fail here
anything that is 50% or over is a pass
whats wrong about senior skip day?
you cant punish a student who doesnt give a shit about school
and im quite sure that the failing grade was a 65
for us
yeah, theyre looking at their phone. how would they know someone is talking to them if they arent listening?
hey drago
darn asshole can’t vc with me while i film
or youre missing the button
i havent been bullied since 6th grade, which also happened to be the last grade i stayed in a public school setting
im gonna stop doing that one day
in elementary that is
how convenient
wanna add me?
help i forgot to switch onto my non-speedrunning version of the game
one requires 100% headshots on enemies that teleport randomly in a game with bad hitboxes
its so glitchy d:
and its so good to kill in it
we lost to the toilet of the major leagues
i wonder what dragonite's dietary councellor tells him during their meetings
psst, i know you who are. hail sithis
this time i said something along the lines that she would get fired less than a day
damn thats pretty...okay
woah
i am always busy now
only here master
you only do public insanity?
they are talking about star wars
in xenoblade or pokémon or skyrim
well if all the singers do it then its a part of the song
the singer just fucking slows down mid word
dragonair and ????
go home
mine: 
oh, that’s my day tomorrow
i just build the houses
45 seconds in them: "alright please stop we'll remove you from the list"
and that game uses a butt ton of real songs
that’s why i said i **had**
check back in like a month once i actually get some of these things carried over
i mashed 1
"3d printer"
i have no idea what to do all summer
wait i made a list
i have to smash it against my desk until it comes apart by divine intervention
see he's ready
bleeeeeeeeh
truly the ultimate pokemon adventure
posted a thing in blackbird
idk master is the guru of names
and i like to pretend to be him
do stab and boom at the same time, booab, or stoom, whichever floats your goat
i'm biased, it has the word princess in the title
tastes like licorice
rip i can't change my server nick to "dragonite - guru of life and laziness"
he misses being aggressive
yeah otherwise gummy would be running around with a picture of upside-down rabbits also
or 4
12 more days until the old gum turns 18
and im hungry
for high school math classes i've been using composition books with 100 sheets (200 pages total) and for college math i've been using 200 sheet (400 pages)
that seems like too much
im watching the news about a killing husky
also did you level up recently?
is that right outside the window?
actually
also did my precalc final exam today
while master is doing teh maths im also doing math lul
at my school, you had to take 3 years of gym
im still on the fence of whether gym is evil hellspawn of satan or a fun time for all
nah already completed my required 2 years, but i'll still get up and exercise like i do so i dont die young lmao
kill him
im not named brad
im lucky enough unpaid gigs count as service
the majority don’t try at all
ohhh i see
today is international jelly donut day
the <:kappapride:379352530863521792> pe teacher
bully
get over here
things i do to watch the new pony episode
and the color depth is amazing.
now i need to watch eqg shorts, finish tmnt, finish justice league action, catch up on teen titans go...im missing a show
i dont believe so
this dehydrated milk and sodium blend is not
huh, no scratches. i should go play with the rabbit again today.
woah is that pixelkmon
beep boop

i didn’t
the blue jays are winning but it's against the orioles so it doesnt count
bottom one master
no no
idk how to read baseball scores
they are 3rd in al east
i know
i meant the commies
brb now food

i'm teal you fools
well too bad
<:doit:334014889137930240>
now you can
the russian army mostly had peasants as troops, they only had 200,000 regulars
actually eh
you can't tell the future? what are you? a level 17????
ban yasuo
(just testing stuff)
flubs is a race
i’m killing rabbits in minecraft pe version
fast food
but i wanna go to 3 places only available in certain states
wont this just slam my face into the ground
who said we were driving?
i got her bugged in the one dungeon with the tiny platforms on the shaft downward
she was still following me in boolean but was stuck on the platform for like 80 load screens
wont this just launch me upwards and then into a spin where i then slam my face into the ground
it's awesome
thank
squid you're slacking on your job, you're supposed to give out baconators to people
pokes fish
it was in the baconator that you ate, majestic
wow, gummy just got destroyed
gummy stop getting deatroyed
i just got back onto discord
again
my picture was flipped, but i changed it to something else a couple months ago. and now back to this because i didn't have the original saved
jokes on you i'm on summer break
im not : (
slow clap
who said emile is here?
it was the rival nickname thing in crystal/soulsilver
and then questioning why he's doing any of that work
anyways where was i?
i think sumo was kind of a last straw for him
he blew up back then because of an algorithm change.
with the whole "the only people here"
beep
and a gf thats helping with the depression but makes the youtube comeback take a bit longer
dont even attempt pink. it will destroy you
!leaderboard
okay thats it brb
some of them are for pink nus, others are eyan memes
stop making me feel old .-.
good job master
unfortunately yes
most of us do
dont get dragonite started on faces
socks are hard ok
*throws a blanket over flubs head* shut up
but i already said that about the 5 emotes
(◕ ε ◕)
"we need to talk,i want to despise other people"
blah blah blah /rant
woah now no need to cuss
hush it you
except for the updates
since i essentially finished it today lol
honestly, the only game that i’m looking forward to out of what microsoft showed was fallout 76. but i’m just waiting for bethesda to give more information on it
whats the difference between gum and marshmello?
aqua
okay bethesda legends isn't the same as tes6
i feel like theyre gonna pull something
that's a dragon priest
like last year’s nintendo e3 presentation when pokemon for the switch was announced
bethesda isn't dumb, they know announcing something like 76 so close to 4 with no tes would stir some shit
because porting skyrim to the pip boy was just too hard
i died when he said "iiz slen nus" and ice fell out of the freezer
also, i got the kh1 platinum trophy the other day
in other words, i'll buy it when it's cheap and hackers figure out how to hand out money
i don’t see you declaring war on countries for no reason and looting cities
animal man is gummy’s son? <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
the fuck you mean 3 am?
didnt reply to me in modlog either...
drago
misc. stuff
hello there
we’re a small group
and yet i still dont get any of the stuff i should be doing done
so i have a bunch of tears that when i fire them stay in place until i release fire, and then shoot off as vortexes of death lasers and hell magma that explode
its a very fun game
not my fault apparently the pope hates me so i’ll just take napoleon to rome and loot it
honestly it mightve been in utah. ive been to utahs capital and one other town north of that i cant remember the name of
master you officially have too much time on your hands
beef?
well i mean you dont have a youtube chanel
and really shitty
you can play wow by yourself too
for the people that could survive in guantanamo bay
i'm from the days when online gaming was in its infancy
ah. meant to type that into a different server. sorry.
rc you suck
but i need my analytics
guys
eating raw cookie dough is worth the salmonella
i just love this movie
or youll be alive, if you call that living
gummy, i'm serious
gummy, i will beat any toxic narcissism out of you so help me god
want to do it to him?
sleep now or something bye
on switch
happy birthday, bella.
now time to plan out something really stupid that im going to do
kumatora and boney in lucas' final smash
you travel to sovengarde to kill alduin and eat cheese
the stream chat is going nuts right now.
not in that order
to the trailer pref
but still i'm hyped!
fyck yeah
i'm not crying
smash is fun but i can only play kirby
i'm not saying the old ones don't matter. i'm saying i've seen what they offered and now i'm more interested in what's new
i'm a daisy main for life
and i'm going to stick with mario kart. and maybe mario party when it comes out
or try to hit from far away
i was kinda hoping for netflix and youtube apps to be announced
you'd think it would be that easy but apparently this little to-do has been raging for like a half hour now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
im confused
also i'm pretty sure pokémon is the reason why they're waiting till december to release smash
did nintendo actually say anything about pokémon? because twitter is strangely devoid of pokémon
also did i say 47? i meant 147, i missed a digit
no part
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
math126 (pre-calculus i) midterm
honestly it's probably not work reading too much into it
i get that its an engineering course so it has to use the imperial system but i dont think the imperial system ever gave grades on a scale of 0-9
i don't think it was bad.
cake or ice cream?
of course ive only seen like 4
one thing i hate: es6 overshadowing the rest of the conference
yes why
its been free
yeah i mean no need to bash their fun
it just was pointless at the same time
i already played a bit of that
i can understand why people might see it as more of a port than a brand new game
i know but being excited for a game they like and not being excited for a game they dont like doesnt really make them hypocrites
i still have my wii u as a paperweight
also i didnt play videogames in 2010 or whenever it came out
what about double dash?
ct is the only major jrpg i've played through
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
for not being faithful to the original
my brother in law got me chrono trigger
nope
86 years old
so, not only did nintendo have their splatoon and smash bros tournaments today, but apparently fortnite has something going on. ~~we can clearly tell what everyone would want~~ <:kappa:374346980136058893>
the guy who you don’t want to mention?
e3 was fuckin boring
good job 🎉
and this was just from me reading a fan site; i never heard him say anything from himself
this guy gets it
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
speaking of which 18 in one week
tomorrow will be worse
i’m pretty sure there won’t be as much story and stuff in it
what do you expect me to do with a bowling ball
he probably feels ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

nice
what does our agreement actually do?

the portuguese man they killed 1:6 of my army
i just remembered: i have a saxophone in a closet and i haven’t played it since 5th grade

i wish the characters in the train had more to say

i'm just more active so i can attain red galoer and be haopy

both are kinda bitchy at times and apparently i have that trait as well
welp didn’t win anything from the scratch ome
it uses location so it would for you
i would say try it...but it doesn’t seem to fit you unless you are willing to go through a whole season
at my place of work, you will see people spend so much money on those and usually not make that amount back
hey gummy remember the time you found a way around the at-everyone ban?
that wasnt really him finding it as much as not following my directions, the much easier way to do it is through the other thing i showed you drago
don't be an undesirable person
am i undesirable?
rounding is hard
guess i better take benny out again
i think he was the head of admin of the forums actually
i had a good bday though besides not winning anything on my scratch ticket
hello there
just gotta figure out drago’s bday and troll him im twitter that day
i didn't do anything
twitter
its fine as long as you keep your socks on
you could have done something like this
but it’s good
ah good luck bear
neither can i
i never took the ap exam in the one ap class i took; i just paid for the credits
very bad
i sold my console for pc parts
hmmm
you terrify them
i'm a bunny rabbi
hey! i didn't get to that part yet!

you know im not going to let you compliment new jersey to that degree
practically canada
your state sucks drago
florida is good in the sense that "it's not new jersey"
oh so you went to the not populated places
or whatever the fuckin quote is
why flubs?
lets go to canada flubs
that's what they all say
free money
sleep now bye
all i had to do was show up to school
i just don’t like the large jump in levels
wait
any cooked pasta is good
(－‸ლ)
games tab in friends thing
random stuff
cant be bothered
so if the sun were to explode that would be a literal disaster
i hate friendship
its just math slang
like honestly there are better ones than ours
and thats on the complex plane?
why not just play the one thats on windows 7
what would the baby look like though
the seasons are crazy there
then its not a virus now
i knew flubs was addicted to cocaine
well misty tells me i have a gambling problem
13 reasons is awful
i want dramatic music
i had enough teenage drama irl, why do i need more of it on television
okay what about west virginia
maybe should have gotten yelled at but whatever

i was barely able to pay attention to yesterdays stream my schedule has been not so flexible
i play the spreadsheets

its ok, you still have time to ascend to pcmr
fuck yeah
i will also never be a pc gamer
level 1!!!
hey, i love the current meta
never use it
relatively lower on fun scale
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i wasted about an hour of my life on league and gave up on it
booleanreduction counterargument: no
it has crashed my rune pages at least 5 times now
and when you mentioned floats on pc ratings, we just use mod sets for that
e!kill master
why am i the only one who gets hurt?
i do wonder how many of those were me leaving gms running over night, to be fair
hey master remember an age long ago where we wanted to _discourage_ violent roleplay? :')
oh yeah and minecraft is <:treason:396483914803445761>

it's not like it's cold all year long xd
im on the floor, gummy is now pissy, red is failing, and there are too many fuckin canadians
this ones ok
i'm inside flubs' head
i was surprisingly popular in high school
which is funny because i hated people then also
also imma focus on getting up so no talk for flubs
we have a ™ button
no wolve
want me to re-route it to algetty?
it has been requested that we route this conversation over to <#311411150611021824>
and by that dragonite means we've had that pokémon gen wars talk like 20+ times already and people are sick of it
gummy will give you the tour
there can be two moms, jesus christ it's 2018

i bought it to give the creator money
the old man from pawn stars has died
signed in on a school computer now, let's see how long i can do this before the teacher notices
this is why chuggaaconroy is one of the few youtube gamers i can watch nowadays : (
is there a final exam for speech?
rollercoaster tycoon 2
idk but ive had interesting luck with that so far in this school
yeah he was like one of the only authors i read wililngly since harry potter ended
hmmm
my mind just cant understand doing two things at once
legs are good for things even if you cant use them
it's about as complicated of a definition as the average program that dragonite writes
sorry gummy is just rubbing off on me
everything
you are supposed to wear heels flubs
why must it be really active when i’m busy?
flubs is your dog superman
*throws math out the window* i don’t need this right now
man there was nothing like wii baseball
thats where youre wrong
nicholas the second was a dumb ass
we want mario 64
my scripting language is hereby known as "orange"
they're good
powdered mini donuts are so good, let me tell you
oh boi, sneaky back at it again with another cosplay
oh, and stephen is going to meet mal in canada for something
oh boy
well i've got some years to go
she is awesome
much curlier, and benny has brown on his ears
hai majestic
yet you do it and make it look easy
im just hoping my group members got 100% too
assassins are a dime a dozen, i'd just do it myself
now i can have time to watch batman with the asshat
i would hire an assassin
cant record replays tho
i just found out we’re on the 15th anniversary of the room coming out
im the dumbest person i know flubs
im at the part where we know shes gonna get dead but she probably isnt gonna get dead because plot
because time paradox
same
and future
who were the contenders
but only because
my report cards don't do that i think, mine would register as a 101 or whatever
or barry as a character, idk which. either way hes a dick
who’s sara?
aight cool so explain how season 3 ends
im like halfway thru s1
and guns
nah, kara and sara are both my two least favorites
and nothing but
couldn't get into it, don't know why
i'm not getting ice cream but just let me say that i usually just get vanilla
super common near me
have yet to go to the ben and jerrys place near me in a while tho
i figured out why she didnt eat this one
wait flubs did you say ben and jerry's in town?
i said pasta
flubs was talking about a show
anything is better
yeah because they suck
almost one year anniversary of something every big
the day we decided to flip off some dude over the big water
i guess you have been though. bad gummy.
i dont have a source on that though
july 12 is when i first met you and bunni
but like why do they need to do it that way
you join the skype chat around july 18-19 of 2016
oh, i don’t see jello that often
hiya
and those sandtraps always get in my way
if you feel like traveling halfway across the country or something
just finished high school
i dont play it nearly as much as i used to but it's probably still my favorite franchise overall
actually my road trip might not be that bad because i get to see my pokémon-playing cousin . . .
i resent that statement
july 12th will be one year of me meeting flubs and bunni
i'll give you 10% of my check
you already have all you want from previous events as well
oh yeah thats true bella. we can just get him fired and still get paid.
do we though?
but that's just a part of life
solving in general is my cup of tea
you wouldnt have to dread going to work there ever again
hey man just because you cant get hired doesnt mean you cant make money
he’s 8 pounds
i lose and lose
brb starting a pyramid scheme
the exam looks like fun
i insulted drago!!!
actually it's personal so i can't talk about it
awesome
hee hee, gummy said "butt"
divert 1% of bird game to d.js
now that i think about it i can probably extend the hello there interactions a bit more
i wonder how many of those are in there
if you can't run a 1996 video game you have some issues—oh you mean the new one
that butter replacement is better squid
_looks at bella_
it’s rotten because of stupid events that happened
```i like all boobs! all boobs are good boobs```
```_pokes ida with a stick_```
how many people care?
vista
it just amazes me what people come up with
speedruns especially interest me
fire is ida’s thing
the french wanted the brits to shoot first
that seems more like letting your rival pick a pokemon first
whoops
napoleon is why all the european flags look the save
correct
nah spain was what was the early reason
the french were cowards after napoleon’s empire collapsed
it is, and i'm winning
yes he missed
so we are basically brits
then the english did
of course
my family is from france
im sharing memes with friends
i am the senate
i apologize for my rant there, i just thought i should express myself
good
foooooooooooooooood
now it's a civil war
i know that wasn't the point of this, but i think it's fair to point that out
manman sounds like a good superhero
give me a sample one
but if hes animal and man but man is animal is he animalanimal or manman
drago you are in charge of it now
idk, try poking him or something
shut up i like my version more
oh i see
such is the way of htings
no worse
who said i was making steaks?
and yes
also youre not cooking youll make the steaks horribly
im not eating that
i just bought 4000 pieces of puzzle so cats aren't allowed in my room till that's all solved
also my video editing job got delay
yeah *replaces airbag with potato bomb*
i eat like a soldier
good job
wanna hang tonight?
thought you had it on the floor
4000 pieces just means it'll last longer
....
fair enough
<:keepo:327304799919800321>
do you not know what a stoner means?
my bacon for baconators...
they might've changed a few things since than.
i remember something else i used to eat was a vegan product, but they changed some ingredients and well it ain't anymore
nyet
whats the old folks home
do not sleep at me
half of conversations are fun
i like music
drago gummy called you crazy
and its almost been a year since the best day of your life
well camelot 2,0
3+ hours in now
horrible server name
if i make myself to apparent i will get mugged
or a glock
but it really isnt that bad
i know but i can minimize my chances
traditional news outlets think anything that’s animated is for children 😒
no no kill the old people. old people hold jobs and say mean things so just remove them from the equation
chautauqua
and blamed it for making a kid commit suicide
is fortnite turning our children into satan loving cannibals? more at eight
a gummy's afternoon
i mean itll happen to all video games that get popular eventually, it's just a matter of when
why did the game grumps recreate a meme format
the 12
but he hugged me
i had just a minor defensive reaction to it
you know what
even when you don’t like someone you shouldn’t say it out loud
we know
but i needed to teach a friendship lesson today
<:ironic:307345212328509442>
interesting
do as i say not as i do
welp
but you wouldn't last
something something wookies
of course
boom
send me in
well i assume some of the ones i talked to are there
still didnt answer my question
wait
nice
did alienware glue those in or some shit?
master
the case i have rn i got for free from brad
there is still a new motherboard and power supply
ram is good for me as well
upgrade
why are some of the sabers different
animal man you should really get that autocorrect checked out
just go on newegg and look at cheap ones
unless master wants them here
that wont cost you more than a mortgage
im going to end up blowing something up
ddr3 pc3-12800 non-ecc (1600 mhz)
oh wait
not really
thats 3 not 2
i just saw that
notice the giant 2 gb in the top left corner of the box
did something go?
case upgrade which requires new power supply and a new motherboard
two front usbs won’t work since there isn’t enough power ever since the hard drive upgrade
i'll make a partitioned by --- version of the doc
the thing with e!commands is that nobody uses them after the first few.days
should keep me entertained for fifteen minutes
so other than that, how's everyone doingm
except for like the crash one (me)
if it says am3 or am3+ it wont work with intel
anyway im going to be in an automobile for three more hours. master know any good shanties?
all i want is a new case, power supply, and motherboard
my sanity
cpu model?
why do you guys carry laptops with you for class?
except for the time i recorded b roll for something while waiting for the professor
you want side window?
for when the time comes
my major is video production
dont burn the server down while im gone
what formular?
yeah i need to know this too
and what i got seemed like a devil spawn
now, back to fallout
what the fuck
good to know
mmkay
i even check the max rotation and it was set to 360
youre in degrees or rads?
winter is that but with more white
mom wasn’t supposed to go with dad and sister to the city but i guess they did
spring and fall have allergies though
zoom 6?
i wonder if they actually expect anyone to watch it
is it valuable stuff?
spring and fall have allergies though
then eat
but i had no clue it was called super tower
kyogre normally learns ice beam, yes
can kyogre learn splash
well this is the other super tower on this site
and you were right
no just 55 million and what i would buy
wait, what?
thanks, i mean i think i can reach it since video premieres count as streaming
ok, time for sleep
now you’re in the dirt
good job
apparently some famous guy took offense at corphish and handed his ass to him
was telling the pony server yesterday about me getting ban on youtube
holy fuck
you plug it into the headphone jac
seriously
hey guys want to know the dumbest thing i ever did?
now gummy
la familia went to italy a few years ago
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
of course you have to be sarcastic...
does he actually have the following to warrant fighting back?
it's a book
and now i believe someone’s dog is barking at them
fireworks are ez even though i've never tried them
. . . there is no possible interpretation of this where it doesn't sound awful
didn’t see that much yesterday
that gummy is crazy?
i meant the former best friends list
that or you become unofficial blood siblings
as opposed to the usual 99%?
ヽ(°▽ °)ノ
drago sounds like a robot
no gummy
blitz as on of those amazing deep voices
then again for some odd reason i went from hating rc to actually liking him
i love how drago was like
why would i switch spots with you? and what are we switching spots with?
it was enterntaining
how come i still do?
the old sg one that didnt make me stay in compact mode?
what is life's greatest illusion
but sister is probably going to want to play fallout and that requires the same screen and i'm too lazy to commandeer another television
im single as well
whats the most savage way you can destroy their entire faith in their faith?
unfortunately i'm a single loser
or how long was the day before god made the sun
yay single buddies
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and majoram
i’m quadruple
of teeny tiny pizza
oh please i've done and said worse, now i wanna hear it
now that youre full start bombrding them with questions about inconsistencies in the bible
all this talk about strangling and pain makes me extra sad i have no gf, rip
she wouldn’t hurt me
oh i called one of the mods in a server "favourite little mod"
im done fooling around, if master wants the bot's game to be something useful i'll let it be something useful
god shit on the kaiser!
you aren't even on the list
also marksmen aren't bot laners anymore
there's no max level anymore
(◡‿◡✿)
got th modding yet?
can't believe wob found a loop hole through rule 8
lmfao when lee sin doesn't get a single kill or assist until 20 minutes into the game
i am the most crazy
skyrim 620+
<:treason:396483914803445761>
very fun so far
im actually psychopath level according to both online and irl people who know me well
basically people getting caught stealing at a gas station
no chicken
err no thanks
i wanna get the duck blown up by the ship
that's actually the name of a youtube channel.
luckyskarm
“some people live a simple life, while others have a fire that threatens to engulf the world”
ooo another pokemon argument
*throws the sentence out the window* i suggest you start over
i mean im doing it im third person
i want the roleplay
“i do not know when the fire in gummy first burn, perhaps he always had a destiny...”
i guess i really hate you
enemies (drago) and peoplei despised (drago)
and guess what you aren’t in it!
teaching the bot to sing is the best thing i ever did
the pokemon tournament
even though they weren't even in that server to begin with
i meant acorn gun
i got a sword
why is the rum always gone
imma break something
xenobald
i want rum right now as well
now if bella ended with a "o" i'd say it sounds pretty similar to "jello" but that's all ive got
whatever you say fantom
right gummy
gummy can i write your biography
perhaps he always had a destiny, but sometimes destiny can use a little help..or even an argument"
panda and squid sound similar...
time seem to stop
but i need something more powerful
thats what i have so fay
what i should be doing: taking the dog for a walk
the irony of that.
i am angry
｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
how have you not gone insane yet?
gummy the south pole is not the equator
penguins
ah fuck i put explosives in there too get down
:ya da:
there
goddamn emote isn’t working
for some reason, “ta” kept getting autocorrected to “ya”
why?
would have taken me days at home
reroll that dream
i dreamt i got promoted to mod on pony server for one week but i had to change my name from supergummying, rarity gif expert to supergummying, wailord master
you rang
wait
im supposed to be a wailord master
i hate skitty
he promise to be home like thursday
im going to get a sylveon gif maybe
is that <:treason:396483914803445761> i see
subway
i was sleeping
im refering to the server theme nto the usual topic
im not sure if that's how it works
and looking at the randomness of your nickname history
there goes the perfect game
six perfect for tampa bay
dndgreentext
because i dont already have enough of those
you need more
fineee i;ll ask ida
he’s my new best friend
....
no that special tried taking my waifu away
who else do i fight?
she’s my sibling now
bunny would probably just chew on the cards
thats why i asked you about the writing to a file in java
okay rainy
big brother feature
whee
my face is this 😐
what smirk?
where is luckyskarm?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
well i could always drag ida in the roleplay
you always agree with me
it’s usually ida that drags me around
how are we boring?
you gotta say ridiculous things everyday to catch people’s attention
it’s fun <:keepo:327304799919800321>
its basically everywhere
and go on from there
wait what
hmm i guess i could take master's approach to the big brother bot and have a timer counting down rather than a timer counting up
why do you think i leave this place all the time?
helps a lot rainy
but i want to know how fallout ends
intel® core™ i9 7980xe (18-core, 24.75mb cache, up to 4.4ghz with intel® turbo boost max 3.0)
traps are so so gay
all lemonade is created equal. some are more equal than others.
well
editing an advertising video for him
case should come tomorrow or wednesday
let's not descend into that argument
my stuff came
like my new wailord pfp?
thats a horrible idea
i don’t wanna video edit
he is using fimora
actually now that i look closer at it
cause its unrealistic for some like dragonite or animal man where those might be used in a different context
im not complaining
okay the bot can mention people but i've trained it to not in most circumstances
but um
i was voting for him you know
don't look at me it's not my fault we're out of phoenix down
yeah
dead yes
drago's forum friends got the boot
has he grown up at all?
i told you, he's the mother of all mary sues
and there was one more?
we're all friends with a guy who has 270k but that doesn't make us popular now does it
ever since he collab and made friends with people
i imagine that went well
i think i know a place
that’s pretty much it
1327 for me
he better not be greek
dude rome stole like 90% of its shit from greece
do we call him dragobro?
i'd rather end up as mortal enemies
thats not the proper way to search
the serailzable shit?
so it is
i tried that too
oh hes offline
thats not full ap thats kayle
nice
i just got baned
'; /                          5555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555563 m                          50..7uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu858965555\\\\\\\\\\\/
so basically everyone who wanted to be banned wasnt and everyone who didnt want to be banned was
burn your phone
oh dear
2.5 mi
it's okay, life's a joke
so is renpy
30 mins later
i embrace the magic
hmmm
nobody does
never heard of him
you are no fun
he’s a great guy
sounds like a weird guy
so, i never fixed that bicycle tire because dad has the hand pump that i need to refill the inner tube. so i had to walk 2.5 mi home in the 95 degree heat in a black shirt because i'm smart and have lots of fore sight.
someone explain to my sister what a raspberry pi is
does this look like a healthy sleep schedule?
i'll fix it some other day. for now, code.
also still not going to be active here for god knows how long so thats fun or something
why's that?
/r/history
same
i'm only in one server that has a nsfw channel
complicated bullshit
what server?
is it my server demon lord?
where was i again?
well some servers allow both
idk it’s a reddit discord, reddit is weird
she's a princess who wants to be left alone or doted upon and loved intensely, no in-between
and gummy, have you considered gitting good?
i never talk there tho
you can guess which one this is
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
ask master
*takes cat and runs* i want a cat
i have my own bad counter this time around
a lot
i need to get in my pc again
have you injested enough of your namesake
is that true?
that’s what i am gonna do today
perfectly balanced
update: patch broke when i put the tire back on the wheel. fingers too sore to try a third time. skipping bike ride today.
i’ll take the motherboard risk
while others say i don’t
k both hard drives are good
reading patch notes is for losers
a guy posted his setup in a server and i saw for the first time an extended super tower
the chimchar was my starter in one playthrough of platinum. i think it was during my trip to disney world in 2010
that’s just a toaster
theres a lot of anime that i need to watch
now to move the processor over
i never read the rules
e!google server tower
well maybe you should have considered that before doing something that you knew was going to result in me seeing them on fire
they're good for your health
like this
pretty
i have a response to that but i have to find the timestamp
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
oh finnaly
youtube recommends dogs getting tased videos
yay for typing 3d modeling shortcuts into the discord chat window again
with dynamite in it
i’m back from work ya ninnies
what about those bean boozled ones?
ok, i feel tired. but if i try to go to sleep now, i’ll just toss and turn for over an hour. but, i don’t have anything else to do 😑
basically meaning he/others don't care whether or not people see what he's reading based on cover art.
the only thing that pops into my head is why
the grape one
the ending part is what bothers me most ~_~
be grateful.
how are you this night
gummy you _are_ a robot
i sure do
i said i thought it was wednesday in another server
flubs is like dead
dont be silly, i only do those when my brother is at school
so thats today's til
glad to hear it
dont nom
maybe some cables
guys let's just face it, eyan streams when he has time
thats not your pc
melt it down and sell it as a doggy chew toy
because why not
windows products
i mean technically you said it last tuesday, so....
master you are smart with online shopping
the royal navy is better than winter
other than that summer is brilliant
gummy im going to strangle you
isn't gimp available on linux
what am i going off on
gummy did you say "a terabyte" or "eight terabyte"
and push it to github like a normal person this time :<
that's something i never though i'd say until last year
hang on
for the record i don't know what half of these do
you know what? that's like the third time in as many days that i've posted osmething to the wrong server
whats your point?
what is the music of life?
good job
what is the gift of death?
i fell off the ether mine a good four or five times
this is fun
im an expert
third time being banished
in this windy old weather
stormy old weather
that’s embarrassing drago and you should feel bad
rainy here
well
thats why i am saying it out loud here
i'm pretty sure that's the default
he started one, but never finished.
it grows exponentialy
pretty much.
wow apparently the league community turned into a bunch of damn snowflakes, i can't say anything in chat anymore without getting banned
that's a rear wheel drive car on a dyno (a tool used to measure power output in a car)
asking for help or asking people to stop dying is apparently a bannable offense
every ten levels
see thing
its summer, who tf is giving you homework?
i am more insane than everyone here
same
well rainbow colour
a person just posted a pic of his pc and damn that liquid cooling looks amazing
i guess dragonite
well except skarm
i have the non rgb version of this mouse
scrub
and they did great though was hard through discord
but made with science
thats how everything breaks
well you better send pics
sadly
get rainy to talk to you
but 5 days
and why am i in charge of the vc? thats drago's job
i was thinking closer to 2%
except when eyan streams
i am retiring
does gummy carry a majority of voice calls here?
you just have something to always talk about
hmmm
i'm not sure why i was pinged
and they turn out like you
flubs is flubs but he can do my shit posting job
and i'm considering the same for you, just need your legal guardians to sign off on it
speak for yourself
it was just interesting to look back
its easy
that should speak for itself
though i don’t say much anymore
that isn’t pony base
lucky you
give me a dollar
i got attacked by a rabbit
dardoch is a bish
break time
and?
like 1% of my deaths were caused by falling off the world though
im actually really surprised
i just pm him 3 hours ago asking if he was dead or in jail
reboot first
whoa sneaky back on c9's stage team
(๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
then a bunch of them appeared
thinkingface
many things and i hate typing on my phone so ill explain whenever im not on my phone
i mean uh
i assume you were in jail
yeah
so im kinda like you now
dragonite
you are in france
don’t go to venice though
im very roman
bari
there are still living flubioids?
theres no way i havent mentioned that
417 days or 14 months or 1.14 years or about the average time it takes for someone to climb out of bronze
and needs you to be my wingman
really?
shouldn't it be gummy?
well tbh it explains why benny comes to my house everyday
good?
i’m back from work ya ninnies
                if (spl.length>=2)
var spl=message.split(" ");
we figured it out
anyway i looked at the code and it should be okay, since it checks `message.tolowercase().includes(refstring which is already lower case)`
you are good
we don't talk about that
hai friends ^w^
hello there
no bad
```js
i feel like this is the 5th time the fishing pole story has come up now
good job riot
i tried to but i can't get any msgs off my skype
so you would have to import them on your end
~~we’re all just crazy~~
fuck yeah
lol xd
(◕ ε ◕)
hey master i'm bored and it's too early to make food, tell me something to do with the bot
and even though you sniped me in saying that i'm gonna type it anyway
i vote option a.
you went from rarity to coco
i only cook bad food
good job benny (๑•͈ᴗ•͈)b
it was the potatoes' fault honestly
i was trixie last week
i hate mobile keyboards
update: my cooking at least smells remotely like food. that's usually a good sign right?
gummy, you really need to read a book on how to make good insults
same buddy
i said often you troll
you also like rarity <:kappa:374346980136058893>
i tell her that on a daily basis
i am
well, you’re no help
it hasn't kernel panicked yet anyway
/rage
r.i.p. grozard “swormswood” and eletux “elle-ectro”
noooo i just lost two pokémon in a nuzlocke
wiz khalifa's "see you again" passed it by about 7.5 million views
do `e!setref demon` or whatever you pref
this is so sad alexa play wonderwall
im having heat stroke again
then they travel around looking for that spell she needs
that translate to 
drago be a sheep next
imma learn latin
whats up squid hows life
alright, same
it's great
the one you gotta watch out for is gummy, aka rarity, or whatever he's calling himself right now
howdy fellow frands
for example
dumb and dumber 2
when was this?
nope i was gone
all set
hilarious
apprantly so.
but tbh it kinda makes sense
turns out no....
really?
no this is more like a basic tourney with friends
hello, hoe are you today?
rainy please
that sounds amazing, bella.
i was pretty young
they supported the snes for quite a long time actually
i come back for one moment and i'm greeted like this? shame on you.
~~git gud~~
it usually ends in a surrender or a treaty i think
i’ll take his apology as a surrender
classic front-loader.
that obviously hasnt stopped spongebob
i wake up to the ex apologizing to me
well drago the people in mlp are smart and know how to end something
i've never seen a single episode and even  i know who rainbow dash is.
im the dovahclean
that's where the toilet plungers are
welcome to the world of airplanes
whenever my dad runs out of storage space on his phone his solution is to say "put it on a flash drive" and then never do jack shit about it
gonna punch drago at magfest
how much do hotels cost
9000 was the peak
you can ask for a boo emote on your lvl 50
i thought it was a rabbit
or lewdness
but i hate anime
gonna get led out by security at magfest
in some places
and it only really gives you the bonus ad for the brief time frame when you're in combat.
because it will cost $2000
video games
over your dead body
never book a flight for next day
sounds like force
oh that reminds me
~~maybe i just felt like sharing them~~
im with c9 even though they did stupid things at the start of the spilt
maaaaaaaaaaaaaake gaaaaaaaaaaaaames
this time i will win
if so try warframe next
you make it sound like skyrim
yes, like the thing you're losing to a two-inch rodent
hell muskets dont even have a point
well shit
the whole relationship issue is saved
oh yeah blitzypoo
nice nice
play total war
i could make a fabulous girl
i won the wat
so i say war
im still single, and this is the first time in my life where i'm legit kinda sad about it so there's that
but i found someone even though she is the same one that tried to force me to be trans
so the chances of me screwing this up is high
i proposed to her yesterday but realize you were suppose to do that way later
i proposed to her yesterday
i've never traveled by plane and i hope to never really need to, or travel in general
wanna trade?
but theyre for flights to vegas and back
i know
im betraying my own book
do i seriously need to translate what i mean
<:kappa:374346980136058893>
also star wars is ending in 2019
it's not hard
it says the last movie will be 2019
wanna see what will happen to the darth vader mini dude
that is awesome
yeah
she just said the office
and took power for himself
he betrayed the ugly dude
i was inform by my mom
i think you’ll need more
because it sucks
i need to get back on a normal person sleep schedule for when school restarts, anyway
i almost redirected you to anime chat and then remembered that you were talking about mice
fuck
@ rainy
then i will borrow it
what about marsunbound?
that movie was made in the 70s the rabbit has probably been dead for decades
that’s a guy who needs a haircut
i prefer jupiter bound
alright
cheese?
bella!
it is not overkill
you told me benny eats everything
bella
thinkingface
you are my wingman
you can slap gummy with it
flubs does not have wings
well at least we know its an int
flubs only has left hands
and threaten to unleash 50 people on the ex
this was her ex bf
didnt you two break up?
people are gonna be idiots online
not her
i challenged him to a duel
i fight dirty
i haven't
i can answer that one for him
i know
there are many ways to check a problem
happen before
right?
whats your username
it took me twice as long as building the shape to add the letters
i did this same exact way i did another similar problem but im getting results that dont make sense
is it 40 feet horizontally or parallel to the slope?
come back
my calc was in bloody radian mode
it is
good thing drago isn’t a friend
nah not demeaning enough
697.0 then
guess who almost typed their brokerage account id and password into discord again
cats decided to make me play contortionist in bed for 2 hours
that sounds like a once-ever-five-year event
gotta love having a monopoly on mideival bitcoin
welcome
you rang
why is gummy a fridge?
i tried to scare them
yeah thats what i thought when it ran on hotel wifi
also it only has one u
it's why i didn't suggest krpg.
honestly, i want to see what a miniture devourer of gods would be like. <:lul:305559915714576385>
you hook the rods onto the enemy or boss and it deals damage every period of time as determined by the weapon.
as in pre 1.0.
i guess i should get used to that
i've gotten top of my team for the past 6 games, all of which were losses
like i said
i think they just dont care about the feature actually existing on a free version so they dont bother bug fixing for it
when did i do that
don't burn the place down
did you pet the cat
11:39 pm for gummy
so im traumatized since i took my friend to the movies and i let her text my gf for some girl talk
spoiler alert
alright
i sleep at 2
nvm you aren’t old enough to drink
probably wont be finished with my work and workout in like 3 hours but thanks haha
gummy this just cramming
0/10 connection skills discord
they will
messages not sending
last night was on the complex plane and demovire's theorems and today is about vectors and ellipses
~~in english?~~
basically z = r(cosθ + i sinθ) and v = ai + bj and *trying to remember general form of an ellipse*
ooh we talkin bout exams
did i hear history
btw side tangent i saw someone wrongly say "i believe in you" and said "i believe at you" and i refuse to say the correct way
well thats fine, you might bump into someone better
exactly
they could actually turn out to be someone you might not like so it’s a safer option
okay
what. is free on youtube. they're both on netflix
one reason i won’t be able to hold a relationship is most women will want kids at some point. and i hate children and i never want to take care of one. you can see where that will lead mr
i don't like work
well
unless you are like me and actually didn’t trust your gf
relationships are always hard if youre not 100% ready to be in a relationship, or not sure how to approach it
not all
until you realize you were being an idiot
stop being picky
what the fuck
alright heres an easy one
there was a 2017 gummy?
this isnt baseball
well ida in runs in he family
when you do it you just come off looking like a dick
i heard the mets lost 25-4 the other day
but it was trending on twitter
i ate it
i don't know
thats dlc
~~i think throwing him out the window would be better~~
i don’t even watch baseball at all <:keepo:327304799919800321>
hey gummy what's your mouse up to
maybe
listen to music?
im shoving off for the night don't etc. the place down bye
its not doing enough for me
what
ohhh ideepoo we still need to play civ one day
you’re dirty
also, my opinion on video editing is that, why learn video editing when you can put the time into learning something like photoshop
a simple version of photoshop for $100
gummy can't you have a pokémon picture or something normal like that
ahh yes, frame-by-frame editing
my favourite mod wanted us to be a trio
i have the 2018 version
do you think ida would be happy to know that i started getting into the fate(?) series? 🤔
whats new with you?
it's gonna be tough but i think i can handle it
drago why are you my mouse?
this was the girl i told you about that force her old bf to be transgender and me
that is um that is me
but who knows.
imma dinosaur
it's like drago 1500 and gummy 8
i know that i am aware of everything that i am aware to know about it
master go away
because both of us are fully aware our relationship wont last. we agree on just about nothing and our personalities dont match well
so you will never marry sarah?
imma slap ya
go to eyan's wedding
drago my heart is not for you
you aren't taking my throne
a long term relationship is emotionally and mentally taxing as hell
shes pretty much an objectively bad person but thats ok
im at the nicest ive ever been in my life
acceptance
i was suppose to love him
<:gwdogawoophotoblob:402874215759609867>
someone eli5 what the point of league is
remember
um you can't do anything though
idk what you are talking about
i can't picture serious gummy for some reason
i dont remember their names describe them
hmmm well i am tired master
bella dont encourage him
good idea
which will be ida
also i am breaking wedding traditions
and the guy has a best man
no you are negative in general with my decisions
what about me?
but a kid can dream
when you get back
never met him
what do you mean
ill tell you a quick one now
i like your great grandpa already
also hes like super bigoted
or something
kinda. we get along
can i borrow it?
oh dear
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
my dog is being lazy
<:lul:305559915714576385>
you do it
also so am i
since i am royal
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
ida!
wait, you edited the names in? lmao
alright guys since master doesn’t think im crazy and hyper anymore and that i “lost my touch” well prepare to listen to my new theme song
```java
ive slept 433.5 hours so far since june 6, played warframe for 180.5, and did spreadsheets for 31.5
also i just looked at my sleep schedule and in 4 days im gonna have to be at a mini physics course right in the middle of when i usualyl sleep
```
i hugged ida
flubs youll be dead before we extract gas let alone have permanent settlements on another plane
there are other planets
for once you dont take the stupid side
phones didnt exist back then
they did but they were affixed to the walls
traitor
something you did to me
thats like half of a train's interior for one section of the thing
let it happen
gummy, plug yourself in. you’re ruining the orange juice
senran kagura: peach beach splash isn't much better.
man i love super mario world
flubs arent you in italy time why are you awake
okay let the birds eat it
flubs go to bed
here is my theme
i’m still squid
needsmorejpg
hello rc, you’ll really like phantomrc
fiiiiiiiiiine
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
you moved on from super cases when you found out they were real
i still have yet to be pinned
<:thinkingsteps:396534879833292810> 
i feel like gummy rates games based on whether or not it has muskets in it...
all the one piece games suck
oh?
yes rc.
opposite of whitesleep
they even put that in sun and moon
skyrim is overrated
empires
yeah i was thinking of that one too lol
and then it kicked me out
that's the stupidest thing i've heard since... nevermind
“hi people, i’m superfridge”
i really want this pirate game
i am gonna clean it
i found chocolate chunks in my keyboard
3 in a half years ago
i found dust
thanks
and food crumbs in it
want some chocolate chunks?
im nervous about this podcast
shit now i want pizza
drago
thanks for sharing
ask negative gen 6 questions
so water won’t wotk
drago
i’m back from work ya ninnies
"water wont work because its *somewhat* water *resistant*"
or go
gummy it's too early in the morning for this nonsense
why would i be a home
and bad news
see my stomach is not my weakness
good news i get to meet her irl sooner than expected
i will destroy it
i got a new mission
and either way arguing is a sign of a healthy relationship, not an unhealthy one
well thats what we did
he also has a pretty extensive wikipedia page
im pretty sure he has a bio on there
that should be an option
lets see how long this lasts before mee6 flips it back
soon enough that collection's gonna have an integer overflow or something
that sounds fun
greetings, squid.
im shoving off bye
what in god's name is going on in here
flubs i don't like you
that doesnt fit in your pocket, and the average iphone user wont want one
but you just said they shouldnt
im trying to prove a video wrong
by smashing a keyboard
most peoples first phone is an iphone
theyve done pretty fuckin well
lower cost making + higher cost selling  = more profit
they deserve it though
hence why they are a good fuckin company
thanx
why not
then once this exam is done it's onto calculus and statistics
but its been a while since i've had a full load of courses to deal with so
flubs
ill start catching up to you in about a month
damn, that'll wake you up
like the first 3 weeks of school i never procrastinate i always get the work in like asap and then after that i slowly start to let it slip
brb then
lately i've noticed i dont really procrastinate assignments but i'll procrastinate everything else like my daily stretches for example
come on gummy
i don't think so
i have more duct tape than you have batteries
it hasn't broke yet
zeke von genbu, chaotic bringer of chaos
i'm calling the canadian equivalent of the fbi to put a giant magnet on your hard drive
or literally just mythra
blue screen is better
alright
stop errors are not better in this instance.
who said it didn't?
(╯°д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
oh shit, i forgot to inclue me_irl
i never knew that was a thing
holy shit you did
thanks
but at the same time no
they are better if you buy them from their website
isn't that just like
i transfer all the parts
if my relationship works out i will need to learn the british pound sterling
yea prety much
what?
if wages scaled like they did in the 50s
welp, i've corrected some incorrect intuition now so i'll retake the practice test in a bit to see how i do with the correct way to approach problems i first got incorrect
function factorial(x){
```js
   return (x>1)? x* factorial(x-1):1;
```
same until warframe
the human race deserves to die anyways
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
}
omg i am talking to a russian
god damn i am addicted now
league is good
the exam was way easier than i thought it was going to be, i'd rate the practice exam a 10/10 difficulty, i give the final a 5/10 it was really tame
~~tell me about it~~
just tape everything to your wall
dont think so
is league earthbound though?
plus im like pretty damn good at what the quizzes cover so it wouldnt be very good practice to just redo problems im already good at
alright now that you have that out of the way go play warframe
alduin plush
and i yell a lot
i could have install windows 2000
those last two lines are contradictory
yea squiddy ya silly goose you
do you have a mic stand?
blitz what is my wedding present?
i can't watch this anymore
shake me
but my brain explodes every time i try
youre the math nerd
flubs is a smart.
because if anything squid should be general reposti
so i take it magfest is a pretty big convention in terms of crowd size
lies and slander
im not going to pax
"i dont know"
imma tackle drago at magfest
splatcord
maybe it is
man i may love muskets
thanks
planes were sturdy
hi video games im flubs
sure at some point
im video games
oh god the intro
interesting
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
restarted my computer because it was being a butt
civ 6 and 5 are amazing
or solitare
apparently my aunt says it’s a big one
he doesnt play often though so i get it. im pretty sure he just walked into the encampment and lost
civilization is good
it’s different
it’s civ 6
man i love war
but when i teach you
whiskey?
it's like the blind leading the blind
instead of taking the bus
25 minute work on highway
in another country
laptop?
yes laptop
if you never hear from me again you can conclude i was axe murdered
i suck at getting ayatans
the anasa's sold for 10 each
how do you figure out their worth?
most people have it off of twitch but in a year or two if its not unvaulted it should have some value
any luck on finding more?
well drago
should have some time today to grind meso n6's
i swear this building purposely messes with signals
no getting axe murdered today
it’s not too old
no idea
sorry gummy
i have no idea what that is 🎉
also thing
<:seemsgood:327307864463114250>
hasnt he been close to evil from the beginning?
god damn it he's been infected also
thought so
thankfully rhino helps a lot
they go hand in hand usually
that class.. was stressful
rhino is great
i'm still wondering why warframe suddenly became so popular among certain people
but i could just as likely draw a best-fit line and say it's experiencing linear growth even though that would be completely ridiculous
no i meant something akin to this type of it
that's like
im gonna try weekly next
daily is a bit crazy
the relatively saine weekly version
no but that was the last thing we were talking about and i couldn't be bothered to remember what makes graphs that looks like that
nice
that sounds like a really efficient way to not get anything done
what cant count as a drug at that point
sliding up the bannisters or breaking all of your legs?
which is probably honestly worse for the floor at the bottom than your feet
i would say spreadsheets if that didn't count as a drug for some of us. *opens up 3 more in google drive*
technically he was my brother's friend so he was a lot older than me
see thats a requirement to get into ultra heaven
its pretty much a video thing
i had given up on it, but my brother started watching it so i would sometimes turn around and see it
and the newer episodes are actually more serious
can the non-affiliates still do highlights?
like, the entirety of the ultra space arc is really really good
hey hey hey i duplicated nothing
oh gosh darn it meesex
i am very upset
wish i did that a minute ago
tfw warframe doesnt specify how long your locked from accessing your account
my one complaint about it is that it doesnt specify the amount of time until i can again
too many password attempts
its just an oversight but yknow
feelsbad
there is a sub chat <:pogchamp:305560024443518986> lol
i didnt want you anyways
welcome <:hellothere:305560404715896832>
:pogg
you had to do that before?
why would you have to write an essay in math
and didnt know it had to be an essay until today
that's a line they can access
yeah that's how i found out
algebra is fun
i wanted to add another class
just helped a student with their budget spreadsheet. fun times
greetings, will.
sounds like dark magic to me
i actually used all the fancy shit on sheets recently
my top two ones are about what i do every half hour and what songs i'm listening to
though that one girl is cute
probably because he has to google "most boring way to articulate (x)" for every sentence
anivia vs zoe...
yeah i hated the book so im seeing if this is better
i read part of the book and i have to say
yeah
no downsides.
go for it
your favorite team is the chicago cubs!
i'm still deciding if my eyeballs want to read it though
ping
what's the link there for?
i have this.
i mean like
link.
omg drago looks lame
oh cool
draco you're not allowed to use the internet any more
i think
what is happening
you do enough work for both of us
its best is an idiot
whats the other jo then
debugging
e sharper pointy stick
~~well thats cause youre a mod~~
my gf plays zombie shooting games and stuff but says animal crossing is creepy
the override is useless
i complained about python on programmerhumor
success!!!! i have done it!!! i have no idea what i did but i did it.
play pokemon red and blue
that's like the same thing right
i’m back from work ya ninnies
us math nerds are a rare and special breed
i ~~stalked~~ had a look at all of my classmates' profiles and i'm the only one who uses github for things besides class
in 3
college is stupid
just twice for me
i stopped going in december
im not sure how many college credits i acquired over the summer now that i think about it
ah, gotcha
6 maybe?
nah go ahead
i have one
then make one
that sucks
if you have an interest in squid i'd suggest marine biology
guilty
and that was just to test a thing for eyan
master if you're feeling like self-harm i can put you in contact with some people
squid you have to get better at secretly making and spending money
hmmm
^ see?
no, i have a job and i only use my money. but, they like bitching at me when i spend money on stuff they think is a waste of time
it works for me but lemme check some stuff first to make sure it doesn't explode if someone else uses it
thats where the secret money comes in
you can just make files end in whatever you want now?
i like how javascript doesnt give a fuck and just plain texts it
if the new program was written properly it doesn't care what the file extension is, and just reads the header data in it to figure out how to parse it
i'll take that as a yea
whats that the code for?
they won 1 and 3
eww that sounds horrible
im actually gonna say 100 thieves
so aqua
same
oh look it's after one in the morning and all ive done in the last hour is google "whats the point of 4chan"
did google give you the answer you wanted to see
"do you really want these kinds of people on the _normal_ part of the internet?"
they were pretty much "don't post anything that breaks international law (((((but if you post it on /b/ we're probably not going to moderate it)))))"
which quest?
third or fourth or nineteenth time i'm going to try to sleep today, wish me luck i guess
got a neo r1 lol
i’ve been lazy and am probably on the last part of the new strange
yeah
i think i gotta restart my laptop or just log out
you mean like stuck in one place until knocked down?
super weird
drago
but that really is me
punching a hole in the window to escape is justified in situations like these
a little
but update: they saw me blatantly ignoring me, huffed a little, and stopped talking
i sent the thing to dragonite
100 thieves or tl?
. . . and then ren'py shows up
anyways, i’m trying ketchup flavored chips for the first time
with that i'm going to go do food things bye
it would be flubs
i like how everyone doesn't even comment on gummy's name anymore
we've just been so used to it to the point where it's just normal.
so for some reason i decided to look through my teacher's github thing to see what he'd been working on
enough of that
so one of my cs teachers created a github organization for class
god damn it
the second one
ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
and no drago
i thought about it
my sister was pousghpigb b[itto'ns on' myu k/eyboaro'd'; he'[lp
which one was the one where... ah shit i dont remember any
you said so
oh look it's after 11
i told myself i was going to work on bird game starting at 8
he does that in every episode
i was going to make a recursive screenshot of ms paint except paint is being stupid
i already wave a white flag
this is the original video
\:thinking\:
question answer
no cussing
whyyy
now now gummy
shed probably just scream
that's because your waifu is shit
(am i doing this right)
i checked his reddit profile a few hours ago, he got snapped also
so it is
you just called your cousin a thing
perfectly balanced. as all things should be
drago
ahhhhh
so will icbms
yes to sm
yay the light's on that means the battery didn't explode
ah fuck tomorrows monday
shit
my mom is ready
finally someone with some brain cells in this channel
the supergummying youtube channel will return
stream?
unless she's actually a competent person
you literally told me to get you banned
notsupergummying
i need a name
explosions are pretty creative
well i dont listen to you
yes, and axes are good at killing pokemon
i like when ted talk(s)
don't forget no wind
drago battle ida
lesson 1
which is sogno di volare
my theme when i battle drago
i'll beat you in civ and total war
flubs front and center
but intro music to that
why?
friends?
most of it was simply theorizing how long his dragon's penis was
wait
slee[
what about celsius
man i’m still wide awake
<:rooisee:430400878302855177>
isn't tomorrow labor day...?
i asked
oh they're league teams
tsm got knocked out by c9
man i need better weapons
last part of the new strange that ive been ignoring
rhino skin should make that easy tho?
it honestly doesn’t last long sometimes
a pro at zd
it ended up hitting my leg hard
i do!
oh god i glitched the plains
huh. now im just gone in general
game borders are fun
now im stuck
no you don't
lemme get back to you on that
since supergummying is a curse name on youtube
you just can't youtube
i also have
ida 514 gummy 0
drago 1563 gummy 0
discords been fucky for me lately. itll say i have a new message but not tell me the server or channel
sorry.
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
hmm?
she took you down to like 2 pokemon
wow flubs you should find a way to make that trick work with money in real life
yeah gummy about that
just listen to friday
i love muskets
why does benny have one?
the plot's thickness isolates
is it supposed to be raining?
its not raining, no
so water isn't supposed to evaporate or is it just rain that's unremoved?
as time goes on i'm starting to get more and more nervous for calc, lol
no it's a convenient life hack that god forgot to remove from the release build
so what have party peoples been up to
oh yeah ive been to _all_ the parties
that wasn't even a pun, that was just italicized for sarcasm
just have it use ints and -- like the old name call alerts
what can it be???
he's said it in like all of his videos involving legendary pokémon
that took longer than it should have because photoshop was being a butt
most of what i remember of early calc is basically revolving around the unit circle
thank you
i don’t remember anything from calculus senior year of high school
cal-bc was where things were different from what i remember being told
ha photoshop
i know what to do now
interesting
youtube actually recommended me something good
yes pimaster we over his
which is likely when im about 25 or 26
but you will most likely break up before then
maybe
and yeah what ida said
we will see
why is gummy benny?
oh sorry to hear that
>implying family gets even
they aren't
no she only has 514 points to your zero
lies
don't?
there is no formatting
im just a wreck now
thats why im ignoring him ida
i know
i know you had andrew cuomo who seemed okay but that was like six election cycles ago and i havent really kept up
i mean what?
that emote makes no sense a honker is a large fish
gummy you know how if you try and squeeze two protons together really tightly without any neutrons they'll fly apart with ridiculous force?
only
ida actually has finger
fine
are you sure?
oh well i am planning on getting you one thing when i get a job
drunk scottish accent... sure
why shave your head tho?
eh, it might sound like that
no, i'm icelandic
tbh mostly it's because i'm not good at vocalizing so everything sounds weird when i say it
that your icelandic accent is like a drunk scottish accent
i never swear
you did not have that name before all of the fucks
either way wossman also said it
i don't drink coffee
yeah, let's go with that
i kicked the addiction
don't do drugs
<:mhxsleepy:362261093998919680>
it's 2 am
that is dr wossname
hey'
rc and i are twins
i think i kind of just want a change of scenery after living in the same area for 17.75 years at this point
way different from a town with 800 people
ive never actually seen that, is that a thing that they do?
i remember people used to like him but now they might not
sandwiches are awesome
im in
wow im actually understanding proofs, kugal did a thing!
is she cute?
greetings, ida.
help
i need you to come up with an obscure way to calculate the number "twelve"
wasp nests are scary
dont think it works that way
you are currently general of the army
though most people do thankfully
true that
what does it mean to not feel tired
i feel like the air is made of fire
i have to feel like i want to read it myself
i'm like 45% sure it is
i'm streaming gummy, you should throw bits at me instead
it does, just gotta capitalize
shes not wrong
does @eyan not ping anymore?
they pay better
how do you pronounce it?
something akin to e!google but im getting lazier
you make a few good trades and you can probably avoid the grind
i need a new gummy
<:gwworkshopakashrug:398886014711496714> maybe you're a shower singer who wants to spread his wings a bit
at least it works
gonna need some axi's for that to work first
when websites go down i get sad
its not the most noble strat but its one that works
tomorrow university
gummy scared
hoboism
you could pass for me
gummy wanna go to creative writing for me?
dragonite give me your creative writing class
i think i fell asleep before midnight
my brain hasn't booted up yet but i'm guessing i'm going to be in class when that goes off
...
lost on first day
i kinda wanna add a third blanket to my bed
sick
you might be on to something
gldd
god damn it
in other cool news
ooooh nice
sounds like you understand your job, you just dont understand stupid people
no college for me on thursdays 👀
teacher: who knows javascript?
oh wait todays the fifth
in lastvillage
dragonite: [is only one who raises hand]
dragonite: im not sure if that's the word i'd use
teacher wouldn't even notice
i was going to express my condolences and then remembered that there are some dumbasses who take ap english
quantum mechanically
so we by extension are neverlucky
sounds pretty normal
that thing being more relic grinding?
how dare they
brad and i are in ap physics
no the thing is buying another textbook sadly
doesn't matter
about?
how many people are in your class?
university isnt high school
gummy you arent in high school now
the community calls relics cabbages
i also, hope you realise i had a bunch of circumstances that allowed for me to leave regardless
well i wouldn't leave either way since this class is hard
<:roosip:399827510776299520>
so heres some coffee ☕ <:gwowoblobcoffee:358278223018196999>
i get up at 5:30 now 😄
alright now the stage is set
i got 100% on my first stat test so that makes me happy happy happy
huh.
probably for masters other ~~random~~ star wars emotes
physics is fun tho
so probably 2.5 math classes
i love this university now
my parents have to get up at 5 am everyday
and?
im a night owl
my classes start at 10 am everyday, sometimes 12 pm, but i must get up at 7 am to complete my assignments for the day by a reasonable hour
actually probably a better idea but fuck no
for me seems like history will probably be the easiest one
press f for kugal
also keep in mind i also got dem house chores to take care of
i liked how, in my statistics class, we could bring a notecard with as many formulas/examples as we could put on it for the final. mine was full, front and back 😛
also he allows students to collect data together on laboratory assignments
my pre-calc-2 professor allowed us to have a 1 sided piece of paper for any formulas we could fit, and as much scratch paper as we wanted
fuck no
im saving up for sudden school fees
make your own fork of jslint that doesn't judge you.
greetings, bella.
delicate is playing
nice
and drago no
can i visit>
hai so delicate
often times i skip breakfast lol
well then no wonder you react when i say crazy things
so what different topics can we divert to that are not bomb-related, kugal?
like 20 minutes over due
~~i thought that was life~~
before 0
im gonna get phat
based on what my calculus book has told me
thats the answer im going with
for x/x
well the pi/epsilons leave you with with a huge positive and a huge negative which surely wont mean the same thing except for multiples of 180
mathway probably doesnt use a high enough x for its 10^-x
just gotta get another rare rock as an offering first
it says as x→0 for x/x the limit is 1
im gonna look at my next calc lesson
reminds me i need to do my lab manual.
nice
im already somewhat familiar with differentiation
why does 100%ing a game have to take so long
it's about 45 cm away from my head when i fall asleep
speaking of that guy
sounds like a swell time
big rip
i'm over halfway through the day
okay
*breaks whoever thought that waking up at 6:30 was a good idea*
but i have stuff to do anyway. feelsbad
break time
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
through the year?
pham
have fun dodging bow
watch me
you have no friction
as soon as something went into motion it wouldn't stop
what
im in physics class right now
next lesson is on limits at infinity
i can see what all of the other students in my highschool are taking as college courses through the dual credit program
and when you divide anything by zero you get infinity
from what i've heard and observed
because we can't comprehend it.
maybe that was the universe also
i'm not talking about the observable universe. all i'd say is that if the rest of the universe is not observable, why would we come to the conclusion that it's infinite?
excuse you public static main doesn't compile
when the fallout is distributed evenly, the explosion happened everywhere, never showing signs of ending, thus making us think it's infinite
keep learning
i unsubscribed from pbs space time like two years ago because all of their videos were pretty much the same thing
the big bang
so we can't definitively say it's infinite
unconvinced of what, im confused lol
i think he prefers the word omnipresent
see block texg
the big bang was five >:(
and then you have logarithmic intervals as the video professes
i never saw that video but i kept seeing it in my recomendations
i like to think of it more as the boom happened everywhere instead of one spot
maybe the sky thinks you need to drown or something
i've got history, then statistics work, then calculus
arguably yes and no
why do you have so much water?
im so hungry
why the hell was i testing live streams yesterday?
arguably
let me go to sleep now
huh. just finished reading eldest
and apparently the monado had a hidden monado and that hidden monado had a secret dickson that had a hidden monado. and now my head hurts
yeaaaah...  too bad that uh, didn't work out, lol
agreed, anyways, i got a game to play.  stop by my stream sometime, peace.
why not
there’s a subreddit thats just full of pets being wonderful and it’s my favorite one
im slowly moving my desk away from people
do subatomic particles and the void experience boredom?
but i’m sure this semester i will at some point. yay.
hello there
work in terms of what, kugal?
<:walkthroughwizard:372149588783529994>
i forgot my keyboard was broken _cri_ can someone at dragonite for me?
draco im going to make _your_ brain hurt
so i just had an email convo from my prof and he kinda gave me the impression that as soon as im done with math181 i just move onto math182 next semester
oh okay
mkay..maky..
thats confusin to me
so yeah
engineering math?
spazzer the great
holy moly
and how strong they emphasis that course
prereqs as they're called are decided on a course by course basis.
some courses last six months
aka you need to pass the prereq
thanks but no thanks, already enrolled in a university.
just as soon as you do a semester of math181 is bam math182
same ^
btw, i think i thought that courses are always year long courses taken in 2 semesters as my highschool courses are set up that way
i could recommend some books for pre-uni study
online courses yeesh
jeesh

im tempted to join but more tempted to see if it will work
i think that turns on motion blur
how are your 3 mushrooms
i don’t get how, last time i exported a 35 minute video, it took a little under 2 hours to export. today, it’s only going to take 50 minutes instead.

the first test i took and got 100% in my calculus course was just a pre-calculus review test
all good
well one semester and three months since for some reason you can't graduate in february
hello
she almost went through a breakup so that won’t help
no never
you never insult my honour
hello new person
i think with how much stupidity is going on at the very moment, that probably won't matter
but i brought wolf
he insulted my honour
hmmm
alright
oof mauling citizens is fun though.
hmmmm
(guys i think the new guy is a perfect replacement for me)
don't worry as long as we beat the enemy
(i am officially retiring)
friend
pat friend?
gummy is replaced
not within the kingdom at any rate
also make sure you give blitzypoo ding dongs
you lied
what happened
flubs took care of that
quick remove yourself from the server rankings
_dangles treat in front of spazzer's nose_
no you cant
jazz hands
what is reality in zeal?
i can now
silly gummy
i crossbreeded the explotatoes with corn and made none exploding ones
i would insult dragonite
<:doit:334014889137930240>
he did
solve p=np
haha p
"kulga"
hence the it doesnt equal one
the p isn't just replaced with a number
as x approaches 0 of 3+x, the value of 3+x will be 3
as x approaches 0
spazzer, i will say the most fun person to talk to about math out of everyone here is flubs
no clue
wait so what is he solving for there
doesn't work
258 in an 8 bit system
see ya gum
isnt that the one thing with triangles
depends
xini
yeah no
"258 in an 8bit system"?
i dotn followe
like
there is a solution
they have to
but technically in order to find the numbers we'd need to rack up a supercomputer for hours
yes and would those solve it?
it multiplies them to that exponent?
basically x^-n = 1/(x^n)
lets go
probably
oh thats rad
so positives make it bigger and negatives make it smaller
ok how do you multiply something half a time
yeah i know about the check thing but not the other crazy stuff
that wacky character is a radicand
or the existence sign?
compactness
why not use +
whats 0^0
it can but it will revive if people are still alive
yea pretty much
but you just said
so yep
ok so like what level is this math that im learning here
i always had a hunch
i used to be smart you know
says you
here's another one
yeah well it's neither
i have a question
well
it gives an area
cs majors almost as bad as physics majors
here's one frmo your lord and savior c++
isnt physics just like...observing though?
when would you ever use long division
me too
at midnight
yee?
yea i know
which could approach one
i dont wanna be the reason you fuck up your sleep schedule
an argument in 5th grade
jesus i don't want to go too deep into this
like geophysics for a magnetostatics course
in physics
or a senior actuarial analyst
physics teachers in general are fun
but i was rolling on a 43 with that prof so i dropped physics and focused on math
sit
we don't know
it varies so much from place to place i dont even know
65 for math
computers usually cant handle a lot of errors
welcome to canada
i wouldntve gotten out of high school if not for a 65 failing grade
and you *pay* for it to be harder
they own the hospitals?
government owned
nope
then how do they pay for all the expensive shit in them
like longer vacations
better credit
you can rent a house easier
sure. if youre a ceo you get millions, low taxes, and you can do whatever you want
free healthcare
thats so weird
so more corporations get involved
no here
jesus christ
its not mine anymore so if it goes to some rich dude or some poor dude doesnt really make a difference
they make a lot of money
every year
but your credit rate is in the 800s
yeah idk about politics besides the fact that i every time i get money the government eats some
berserker and drifting contact are from nightmare missions
now to roll it
you want mine?
do you have a spare or is that your only one
oh my god
back to volt i go
if you plan on using melee weapons at any capacity
yeah
deserves
aw that was short
youre asking me to change chairs, find the thing, come back, switch chairs again, and then talk hushed like so i dont wake sarah up

i didn't want pizza
so you went into some rando's house and they told you it was pizza and you believed them without doing any prior research of your own
leo mcgarry
and freedom fries
papa john's is bad
i think that's a confirmation
flubs doesn't know the brick?
so i win is what youre saying
absolute zero breaks physics
among other things the heisenberg uncertainty thing sorta stops working because you know the momentum (zero) and you know the position (unmoving)
so thank you
thats just when everything gets boring
once you hit absolute zero you can never regain energy
because quantum physics gets weirder the closer we get to -273'16
once the uncertainty principle fails
yeah exactly
yeah that many pa on individual *atoms*
probably need more than that for solid hydrogen
i like breaking physics
the entirety of quantum physics starts get loopy
so thats 2.4e-15 newtons per atom
assuming atoms are square which is wrong but its mostly the order anyway
just boil some water
apple products are gross

shoulder to shoulder generally
panda bella left behind the spiked baseball bat so you can use that instead if you need it
i give everyone full frontal
kinda how when a student tries to give a teacher a hug, but they deflect and only give you that weak side hug
you're really not understanding the hint
i'm just joking

drago
hello there
hi kugal boi
anyone feel like doing more b4 grinding
someone lost the sign
let's go with fractal, why not
is that a yes or a no?
excuse me?
imma look at my next calculus lesson
just dont do other things
next calculus rules goes over product and quotient rules in differentiation
holy moly it's a short lesson too
5 pages long, the average lesson is about 10 pages or sometimes even crazier like 15 pages
also known as: colds suck
agreed
it tastes like stale nothing
neato
you're a plant?
and what country has plants that talk
til kugal is outside the universe
youve never had anything
theres nothing wrong with setting someone on explosion
i hate freshman and all they are made of
i did that once
english is fun

i dont mind english
if you get understood who gives a fuck
and im still horrible
or _being_ a freshman
kugally is my faithful servant from this day forth
oh no, now he's ripping off animal\_man\_.
what
away faithful servant
which is the fancy way of saying it's fun to put two bad rpers in a box and see what happens
im surprised you found a way to open a box that had no door on it
yeah yeah
work takes away my motivation to do anything
if there was no uni i'd prolly reach kilwala in one day
did it have victory road music?
it’s actually really just an excuse to not be distracted by this place so i can spend more time in manechat
i technically sent someone somethign nsfw once
so what youre saying is you want lewd pictures of aqua?
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
that's all im gonna say on that matter
~~i can change that~~
if i was friends with only emotionally chaotic people
most of my pms is just chatting with friends however there's that one friend that just...y'know
most of my dms is me either shitposting, having a mental breakdown, or nsfw things
what is the half-life of one unit of ida
ida you’re stable enough
so i guess you can throw windows out of windows if you envision the object your throwing out as a window
gummy dont be lewd
and last night he was having a tough time
so i'm worried
im just worried that my family will disown me when they find out im dating a transgender
bot channel, please
so think what would happen to me
welp
i'm just complaining about you using an adjective as a noun, tbh
apparently online dating is bad and i will get shot
or mugged than shot
so it’s tough for her when her family calls her a guy
wait gummy i didnt know your family was related to my sixth grade math teacher
mugged then shot
eh i'll take it
will they shoot you through the screen?
so how is my replacement?
kinda
no it's just a big lava lamp
that was the last thing i needed for boltor
you had bad internet? you want to use this isp here to change your mind on that?
brb getting food be sure not to destroy the place until i get back because i want to witness the chaos first-hand
that's rich coming from the guy that keeps throwing junk out the window
you only blew up the food? that's unusually civilized of you
didnt i just put you in time-out for wasting food?
so it turns out that 4-oz cups of italian ice isnt very filling
i had a good response to that but i forgot it
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
no just the comic pages
wasnt rc also doing that
nyan cat is weird though

drago i’ll battle you once i finish streaming ultra sun and moon
we'll see what happens faster: my beard reaches the floor or you finish sm
what game can we play together
like mount and blade
actually that's an expression that goes around tech columns from time to time i want to actually look up how much computing power nasa _actually_ had in the 1960s
my dads place had that and it always died loudly and violently
because i think this quiz is either wrong or im just stupid
i know 3 ways to define it hahaha
(◡‿◡✿)
but can thanos convince dragonite's sister to take a cs class, is the real question
mind stone: yes
oh youre playing dodgeball or something
volleyball
it was like 8 kb of ram drago
except for the fact that literally none of my classmates were ever good at it ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
that's fun too
but i want a giant cupcake
my physics teacher roasted me today
oooh
also i think i have 20 neo limbo relics
i'm like
there was also pizza and i drank a bit too much lukewarm tea
oh i guess i did
screw the bills that live on the capital hills
now it'll be pretty
if this was fight club
i would've destroyed all of you
he's a marine
why is that surprising
do people not do that
i have fallen asleep with them on numerous times before tho
i wanna fight andi now
how so
to everyone on the east coast right now, please stay safe and be careful 🤗
welp
oh shit
the best part about that was when i got home
getting assigned an essay on the same day its due
to be processed
that damage is probably in the millions: i got some 300k crits
it's my home time that's poorly spent, either napping, watching youtube, or thinking to myself "i should stream stuff"
if you can pick me up then fuck it i'm down, but i doubt it
im already used to spazzed making no sense but i dont get what rainy is talkin gabout either
i've been able to pick up everyone i've evert met
enterntaining in general or if youre there rainy?
ahh blokes and their dick measuring contests, always annoying, but always entertaining
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
you considered streaming?
they do that well enough on their own thank you very much
yo cool
good job
boy oh boy
i dont know if i should be in awe of the internets stupidity or appalled
then i got anotha essay to writ
you get an essay and you get an essay and you get and essay and you-
he died from essay overdose
i just hope i installed my graphics card stuff correctly
have you tried warframe?

google is never wrong
and if you dont make it with tomato you havent made a chocolate pizza at all
apologise to google
have you eaten it?
the fifteenth commandment clearly says that `thou shall not put chocolate and tomato on the same pizza`
thirteen doesnt exist
that is absurd
shit not again
just like your trousers
where did they run off to this time
raise the air sirens the pants are on the loose
no cookie would ever combine chocolate with tomato
don't?
that doesnt make it a cookie
my job here is done
what is your job
your job is to beat yourself?
what is that?
but i like it flubs
hold on im turning dead robot zombie hearts into jedi focus points to let myself have better mana regen
its nice
since an apple hit his head
and he like discover gravity
like an eagle piloting a blimp
and maybe even that the neighbors discovered apple splat on their cars
no idea ive never played it
same
so who missed me today?
i did tbh
of course most of the high-chaos days were from last august when flubs first joined so it's a little weighted
to be honest you're not of magnitude to be a headache
where is jeff and the winter raid on that scale?
worst
uninstall it or turn off the phone if you have to
missed half the notes
there you are now issac newton
i was playing a hexadecimal arcade game and got a bit behind on cs notes about date time storage even though he was talking about dd,mm,yy and hh,mm,ss and i explained unix to him after the class was over
i can't understand
gummy thats redundant
master's grandma confirmed to be gummy's professor
well i was also on discord

i didnt know
flubs
hai gummy
i heard flubs
he sleeps from like 10ish until 6ish and then idk what he does when im gone but its probably just more sleeping
what happened?
is a service doggo?
that's rude
how does begging turn into yelling?
yes she accidentally crouched down to 12 inches off the ground to slap my dog across the face
you don't give like 100 chances
oh i thought it would have been more like bumping into him hard
meow
speaking of which
but why would you do that?
no cat noises
nooo
or rawr
do what i did yesterday
plot twist i didnt go to bed i stayed up and read comic anthologies for two hours
almost two?
you fool
yeet i ruined everything
there is a special place in hell bellow those yasuo mains for the people who thought microsoft was a good idea
just got back home
it's been a long time
at least apples costs are up front instead of $100 for os and sometimes it fucks up and also $100/year for basic stuff that comes preinstalled to be activated
i got all nostalgic when playing pokemon mystery dungeon when i remembered his old vids on those games. it's nice to see his community still active
also my parents are helping me open a bank account which is cool
i just email the lady my info and she does all her facy stuff and my parents do other fancy stuff boom bank account
something like that
but no one ever asked for my solution
here it is: p ≈ np
slap a dog that is
as many potatoes as is humanly possible
problem vs no problem
then you just roll that up in a layer of antimatter and bam you created a black hole
it's beautiful really
definitely
every day
so what you're saying is one day you might lose your main account randomly
thats the best name
nah its just drago 2.0
there are infinitely more solutions where p != np
e!skarm original joke
e!kill dragonlite

i agree with the dragon guy
it's larger than a gallon
says the guy who named himself after a black hole made out of energy
and i'm starting to say it myself and i don't really like it that much
agreed
now go get a gallom of ice cream\
i don't know, i think i like andromeda a little more
nerds
it's funny the 16th time
typically we discuss the bunches of reading we do. really depends on the authors. like we go on about their thoughts on matters important to the time.
we cover from like 1620- 1865 three different times
cs data structures: waste my time
cs digital media programming: do stupid things with chickens
sessino not found
theyre all hallow and selfish
i don’t like them either
that is most definitely a question for her
lord of the flies
i haaaaated reading lord of the flies
disturbing the peace
oooh
haha
oh dear bella
isnt harry potter just the bible but on even crazier drugs?
i read them all way back in elementary. good times
true story apparently
since we had to pick the book
seriously though, i absolutely hated doing book reports
well, more like 2
a different read but a good one nonetheless
how about literature
they’re more of an elementary/ middle school thing, blitz
i remember writing a paragraph-proof for a problem in geometry and it being like the most fun thing ever
if you ask kugal
geometry is kinda fine
good luck gum
kugal i have a question
honestly, with them naming parts of the body, would it have killed them to make the names for those regions not fucking convoluted and actually simple
i didnt have to read any book in sophomore, i had to read a book in first year
my first thought was the millenium pyramid or whatever it’s called
the poincare conjecture was probably my favorite unsolved problem to learn about
or were you thinking yu-gi-oh and you though of the pieces?
meh, nott hat smart lol
i dont think the level of math classes im in were determined on my smartness really
smartness isn't a word?
bite sells for a nice chunk of plat and forma is self explanatory
if we're being really technical
plus those anti toxins to boost the rather low odds
probably gonna die soon
one that has gotten bigger in the past 4 years or so
depending on what you mean on hole, sure
the table is that way. *points towards a hole in the ground*
that too
i like this green fellow
just a little death?
wait what
friday has ida
so anything with ida in it gets a beep or something?
here too
its free
its a 3 letter word, do you expect it to never come up in conversation?
sorry for the spam ida <:raritywink:427916498477121537>
squid you are an invention from phineas and ferb
hes a bac*onator* not inator
squid from hence forth you shall be the squidofbaconinator
i would pillage rome
allow me this as a late birthday present
go greeks
and i like ceasar
does that count?
i was just gonna move it up a bit but that works too
idk how to spell it
also known as the eastern roman empire master
it broke like, 4 times?
therse also a spike for me around 1300 bc to 1100 bc where trojan war happened
by then we had evolved past muskets which were fading out over that century in favor of actual good weapons
that and industrial age was end of colonial and final nail in the mideival coffin
oh shit yeah
wellp, tuba time
tbh i had some interest in romans, a little greek and egyptians
good job dragonite
i discover donations on twitch
turn my name back to green! pls
class took two hours to get interesting, why couldnt you barbarians have talked during that time period instead of after
you tell me dragonite how easy is it to eat one?
honestly who needs to remember these things when you can just draw a little picture when you actually have to
you should give him all your money
wouldnt that make it harder to digest
well she went to look for a female eevee with a nature she liked
or maybe it's the other way around
gummy you should stream your bitcoin mining software, then youll be melting your graphics card for no reason and nothing will become of it anyway
eevee you have a 5% chance to find
kugal why are you in an english class
the introductory cs course is 3 credits
then again i might not, i'd have to add up my credits and see if i can fit it in
i enjoy english
i imagine that's relatable
who knew saying nothing and just getting yelled at could be so draining
huh ok, sounds pretty neat
in practice theyre more like 103, 104 and maybe 106
i agree, good point
im not giving her the time of day
and?
well she called me
sarah yelled at me
not sure what i should be grateful for
do you mean outside my apartment or in general
ok so maybe it was one
she called me many bad words. also called me an "ungrateful bastard"
but then i realize i probably was being mean
what do i do
gummy help im out of beer
i doubt she has access to the means
it's strong
it was like $129
welp just found the craziest derivative of my life
well my cousin bought it back in 2014
that's a noni
headache inducing, maybe
exponential derivatives are that easy?
and the limit just equates to ln(b)
is that still a thing
last 10 mins of ap physics was throwing around paper airplanes
go play with your cat or something
well go get a cat
and pet
also i like this part of the chart
have you ever tried to teach a cat tricks?
might make things just a little more excitimg
i dont mind the names, they just give me something funny to talk about. but i personally wouldn't call others names
blitzypoo
i wish i could say the same
i thought all moms did this - no not really
whats the advantage of online classes
ive brought this on myself havent i
idapoo would also work but ideepoo sounds better
better than infinitely bad is still infinitely bad
plus i cant drive cos im a moron, lol
driving is easy
i like that
i mean given the traffic on the interstate thats probably a valid strategy
which enhances it for me
i hate it when that happens
i should do one of those
my college must not offer it then
other names it goes by sometimes sound like "formal logic" if that means anything to you
lemme double check something
the list just barely didnt fit on the screen, 255 is discrete math somehow and 256 is linear algebra
nope they dont offer math130 😦
ouch
i removed it since it's about as useful as the polish language section of the 3ds manual
appreciate it buddy
brb life probably
wow my stat test today is 5 questions
wait
100%on stat test woop woop

wait
also good job
hi will

not anymore. now theyre dead
hooray for books and food
good
i dont want to eat a rock covered in mud
you just answered your own question
there are too many darn fortnite videos
hmmm dingdongs..
you could switch fornite with almost any type of youtube video and that statement could still technicaly be true <:kappa:374346980136058893>
a what did a what and played what and where was i
that's a good amount
he has uploaded over 2000 isaac videos total
nice
drago you have to hear it to know it
my goodness
you know i said in the literal sense
squid dont encourage him
oh cool whens that coming out
also
there’s no 2nd “s”
i gotchu squid
it's either this one or the snes-genesis era
anyway, for warframe, i've heard rumors about that going on the switch, so i'm not too surprised with it going on the thing plus it's on every current gen console thus far
i know mario maker hasn’t
you'd have to design games for instances regarding the multiple modes the switch has, though
~~xenoblade x~~
> .txt.txt
master dare i ask _how_ it crashes
im actually rewiring slon to be 2% cleaner
plaaaaaaay something else
subscription?
so you have to play twenty dollars a year to play a game. why would you do that
still seems like a scam
nice
it’s not a new idea
but i still think they need their own loveroms/emuparadise type of system instead of what they got for the nes games
gta v is pretty expensive. now that one is pretty crazy
on the switch that is
they kinda have ongoing costs
so why not put your games on the money printer
and also steam prints money
nice
he didn’t like our money talk
if its on steam someone is gonna buy it. example: i bought 8 copies of robot rollerderpy disco dodgeball
me rn
whatever pisses you off the most
my ram has solace
the only thing about that service that i'm still unlikely to try out is nintendo's voice chat. i know they're oldschool with a lot of their decisions, but a mobile app for online voice chat makes little sense even for their standards
how do you think that is?
***did you mean:*** <#311402910820859914>
flubs
has she seen a vet yet
axi s3 and v7, specifically
fucking finally an s3
i should just learn to code in my sleep
you’re in the path of it?
just looked at it. it’s crazy how far and wide it hits the east coast
decisions, decisions
i should probably sleep
and the answer checker liked to do things like mark `x=5 m/s` wrong because it was looking for something like `x = 5 m/s`
to be clear i wasnt going to pass that class anyway but i could have failed it a little more gracefully
(it hasn't)
fuck it
so i have an english essay tomorrow
my highschool's math homework is great 99% of the time, mymathlab is great like 80% of the time, webassign is great 0% of the time
more or less <:gwovoraphixd:390538507799494658>
im already getting started on my essay
i have a thing due monday which probably means im going to get started after dinner on sunday
im doing a really good job of not procrastinating this year
except for yesterday when the janitorial staff kicked me out
i just spend my day off doing all of my homework
you dedicate one day to homework?
that doesnt sound *too* appealing to me, lol
i wanna die
(okay so a half hout later im _actually_ going to make an effort to kick myself off the computer bye)
t=+1 hour and still cant sleep, as per usual
where is dragonite and what did you do with him
hmmm
i need problems to invent stuff to solve for a class
give me problems
priorities are s3 and v7
that just means there are duplicates
technology has gone too far
can you react with both to this message
this is nothing.
heko
he wants us to collect data together and i just wanna do it solo halp

out of astronomy, time to finish this english essay
i live on the edge
got my alad done
thanks, i was kinda nervous for this one
i am talking to a guy that used to be in the military
hes helping me with my resume
im up for grinding now btw
or is that just a random one in my possession?
so how did you decide i would get that one?
dragonite i have a clear and easy plan to swallow you
me hungry
new pokemon looks amazing
eh, i'll do it tomorrow
greece
i should demand a refund on the grounds that the computer science department isn't excruciating enough
remember how i joked about doing my homework a half hour ago? i still havent started
the venari one
thanos whale
it has been many moons since i have had a steak
estimated time to takeover: 6-10 years
woke
i got a good insult
can someone give gummy a book on how to make good insults?
look at the picture
flubs do you rule the world?
it did stop the ones in wheelchairs
thats the time that matters
fair enough
learning games
nope
im pretty sure its legally impossible for a disabled person to hold a position of power. have you *seen* all the stairs the buildings in dc have?
so much frigging effort
is there a spider dog
he wouldnt take the thing with him
today i learned that dippin dots has its own cereal.. :
flubs
alright just venka gauntlet and scindo blade left
apparently so
it was cookies n cream flavoured
whatcha up to
with nothing to play it on because when i suggested i get the ps2 that was $10 more than it instead and i told her i only had one game she said to get another game
i still only have 8 gb
aqua relic grinding?
who's good with computers here btw?
because windows 7 is great and windows 8 and windows 10 aren't.
and again it won't stay in the middle of the screen when i drag it there, and reopen it
hmmm
nope
getting a new computer is not an option for me atm
i hated them.
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
i really need a better rhino set up 🤔
no effect
watch as it's amiibo festival deluxe
may i interest you in a squirt gun instead?
why is that even a question
drago wanna trade sisters?
oh the horror
i need a sister that fits under my category
if i ever make fun of your code style again just remind me that you have a twelve-year-old sister
your dog making cat noises
more like that microsoft charges $100 per year for their software
my gf making mudbray noises
this is what a mudbray sounds like
and put your ear next to his stomach
also t=+3.25 hours and still cant sleep
all the other days are just night, for there is no sun
my hearing used to pretty mediocre
my hearing is pretty bad
henlo
like how there’s a venom movie without spider-man
i had no reference so i thought they were good
spazzer you haven't lived until you've beaten games that are older than you are
flubs
emo spiderman.
maybe if you're still playing in like 1 - 2 hours from now i can certainly play
and also the first kirby game but that doesnt count since it's only like three levels
barely <:roothink:399827523581771796>
i swear to god axi s3 only starts appearing at night
demon lord stop being old
pink sounds like a curse
according to gummy im an octopus
sure so you just *happened* to shoot me through the smoke and a wall
"cane" -> [kayn]
panda stop
speaking of skyrim
youre turning into gummy
the sad part about me gambling is that this is actually more fun than the game itself...
alright
it's from that one berenstein bears book
\:thinking\:
here lies panda
<:gwnonaismug:373159826525519872>
he was a good panda
bonus fact: i would've done it anyways
which is very tiny but almost looks vaguely familiar
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
you shant be forgiven
curse you and your tiny faces
kugal wanna trade sisters
i too like panada's
hmm, bella's not muted that is quite the rare sight
gummy needs to learn how to promote himself <:gwossumikuyawn:395628757932834818>

i guess i'll just have to live with this minor annoyance
did someone say chickens
good job windows
i actually updated right after the update since it failed to install an update
flubs i love how worked up youre getting over this
flubs
pnada is cheater
update the update
demon lord why must you encourage gummy thus
hey master fun fact: you're at least 85% of the fact i don't believe in the pc master race
you should joint he party
bye pnada
if i wasn't so lazy i'd dig out the discord join/drop sound effects and then play them infinitely into my mic just to confuse you
flubs let's be honest
exactly
i remember drawing a snowy owl for a project back in third grade all you see is a giant bird with tiny stick like legs and feet lol xd
is four the only number with the same number of letters?
ida is still up 👁
why must the power go out right when i’m in the middle of playing online games 😑

i update it monthly
do you keep up with this or is it constantly updating?
no this is what a summer long spreadsheet should look like
over summer break i filled out about 78 sheets for a group and they were oh jesus what the flip is that

i have officially bandwagon from tsm to c9
i played as waluigi i think
tsm won
and it was one fight that cody fucked up
be at worlds
i don't even hate zven/mithy
to what degree of certainty do you say that
bothering mom about useless shit
or an array of booleans
and c9 getting the infinity gauntlet
i believe so
so no na week 2 curse
now i'm getting flashbacks to chessmaster 9000.
homework, coding, and chess
i mean
you _knew_ that already\
which is their week 1
remember, they have to go through play ins

im not sure what this question is asking of me
oooh
got 3/5 becuase of the screwed up questions
hey kugal
thats about what i expected
can you display that to three significant digits?
0.00002%
good job discord mobile
another point for online homework
100% on english essay <:kingof7champ:347617997705314314>
yeah but master if you work the night shift that implies you can sleep during the _day_
ask him if i can turn it in as my poetry assignment for my writing class
but unfortunately probably here to stay
hey kugal
burned half of my battery life on a sortie for 4k endo
sure
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
even though i woke up tired
two hours until class starts and i dont have anying to do and my phone's on 30%
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
i just need the username
see pins
the man
the one that tells me to stop
hmph
i was charging it and totally forgot about it
that’d be great
okay lucked out. person sitting by the charger station left
i just got a spare flow if anyone needs it
i didnt do any of that yesterday anyway
the correct answer is "not enough"
we could always use more potatoes
trynig to get boltor prime now
what skarm
the tsm subreddit discord server is huge
yo anyone want hate i got a spare
last year, the most passive aggressive class(es) were geometry, earth science, algebra 2, and thats about it, they were all equally passive aggressive
also salty
i loved earth science a lot actually
huh. maybe it was the teachers at my school. we had really bad science and math teachers
you'd think it'd be higher
im with you gummy
i agree
and chemistry sounded like it sucked for many, so i'll take earth science
chemistry deals with math after all, but the teacher was notorious for not being very good
they weren't very easy essays either
food poisoning is just buckets of fun at kfc
maybe
what the fuck kugal
qdoba is amazing fuk u
taco time
thats where we get tacos
did someone say tacos
can i have any leftover tacos?
tacos and the tears of yellow dragons
take out the tears and you got a deal
ok ok good
though i think it’s to do with this block of buildings
sup pals
i prefer that
mission so far successful
cavalry charges
a massacre
film class showed me a movie on that
ahh i see kugal has discovered the internet
what are the reqs?
complete a survival mission with level 30 or higher enemies without killing anyone
i just don't know if the mod itself is good
last i checked soma was considered good
i'm waiting until a friend gets up to tell me
shit why does that have max disposition
my head feels funny
looks funny too
i'm in the mission
or just shave the entire face
not if you do it properly
be nice flubs
you want me to be nice to my case?
i will give you some of my leftover popeyes chicken
thats like asking why a baby needs food to live since it needs less than an adukt
speaking of cacti, has that one guy said anything recently?
i havent been paying attention
drago using a good mic
much easier
this does not bode well
nope
darn
weird
stop being so smart you weirdo
the teachers at my school are all pretty darn awesome
i dont want to _that_ much though
where the frig you going
trippy smooth version
khan academy practice problems are a blessing
flights
although to be fair so did my calculus teacher
because their solidifying the fact that im not a moron and i can actually do the material
i hated mike and a little bit of zven and mithy
not after what he just did on stream
yeah
other pros are upset
anyways brb playing aatrox
though i rather c9 go to worlds
there are a lot of super nice players in lcs
see drago
here's the other thing
nah listen anyways
i have a thing due for creative writing class on monday
four to seven pages
so i have an hour before class starts so im screwing around in the computer lab trying to salvage my writing thing, and the more i read it the more i hate it
ooh that’s pretty
nice
should probably also farm derilect survival for octavia more
what do you have in your inventory that you're so unwilling to part with?
my physics teacher said he likes how he picks on me and i just roll with it
well who knows maybe i deserve it
people are filling in
guess i ought to kick myself off the phone now
if you bend it far enough _everything_ can be an integral sign
because 3 digits isnt too much but 4 is
and whats your ipv4 being ab.cd.ef.10 would sound silly
this is changing the subject a bit but my teacher wanted to do audio stuff in js today
master what are you even doing in there
today is going to be a fun lesson
tell homework to stop, then i might be able to ✨
poor you <:kappa:374346980136058893>
t=+2.5 hours and we're finally doing something in class yay
nobody does
well, there's no such thing as a stupid question
thats why we elect to ignore it
though some are admittedly purposely made stupid, for jokes
there are no stupid questions, but there are stupid people asking such questions
because people use the definition of stupid so loosely, getting a fact wrong makes some people go from sir isaac newton to nemrod in some people's eyes
oh cool so the new 2000 series cards are a waste of time
remake voicemeeter banana in js. <:keepo:327304799919800321>
ah, gotcha
you know how a couple
now her internet is out and she has barely any data left

my advice is stop being a bitch baby and if they want to be a bitch baby let them
hint: its ketar
home depot is the fucking best
home depot is great
it's torture
because i was boosted and briefly thought guardian was aftershocik
they also have metal
i oddly enjoy looking at stuff i can’t buy and have no use for
so you can find what you want, write it down, and then buy it from somewhere specialized
rona is better
it's bad
both places were good but we go to lowes more now
even though i have no need for hardware
gummy be nice to the hardware stores
tahts it im getting the pulley and rope kit
yeah
its like bitcoin but for rats

i don’t want
how was i supposed to know drago
oh the history major thing
but still
thankfully i only need get the intro paragraph done by the end of this week, but i'll probably try to put out an entire draft so i have a bit of a buffer.
i dont even like _one_ -page essays
by the way, i get docked points if i go over five pages.
balls javascript doesnt have a `choose` function
well thats sucky
yo drago
it missed obviously.
this is very disheartening
in other news it turns out there's a "fear of chickens" and it's called "alektorophobia"
i like chicken

idk what a phd is
okay yeah, they do
yeah we have that
lol right
through a lot of work and perseverance
often 8 +
yea if you're getting a phd you're basically saying you want to stay in school until you're like 30 +
oh hell no
my mom went back to school at 36
if you wanna teach you gotta definitely get masters
demon lord did you here
i quit film like a month ago lol.

"stop doing stupid things"
don’t get a girlfriend

and girls don’t get a boyfriend
ha ha
remember stay single and don’t do hard drugs
im not single
you might end up with a guy who is insane or a girl who is insane
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
drago
i still blame youtube for why i hate film class
there is tension
5? i think you may need to say it more
hah. time zones.
i need a phone with 8 gb ram to handle my spreadsheets
damn sleep
gotta do 5 waves with objective taking no damage on lvl 30+
joaquin phoenix as joker is actually really freaky
hello there

kugal stop being smart its too impressive
i did use a spreadsheet to check myself though
uh, **yeah**
with a fork
<:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
oh trust me, i'm going as fast as i can
that needs to be an emote somewhere
or maybe just that boy with the hat
hes been broken fora while now
it's the sylveon pfp
youd need like 15 of them though
kavat cudes up rn if you need them
there are zero outcomes where "playing league" ends in "win"
and then i wonder hte next day why i woke up after noon

my irl sister caught a cold
sorry to hear that flubs

~~wasn’t the internet always stupid?~~
im gonna zone out to space music the rest of the day
so you’re jealous of me <:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
but then again driving on li looks horrible
vsauce michael here
thatd be pretty cool
unfortunately the people who do drunk driving and road rage also happen to be the people who are least likely to give up their keys
let me introduce you to this nifty little thing called "human nature"
through x^.5 form or?
same
6th i think actually
or something like that, lol
im guessing itd just be the factorial of the factorial of the original number
yea i think i may just use double factorial
i just gave you a much better name for it
kugal is a happy boi
english. which is the most fun one i’ve been in, so the weird looks i get sometimes for saying it are worth
man one assignment for literature takes a few solid hours, its impressive
english teacher?
don’t know yet
though i think i want to try out the market aspect of it too, since i was gonna be marketing in a way
onkko's quotes give me a headache yet they almost make sense
author master
i’ve come to realize i’d rather be happy and doing what i like than be unhappy and dreading work everyday
yeah but being an author is risky and dependent on success
which is nice
good idea
oh yeah peaceful places
who?
i should teach kids war
play them my songs in return
you said horrible woman right?
let me think
i tried to listen to that but i couldn't finish
rep’s top ten for me
night time
how the fuck will more music help me hear less music
i havent looked
mostly chroma doing tons of dmg
3 teralysts, one gantalyst, and one hydrolyst
oh yeah and about 400 vomvalysts but those die so easily i lost count
probably
gummy dont you have anything better to do
i’ll let you know
stellacor

who says flubs can't be both
i had curly fries
im docking your pay until you improve
its all easy from here
but i have stat work
huh, is that right? lol
on a closed interval
wait is it without getting detected or
oh that's easy
i ran ivara stuff way too much
you have thermite rounds?
its a t3r3 low chance drop
iirc i got pretty lucky with t3
pluto junction here i come
good job
thanks!
master how much do ayatan sculptures sell for again
orta is like the second best price one
i just look at the wtbs until i see a good one
alright i found a buyer
have fun

sedna has an interesting side character
after 7 more missions than shouldve happened
ty for reminding me to grind mesa
i have a key left if you two want to use it
thonk
very appropriate
i remember watching nsmb walkthroughs when i was like 7
it's actually not
that's really sad
i started watching during pokémon diamond
there was never a time in my life where having a nintendo system was "cool"
that being said i am going to buy a 3ds when i get a job
it's my sister's
i can probably disassemble my old half broken dsi
ya gotta believe
wait switch _is_ ninth gen
honestly the only consoles worth getting are nintendo consoles
win + x -> u -> r
yeah im not pressing those keys
nice
pi with toast
i didnt eat lunch today
or breakfast
well thats why we call it a raspi usually
i dont think mac users breathe
imagine paying $2000+ for a phone and still not getting a fast charger
there are phones that cost over $2000?
yeet selling out is awesome
oh wait my sub expired
life goals
yay its early
what the crap it's autumn now?
yeah its the worst season
god all four seasons are just godawful arent they
wow this is.. a lot
so there's that
i say to the canadians in the room
<:lul:305559915714576385>
also drago you forgot the *allergies* in the 3 that arent winter
also new york snow is fuckin garbage
its just slush
it's the effect of the lakes
explain like im someone who's so lazy theyre lying down in their desk chair and typing with the keyboard above their head
well that's rude of it
you don't
not looking forward to walking to the bus stop in -20 weather tho
someone kill me now
you forgot on your seasons suck chart
winter time is skyrim time
winter time is magfest time but im pretty sure thats just because winter coincides with when the convention center is cheapest
no squid would be playing it on a smart window
squid is normal hes prolly asleep
what a friggin nerd
the people you go on discord with
that takes skill
if they ever do you restart
it's like a thing that people did to amuse themselves before the internet
something bad happen
i nearly died
just finished it
to the end of the map
to mot
there we will find the next step of the story
someone told me to go to sleep
but it's only 3 am
or i could sleep bye
zenurik is super strong energy regeneration
allows you to take an aura like corrosive projection
sounds fun
cetus makes way more sense now
and now that you can hunt teralysts you also have arcane buffs to start collecting
as per usual
like +30% strength
it’s cool that they gave a riven
what's the challenge?
gonna try to sleep now
guys
you say that like it's a good idea but then you realize steam games take a month to patch/download there
whats the difference between a butt ton and a normal ton
assuming the butt is predominantly meat with a small layer of fat
i think you mean a shit ton
its so much easier
\:thinking\:
oh you mean ripping off of r/writingprompts class
goood
just bp/mods/ayatans
flubs convince him
i realize drago has beaten me in every social media
minus the "social" part
on every site
_why_ do you have a deviantart
this is going to be like the old days of youtube when your only impressions were you and your mom isn't it
they can *do* that?
gonna go watchwestwing();}
arrest him
that's what "formatting" means right
i thought windows used ntfs
"well we've already shipped fifty million of the things, too late i guess"
maybe i can misspell all of the names a different way every time and see if anyone notices
break time
*breaks dra*- oh wait, he did it himself
how long is break time?
make what a thing
you don't know about that meme, majestic?
but you can't
all you have to do is dip a piece of paper in the septic tank and then take a picture of it with a really low-quality camera
or if you're behind the times, impact font.
now i want to google "corrosive font" and see what comes up
would corrosive font be writing with acid?
latin likes to play loose
i dont think this one has a right answer
i sent the prof an email about it too
rates of change and other not-exciting stuff
i don't blame them <:ceselalul:428570630254755840>
nothing like a great russian guitar fix guide to help you focus on homework
master who docks their task bar on the _right_ side of the screen honestly
byebye pins

im sleepy
hi sleepy
as you know, fred
"urgh, why do i have to 'sign in' for everything? it's all these companies trying to collect big data on you!"
"acually (a) it's been like that since the dawn of the internet, and (b) have you tried 4chan?"
it's all mems
sorry was looking at the wrong picture
everything's a library card if you bribe the librarian with enough
good thing i have a few more pairs of pants and all those trousers that the flat earth folks sent me
excuse you my trousers are stellar
well it's actually more like a record label
woah
stardust protection
they're an emerging marketplace right now
i'm going to file that under "could be worse"
basically
still, this is interesting to say the least
its like calling mtv a song producer
perfectly balanced
that was master's bad idea not mine
why is justin beiber listed twice on the top hundred youtuber list
gummy just finish moon already i want to wipe the floor with you
no she is pissed at you
actually
yes yes yes yes
youtube is dead to me
oh hey alan walker is in top 100
16,318,782
16,318,782 as of whenever the public count was last updated
wack
hmmm
when i first watched they had 200k subs
now they have 1.2 million subs
i still don’t get why they are a thing
its unboxing
rc have you even _seen_ this guy's content
you take one to solstheim or however you spell it
i love the 18th century
bella they dont even have guns they arent the smartest folk
yeah but how was i supposed to know that
the one easiest to remember thats non dlc is the one with one of the guilds
oh yeah in dark brotherhood questline you murder the emperor while hes on his ship
but like how dont they have guns in skyrim
gouda?
thank you
wow they have analytics from the 20s?
sweden is a myth
league is a lot more popular internationally
of course interest in memes increase over the years
no notifications except for the guy who i'm trying very hard to avoid
one of these is nto like the others
great, now i'm tempted to watch crash course videos for the rest of the night
dragonite: 1; dragonite: 0
`how not to set your pizza on fire: crash course engineering #15`
there was
ahoy
that's going on reddit
looks liked he helped in some way
my textbook is advocating for the use of xml
the copyright date is 2017
whats xml
would you rather stick each individual sheet of paper in its own envelope and stick all of the envelopes in one big envelope
damn i want to do that now
master know anyone who hates receiving letters?
thats probably how the fcc feels about public comments tho too
virginia tech? yeah they sent me recruiting information well into my twenties also
fortunately i signed up for their email nonsense under an account that i lost the password to so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
also my nose runs
yeah those both blow
is it worth unveiling them?
and saw some stuff
indeed.  welcome to our little slice of discord.
thats almost an improvement!
my class is at noon
my first class gives quizzes exactly at the start.. it sucks
oh i forgot that i blocked mee6
wise decision tbh ll
howdy pals
glad to see everyone doing well
i'm terrified of the normie population
meme day? that sounds awesome
i miss when it was just an obscure nerd thing
take the easy option in this case
blitzypoo
get the dynamite
i love this
swimming's more of a summer activity here
how does exercise remind you of home depot?
they both are bad
anyone remember those nascar shopping carts at home depot
those carts would make 5 year old me so excited
another essay due in english already <:feelsbadman:327312260970315823>
that sounds cruel and unusual
oh yeah and we had a mini argumentative piece in gov that most people wrote over a page for. i wrote half a page talking out of my ass and got 6/6 on it
sound and are are two different things
this whole mornings real odd
same for me
i didnt have that much work, or as much work as i usually have, and my house wasnt freezingly cold like it usually is, and we actually have food to snack on
wow i made it
i went to starbucks
we didn't loose in volleyball that time
no thanks i just ate two slices of terrible pizza
so my three hour class let out after 45 minutes, i went to eat terrible pizza, and now my next class doesnt start until two hours from now
bella want some terrible pizza? the school cafeteria has more of it than they know what to do with
sounds good
it's cold therefore it's christmas
and the hat is my original symbol with the flagship addition and a cursive argo in each triangle
also we got brad nominated for homecoming king and his walk in video didn't have ragnar the red or drunken sailor
so what are you doinh with your life honestly
i remember we got papers or something about it in high school but i never read them
then again
its not like i did anything worthwhile in high school anyway
vote'); drop table candidates --;
maybe if you throw it fast enough you can knock out the power cord or something
>implying there's anything else to talk about
exactly
hey theres plenty other things to talk about
computers cant be science theyre made of rocks and we already know about rocks
and when a robot lands on a square, the square turns black, or when it lands on a black square, it turns white
probably
we can
very badly
for a certain time
oh no this is
but then it starts becoming unpredictable
is the new 3ds worth?
the game of life is the ones where the squares reproduce and kill each other
for example, when asked whether dragonite should fork the doom 3 code, he is probably not going to use it but he probably also doesnt care so he's probably going to do it anyway
ida battle drago pls and destroy him!
with or without the viking swords
i wanted to model langton's ant a while ago but was too lazy
me good at wasting ti.e guys
good job at typos
i did a really good typo earlier
wanna learn history?
<:failfish:372152438355918848>
and there are no paper cartridges
seriously?  you expect minié ball ammunition to be commonplace in this day and age?
even older
where is the love 😭
it is very hard to kill someone with a bb gun
easy to injure them though, so it has some uses
nothing im interested in
video games
but you physically copies are nice for display
humans are nice
<:thinkinator:409416852368785428>
post with a dog in it -> search by controversial
fun times for all
is this like part of your morning routine or something
holding onto some rhino stuff to. should be good
ayatan ayr sculpture
thats a first of those
gummy im bored wanna battle
*sends dragonite to russia* time to get up
maybe that'll save me from pre-cal homework that i'm not even getting graded on
greetings all those who are kind
just saw
how long has it been?
well i got home at 3
its an extra slot for certain frame mods
thanks
with online code shopping
huh, don’t see it
microsoft office
$27 on kinguin
thanks
scrub
since invasions are the only way to get those
i barely got snipetron vandal together
i haven’t unlocked most of sedna so oh well
i can inv you
i still gotta do it to
and then i remembered there was a communications patch taht i havent updated on yet
all good
yeah
take out camera because its kinda funny
actually i think they all are except access and onenote, and who uses access and onenote
oh and guess who cant sleep again
hello person
brb pretending to be productive today
it's windows
got it
that, i’m excited for
> question 56
i did this problem last night
nah, you should know
but if any math nerd can give me their input on that problem #56 *cough* master *cough* spazzer *cough* when you can that'd be great
i’m afraid blitz has... calculus addiction
it’s not surprising, but official
or you could say a= -2/x
but is it differentiable?
the derivative from the left and right side have to be the same
so the first piece and second piece should have the same derivative value at x = 0
me thinks problem is flawed
i did this one in like 2 seconds
that one again, i run into a brick wall
a friend and i were discussing nintendo's new paid online
thats like over double minimum wage
i would understand if it was to keep their own servers running though
havent they always had an ass-stick when it comes to online content?
makes sense
my brain is 50% ponies 50% war
zephyr and a vulkar on earth exterminate
also i'm pretty sure a majority of people make over $41k
and quite honestly
it's not about whether you can afford it, it's about what you're getting in return
does it suck? yeah of course it does
i wasn't complaining, i was just giving my thoughts based on what i've heard
well if the context of the conversation is "hey dont plow our house down"
gum might get to study overseas
im in such a good mood
you should go to somewhere like antarctica
or maybe penguins can study gummyology
you arent allowed to touch the penguins
or get close to them
what do you mean by bike ride
it's the study of motion basically
too late doing calc first
is rate my professor a working thing in canadialand
majestic it isnt butter its a butter subsitute
becoming school teacher is harder than it looks
the classes are way tougher than film
gummy what do you _do_ with a film degree anyway
it sounds almost as useless as a game design degree tbh
film editor or producer for tv shows before moving on to movies or animation
film majors are a necessity for most crews so they’re useful
though it’s good that teacher’s programs aren’t easy.. literally teaching the next generation lmao
community moreso when you wanna transfer... those reqs are no joke
so far only class i like is history
gummy wanna take my writing class for me
hmm, don’t know. i’m sure the boomers will complain about them too so we’ll find out
i already am complaining about college
just saying personally, but the 4 years are a literal 4 commitment so it’s the same thing
those are _all_ true and false
i don’t know how i passed stats
that’s awesome
ring theory is that if something is round and goes on a finger its probably a ring
final*
fuckin sat there doing nothing for two whole hours
i took chem as a senior
i started taking ap chem as a sophomore but then dropped it because i was barely even going to class
i think the highest for freshman here is bio
actually did good
well that’s easy
i mean people in grade 12
i hate grade 0 through 12 people
and most people after 12
no...i think ida was the one hat said she would create a game a something for it
oh gummy _is_ the detention teacher
i’ll remind her
i'm as generic as they come
you could teach the procrastination class on the days that i dont show up
i should probably tag him hun
ok enough of being a huge nurd, time to do dog chores brb again
it's so cool and easy too
except that you have to do it like sixteen times to get a result
as long as you're careful, rock and roll
also i apparently have no role in that sheet
so i'm feeling a bit violent
i was going to say
is that a good thing or a bad thing
it’s normal probably
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
a high male voice in choir
ive actually said many times i am
you have no valid point
ida said something about anime
i'm watching re:zeri
because i do the dumb
ida are you implying that you sleep well _normally?_
ida here the news?
transfer?
well, have fun
(kugal i think that's what he's trying to do)
oh, well cool
my fave prof is my current history prof
or maybe someday you could be a history prof
talking to eyan, will be on eventually
was that because you didnt speak english or because you answered "musket" for every question
should have learnt french instead
i have poems to read. hopefully
i got chewed out in first grade
oh i hate teachers
got pinged twice
@someone else, set it up to ping me whenever someone says gay
ccongrats
hey gummy logic is amazing
i wanna be a teacher so i hate myself
just thought i should share this for context
i still think nintendo should have their own site/system like loveroms and emuparadise with netflix style payments or something to play older games
and it's time for us to leave her
leave'er johnny leaver ohh leaver johnny leavr. for the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
a special fuck you to the guy who looked right at me while i was downed vs the gustrag three in a nitain mission and didn't revive me
~~always bring plasmor~~
oh look it's ten pm and ive done nothing useful today
it's 2 am here
at the same time
<:rooayaya:486235340131139603> i hope you enjoy everything that's not subaru <:rooayaya:486235340131139603>
felix is hot tbh
they should've told the consumers that during the direct so there would be less confusion
teacher got mad at me for using the ternary operator
legitimate question: what's wrong with using a ternary operator?
"that's the point"
goof off in the computer lab by making a program to dispense random calvin and hobbes quotes when called.
im listening to the people next to me try and sort out the difference between java and the motherboard
ahh, freshmen
you could give it all to me
you have no clue what i want do you?
and it's also 700$
so is paint
the yellow part not the 0.7k part
gummy you know you can just use an elgato for that right
the ones with the really fuckin annoying names
what type of drug are you one
no im flubs
whats an fhat
ive seen it
then i don’t have any suggestions
then let me go play minecraft in peace damn it
holy shit
a new game called war of rights
that means rifle muskets and line battles
how is that stupid?
being on the losing side is dumb especially when its by choice
as a zelda nerd, i couldn't be happier xd
melee riven from my sorties

she's on the phone with the manager who's out of country rn
i have places to be so i'm just gonna leave

i can only edit it in/out through canary right now tho
bought tigris build for 80 plat, some trading later am back up to 200
gotta love a free market
...  i think i just spent a half hour looking at a fish
someone needed a lex prime reciever
see i told ya capitalism is good
not in a hurry but yes
i rolled for it like 20 times
cause i still need that
the more the researches cost
almost all research is done, shadow clan
3450 i think
yeah. didn’t know that actually
thanks
also this is happening
jupiter
none of that matters why the fuck would you put that in your resume to literally everything
unless the job has something to do with memes and i know no job like that
ida let me introduce you to these things called "the biggest pages on facebook"
me and my big mouth
>implying facebook meme pages don't steal from reddit too
but reddit steals from 4chan and twitter and twitter steals from reddit. and we all know to stay far far away from 4chan so where is the purest meme source?
stream tomorrow too btw
let the chaos begin in three, two, one . . .
[crickets]
rip i returned to stream gone
~~i take offence~~
is it bad that i bought the skyrim ost almost four years ago and im still not tired of it
like it's practically the only thing i listen to
rise up stormcloaks
sitting is comfortable and rising is hard
if it was easy everyone would do it
im retiring as of 5 hours ago
from what
im coming out of retirement for one last slam
good
the one from the invasion
good job (?)
its the best i can do
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay hiccupping again
submitted my english essay...time for some well deserved sleep
gummy im going to finish arguing with you on twitter later im going to sleep now
wifi located
i just find the last part hilarious
super metroid's?
maybe taken from metroid's guide
unity's z fighting solution is reeeeeaaaaaally baaaaaaaaaaad
you can do that in real life too
i like it when my code is a metaphor for my entire life
"and here we have dragonite getting his eleventh hour of sleep"
here we see the dragonite taking a half hour to get out of bed as he continues to fiddle around with his metal spaghetti dinner from last year
also is it bad that nintendo sent me an email about a pokémon distribution and the pokémon in the picture was completely unrecognizable
what is it
you know the one
the large one
so like
snorlax
thats the boy
good job
the forecast calls for an undefiend chance of dragonite showing up to stream tonight
oh, so he's too busy getting x to divide by zero to get y
yeah, i should've known that joke would fall flat
