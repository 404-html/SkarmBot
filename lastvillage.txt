PKMN03:	Lol
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ

Dragonite:	and the fact that i'm keeping track of it is likely to make her say it even more
Dragonite:	the thing is, will's "lol" stat is mind-bogglingly high
Aqua033:	We should make a counter for how many times I say "Ha," or "Heh"
Aqua033:	Heh
Rainy:	lol
willofd2011:	Ok lol
Dragonite:	so i can get a more accurate stat on how often you say "lol"

Neon Strike Kitty:	Dunno

Kireina:	same
Kugallyblitz:	this is true
superheronerd:	Tastu is full of it, but that's okay
Kireina:	D:
superheronerd:	I accept my fate, panda
superheronerd:	Some friends and I have a group chat called shitpost central
Kireina:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kireina:	Also a terrible waifu
superheronerd:	Actually
superheronerd:	I am a shitpost, so it's suitable.
SuperGummying:	Bella not you as well
Aqua033:	This is getting shitpost-y
superheronerd:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aqua033:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kireina:	LOL
Dragonite:	ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
SuperGummying:	I declare war on Dragonite's faces
SuperGummying:	Dragonite used to spam this all the time
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dragonite:	what about ｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
SuperGummying:	STOP
Kugallyblitz:	wow gummy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ lives matter
superheronerd:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aqua033:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aqua033:	You must really hate me, then
Dragonite:	why
SuperGummying:	Ugh I hate this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ face
Kireina:	https://www.tatsumaki.xyz/commands.html
superheronerd:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Deino Mite:	Master, did you disable the cute anime girl command?
Kireina:	google
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kireina:	Or disabled them in general
Deino Mite:	What's the command for it on tatsu?
Kireina:	I believe
Kireina:	RM just disabled the NSFW ones
Dragonite:	havent really been paying attention
Deino Mite:	But all of us weebs do need it!
Kireina:	I believe Tatsu does that already
Dragonite:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
superheronerd:	How long did it take to make the bot?
Dragonite:	i feel like one of the other bots already does that, plus i don't feel like it
Kugallyblitz:	i personally despise it with a passion lol
Deino Mite:	Eh, English isn't that bad.
Kugallyblitz:	and i like this idea
Kugallyblitz:	it's english therefore it sounds horrible
Deino Mite:	I have an idea for a command for the bot. Have a command that gets a random cute picture of an anime girl.
superheronerd:	That sounds miserable
Deino Mite:	That's super weird.
Master9000:	We do it in 6 class periods for some reason
superheronerd:	6 days?
Master9000:	I have a 6 day final in English
superheronerd:	You got this, blitz 😄
Master9000:	Yeah you can just ctrl f each user for those statistics
Kugallyblitz:	so I'll be 2 finals closer to summer
Kugallyblitz:	I will be taking 2 finals today
Kugallyblitz:	i like good days
superheronerd:	It's a good day, friendos.
Deino Mite:	Yay bella
Kugallyblitz:	hurray!
superheronerd:	No wasting an hour!
superheronerd:	Managed to wait for the early bus too
Deino Mite:	It does?
Kugallyblitz:	yay bella
Dragonite:	or something
Dragonite:	mee6 already does that though
superheronerd:	Fastest quiz of my life just now
Deino Mite:	Just track what % of messages on the server are from gummy.
Dragonite:	that would only be funny if we could have it compared to how often other people spam the bot, and i don't feel like figuring out how to efficiently track every user on the server
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Deino Mite leveled up!**
Deino Mite:	Can we get a statistic on how much gummy spans from the bot?
Kugallyblitz:	okie dokie
Dragonite:	maybe
Dragonite:	ill run that by eyan
Kugallyblitz:	i think that'd be kinda cool
Dragonite:	hmm
Kugallyblitz:	and its a memorable either funny or like ya know hilarious quote from a stream
Kugallyblitz:	and you can only command it every 24 hours
Kugallyblitz:	maybe there should be a quote of the day from eyan bot
Kugallyblitz:	ok hold on lemme think
willofd2011:	Hi blitz ^w^
Kugallyblitz:	is it me or do our colors look a little brighter or less darker?
Dragonite:	i need bot ideas
Dragonite:	kugal
Kugallyblitz:	hai frands
Kireina:	🤔
Dragonite:	i mean, if you have any more lines for me to add e!dragonite, let's have them
SuperGummying:	Then I'll harass Dragonite
SuperGummying:	I got math
SuperGummying:	Have fun
superheronerd:	I have a quiz. 👋🏼
SuperGummying:	You are supposed to protect me
SuperGummying:	Noooo Bella
superheronerd:	Hah.
Dragonite:	what'd he say
SuperGummying:	Tell him Bella
SuperGummying:	No it doesn't
Dragonite:	it speaks the truth
SuperGummying:	😢
SuperGummying:	Guys the command keeps telling me not to hide behind Bella
Dragonite:	on another unrelated note, i love how many levels i've gained just by testing the bot
superheronerd:	The command about will is the most relevant of all of them so far
Deino Mite:	lol
Dragonite:	eyan is going to return to so many inane pings and think we're even more insane than he already does
Deino Mite:	<@!304073163669766158> btw, in order to make it easier to program i think im going to make the game so you choose a girl and then complete her path before moving onto the next girl and complete her path until youve seduced all the girls unless you really want me to make it so you seduce them all at once
willofd2011:	XD
Dragonite:	Still going strong
EyanSays:	```Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "lol:"100%
Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "XD:"0%```
Dragonite:	e!will
willofd2011:	Yeah lol
superheronerd:	Yeah that is lol
Deino Mite:	actually, thats more of a stream thing
Dragonite:	nah
Deino Mite:	Or how many times I call Eyan onii-chan
Dragonite:	that's hard to determine altorithmically other than "assume every line is something dumb"
Deino Mite:	How many times gummy says something dumb?
Dragonite:	really though, any other stats that i should track here?
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
Deino Mite:	nice
Dragonite:	someone left pants on the floor outside my room
Dragonite:	in other news
Master9000:	Oof
Dragonite:	~~the reason gummy gets one with or without paying is because it's yet another outlet for me to provoke him~~
Master9000:	You get to choose lol
superheronerd:	What would it be?
Master9000:	As long as it's appropriate ofc
Aqua033:	$10 for a command?
Aqua033:	I mean
Deino Mite:	eh, i dont really care if i have a command
Dragonite:	i'm in favor of it purely because it means i'm not obligated to add commands for every pillock on this bloody server
Deino Mite:	#sellout
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> consider that^ lmao
Deino Mite:	Lol
Dragonite:	:^ )
Dragonite:	that's actually not a bad idea
Master9000:	You can donate $10 a month to the koz patreon to get your own command in Eyan-63Y <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deino Mite:	Ah
Dragonite:	i did it for will because i legitimately want to know
Deino Mite:	😦
Dragonite:	nope
Deino Mite:	It doesn't record anything for me?
Dragonite:	nope
Deino Mite:	What does it record for me?
willofd2011:	Lol
Deino Mite:	I want blue so bad! It's my favorite color!
Dragonite:	<@113084295958044672> We can now record how often you say "lol" and "XD"
Aqua033:	I know I am
Deino Mite:	I'm 2 levels away
Master9000:	You're pretty close to it
Aqua033:	*Aggressively spams*
Aqua033:	I wanna get to the new blue
Master9000:	~~you can just spam him till he does the affinity system and you get lightning role~~
Kireina:	If I knew there was yellow I would stayed yellow forever
Deino Mite:	That's all the progress he made after working real hard on it yesterday.
Kireina:	This is rigged
Dragonite:	ehh, i'll just test it on myself first so i dont have to bother you
Deino Mite:	Eyan changed the colors slightly.
Deino Mite:	Ya
Kireina:	Woah people are yellow
Dragonite:	okay, now do it
Dragonite:	it blew up
Dragonite:	oh wait
Dragonite:	<@113084295958044672> say "lol
Deino Mite:	I'd still just rather do it in Java cus I'm learning Java in school so it will be good practice for me as well.
Deino Mite:	Game maker is pretty good.
Dragonite:	ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
Dragonite:	game maker master race
Deino Mite:	But I'd rather do it in Java
Deino Mite:	I actually learned scratch in 6th grade and made a super simplified version of galaga in it.
Deino Mite:	Lol
Master9000:	If you're gonna be doing that you may as well degrade yourself even more and just use scratch at that point
willofd2011:	Yeah XD
Deino Mite:	For the sake of memes!
willofd2011:	You got this lol
Deino Mite:	It will take a while, but I'll make sure I do it and then we can watch Eyan stream it.
willofd2011:	Fun lol
Deino Mite:	So lots and lots of if statements.
willofd2011:	Ah
Deino Mite:	It's going to be a text adventure since I'm making it in Java and I don't know how to do visuals for it.
willofd2011:	Have fun with that lol
Deino Mite:	And Eyan said he would play it on stream
Deino Mite:	I'm making it
willofd2011:	Lol XD
Dragonite:	this is not a game i'm interested in making
Deino Mite:	In the game, the player is Eyan, a transfer student at Zeal High School. The goal of the game is to seduce all the girls in his class, who are coincidently named after people that watch Eyan's stream, and create the ultimate harem.
Deino Mite:	Ok
willofd2011:	I guess? Lol
Deino Mite:	Will are you ok with being one of the girls in Harem of Zeal: the Game?
willofd2011:	I guess not lol
Deino Mite:	Guess there aren't any pokemon in the tall grass.
Master9000:	Weird
Master9000:	I tried sprinting and rolling in the grass and Those didn't work either
Master9000:	Both
willofd2011:	Lol
Deino Mite:	Changed to xd instead if lol
Master9000:	Also record the amount of xd's
Deino Mite:	Lol
willofd2011:	XD
Deino Mite:	Will, is it ok if you are one of the girls in the Harem of Zeal dating sim?
Master9000:	Do it
Dragonite:	i really want to write that bot that assesses how often Will says "lol" now
Master9000:	Nothing
willofd2011:	Who knows it might work lol
Deino Mite:	Try it.
Master9000:	Maybe I need to use these berries
Master9000:	I don't see any still :/
willofd2011:	Lol
Deino Mite:	The plot thickens.
Deino Mite:	Strange
Master9000:	But this is a state park
Deino Mite:	There must be pesticides acting as repels.
Deino Mite:	Then dragonite is probably right
Master9000:	I haven't applied a repel in like 2 years
Master9000:	No
Deino Mite:	Do you have a repel on?
Dragonite:	them damned pesticides
Deino Mite:	What's wrong?
Master9000:	I've been in this tall grass for a while and I still haven't found any pokemon
Master9000:	Guys help
Master9000:	Not if you fail
willofd2011:	But school work is more important lol

willofd2011:	RIP lol
Kugallyblitz:	He was 7 years old
Kugallyblitz:	Gummy ded
Dragonite:	i think
Dragonite:	https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-get-stream

this is more what i'm looking for
Master9000:	I'm gonna set announcements to on in the ocean palace with pings off for time testing
Master9000:	Rip mee6 only has the Reddit and 15 mins late announcements available
Neon Strike Kitty:	Let me know if there's something I might be able to help with
Master9000:	_looks thru mee6 menu again_
Master9000:	I was about to say
Dragonite:	crap, it's in python and idk if it can be translated to js . . .
Dragonite:	https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/43j3eg/is_there_a_bot_that_can_pull_tweets_from_a_user/

this may be promising for one thing but not the other
Master9000:	Yay updates
Kugallyblitz:	got it <:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I need to afk, just a headsup for everyone that I may or may not be moving crap around tonight so if things look different, don't worry.  I'll probably make an announcement of sorts on the blackomen about any adjustments I make should it happen
Master9000:	Mee6 had the option but it's always like 6-15 mins late
Kireina:	I highly doubt years, but yeah might be awhile
Kugallyblitz:	get on it twitch, dammit
KingofZeal:	It'd also help if twitch got around to the subs thing, but that may be months for all I know, hell, maybe years
Kireina:	xd
KingofZeal:	It's currently being worked on
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd appreciate it if you can get the enlightened thing together soon
Kireina:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
KingofZeal:	I can't even get my damn discord server organized.  😛
Neon Strike Kitty:	or programming
KingofZeal:	It's not really a concern of mine atm so no rush
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd offer to help but I don't know anything about bots
Dragonite:	suppose there's always /r/discordapp . . .
Dragonite:	so far i see a lot of things about writing bots for Twitch, but not a lot about just getting the state of a broadcast . . .
Demon Lord 93:	no I can't
KingofZeal:	I really don't want to do that myself, I just do it out of habit
KingofZeal:	Having a bot that auto announces when I'm live would be a great help
SuperGummying:	can you hear me?
Kugallyblitz:	hang on
Kugallyblitz:	not yet
Kugallyblitz:	kk
Neon Strike Kitty:	Most of the time <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	and typically hes the first one to knw when those start <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I would have suggested when he starts streaming but Eyan announces that himself
Master9000:	wait eyan has a twitter? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kugallyblitz:	I had the idea of asking the bot if there would be stream that day but then again thats kinda eehhh
Neon Strike Kitty:	You could have it post in the bot channel whenever Eyan tweets
Dragonite:	tee hee
Master9000:	have it auto record lines from eyan that are between 20 and 250 characters
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ask Eyan for ideas, maybe?
Kugallyblitz:	Im not too sure
Dragonite:	kind of want to do more with it but idk what
Dragonite:	anyone have any more ideas for eyan bot?
Kugallyblitz:	how are my frands
Kugallyblitz:	hi frands
Dragonite:	ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
Master9000:	i gotta go sleep because i just found out i gotta wake up at 6 AM ヽ( ｡ ヮﾟ)ノ
Master9000:	costs 2000 or something
Master9000:	yep
Dragonite:	the i9 was announced yesterday or something, was it not?
SuperGummying:	meh
SuperGummying:	well

SuperGummying:	you're the best
SuperGummying:	thanks master
Master9000:	i left you in a group chat with strike so i wouldnt need your spam
Master9000:	BOIIIIIIIII
SuperGummying:	plan b
SuperGummying:	the email does not work
SuperGummying:	master
Master9000:	you can redownload your own files
SuperGummying:	need to send the audio files to myself
Master9000:	why
SuperGummying:	going to need to borrow the strike account
Master9000:	im assuming 8 threads for the 4790 since its an i7
SuperGummying:	btw
SuperGummying:	master
Master9000:	<@199725993416589313> more expensive isnt always better
SuperGummying:	is that a yes?
Master9000:	close enough
SuperGummying:	No I meant vc
Master9000:	oof
Kugallyblitz:	_kills gummy with -45 remorse points_
Master9000:	:doit:

Kugallyblitz:	thx
Master9000:	_throws two lighstabers to kugal_
Master9000:	kill him
Kugallyblitz:	how do i do this

SuperGummying:	Wanna like entertain me while I edit this?

Kugallyblitz:	huh, interesting
Master9000:	i got all the parts for 453 lol
Master9000:	its still at 409
Master9000:	daaaaamn the price of my build went down like $50 this week for a bit
SuperGummying:	Bella wouldn't hurt gummy
Master9000:	oh right DunkMister Yi
Kugallyblitz:	oh yes
Dragonite:	and your feet
Master9000:	yep
Kugallyblitz:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kugallyblitz:	one knife for each hand
Master9000:	bring two more knives for her got it
SuperGummying:	I'm taking Bella with me on the trip
Master9000:	with or without a knife is yet to be decided
Master9000:	i would dodge it and probably trip you while also hitting you in the neck from behind
SuperGummying:	I would tackle master
Master9000:	btw i suggest getting in the corridors for this song
Master9000:	i feel like i would run into a bunch of weebs if i tried that
Dragonite:	that'll do it
Dragonite:	look for the weirdo with dragon runes on his shirt
Master9000:	does APA format require pages to be numbered?
Master9000:	wait shit
Kugallyblitz:	just look for the curly haired pillock and you'll find me <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kireina:	🤔
Master9000:	i was about to say
Dragonite:	never mind
Dragonite:	that's like half of the dudes at magfest
Dragonite:	wait
Dragonite:	just look for the long-haired pillock and its probably me
Master9000:	and unless he had a giant neon sign above his head, i would probably miss dragonite
Dragonite:	it was an experience
Dragonite:	i was at new york comic con once
Master9000:	i would probably go aggressive on gummy and then act like i usually do afterward
SuperGummying:	Go to comic con
SuperGummying:	Dragonite
SuperGummying:	Well I got no plans besides meeting Bella and attempting to bump into Dragonite
SuperGummying:	Interesting
SuperGummying:	Well
Kugallyblitz:	or bes greeting
Kugallyblitz:	I'd probably be either the most awkward meeting our greeting
SuperGummying:	What if we met irl?
SuperGummying:	What about you blitz?
SuperGummying:	Yeah...
Dragonite:	i'd probably be like "hi, brb bathroom" and then run for the largest crowd i can find and get lost in it
Kugallyblitz:	because you guys take out them mean in chat that you dont have any left for irl
SuperGummying:	Dragonite why do I feel like we would be nice to each other if we met irl?
Dragonite:	that's a pretty expensive trip to go and punch someone and probably get your badge revoked
SuperGummying:	Tbh there are no plans for me to ever meet you guys besides Bella and maybe Dragonite at magfest so I can punch him
SuperGummying:	Meet gummy
SuperGummying:	...
Kugallyblitz:	inb4 gummy thinks red house is gateway to hell
Master9000:	inb4 hobgoblin
Dragonite:	_douses Gummy in green paint and calls him an alien_
Master9000:	<:Yep:318920218279673856>

SuperGummying:	You said you were good
SuperGummying:	Blitz you wanna do my math for me?
Kugallyblitz:	though Im not complaining one bit if it does
Kugallyblitz:	and watch my grade will go up like 20%
Kugallyblitz:	i just resubmitted with a few revisions
Kugallyblitz:	as you guys know, Im like the worst reader to ever live
superheronerd:	So you need to redo it? Or the program is a jerk?
Master9000:	yay radiation poisoning
superheronerd:	I always wanted to read the alchemist o:
Kugallyblitz:	it said redo/resubmitt for a better grade. the feedback was basically "do better"
SuperGummying:	Bella wanna trade?
Kugallyblitz:	and after i submitted and got my god forsaken grade
SuperGummying:	I gotta sit down and do nothing
SuperGummying:	For me
Kugallyblitz:	so I have to do this creative project for the alchemist book
superheronerd:	Whatcha gotta do?

KingofZeal:	^
NightShade:	That's a realization I had to forgive myself for Kugal
Master9000:	_procrastinates even more intensely_
Kugallyblitz:	but with grades you also gotta know not everyone is inhuman and we aren't gonna be perfect all the time
NightShade:	<@!162952008712716288>  I believe in you.
Master9000:	i didnt even make progress on this thing for hte past 6 hours
Master9000:	_looks at english paper and revision history_
superheronerd:	A+ effort.
Kugallyblitz:	yay for distraction
Master9000:	good job team
KingofZeal:	^
NightShade:	I think the discord has very successfully distracted him 😛
Master9000:	_looks at a secant graph to see how far he has distracted eyan_
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I can be quite the perfectionist
Master9000:	u just want it to be perfect?
SuperGummying:	Last semester my final math mark was a 58%
KingofZeal:	Cause I'm so hard on myself, that I get depressed that I'm failing miserably
KingofZeal:	If anything, that may be half the problem
KingofZeal:	I've been having a rough past few years.  😛  Doesn't mean I'm not hard on myself
superheronerd:	My 87 in English bothers me
KingofZeal:	Hey now
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	yea
Master9000:	_looks at the to do list from last week_
KingofZeal:	I've always been strict on my own grades, then again, I've always been strict on myself period
Kugallyblitz:	I have a bad habit of never forgiving myself for like a 70 grade on a thing I easily could've goten like 90 or above
superheronerd:	This is the most strict I've ever been with my grades
KingofZeal:	I too was up my own ass for bad grades also
SuperGummying:	My parents don't care as long as I pass
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> you shouldve seen it when i got a 74 in english when there was an assignment that counted for a quarter of the mp and i couldnt turn it in on time because we were out of town. I thought i would never hear the end of htat one
NightShade:	I was always up my own ass for anything below a 90. My parents didn't care so long as I didn't fail
Kugallyblitz:	I could take 3 finals today thats how close
Master9000:	the best part is i dont even pay attention in class
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	I know the feeling of parents being up your ass for anything less than a 90
Kugallyblitz:	me?
Kugallyblitz:	wow
superheronerd:	How close are you to finals?
superheronerd:	That's unfortunate
Master9000:	<:Yep:318920218279673856>
Kugallyblitz:	your parents?
KingofZeal:	No
SuperGummying:	My grades are around a 70%
Master9000:	anything bellow 90 they flip about
Kugallyblitz:	because you got an 87?
Master9000:	meanwhile im gonna get my ass beat for this
KingofZeal:	I earned an S rank in my heart.  😛
superheronerd:	Because it's on my birthday in the middle of the day, and I would be very sad
superheronerd:	I will hopefully be able to skip out on the optional final for English
SuperGummying:	But yes I probably did good
Master9000:	you sure theres no S rank in that class eyan?
SuperGummying:	No I didn't study
SuperGummying:	I did a math quiz
Master9000:	then again its only 2-3 pages lol
KingofZeal:	Most people only wrote like, 10-15 pages, but I was making sure I walked out of that class with my damn A
Master9000:	we have like a week for this assignment
Master9000:	damn
KingofZeal:	It sounds intimidating, but I spent the whole semester thinking that paper out in my head.  It also flowed really really really easily
Master9000:	_checks all over the server for signs of changes_
NightShade:	I'd write a 32 page paper over taking a 2hr final
KingofZeal:	It was more like a full scale report
superheronerd:	32 pages. That would terrify my English class
SuperGummying:	*hides behind Bella*
SuperGummying:	Oh hey bella
Master9000:	t!remind me eyan and the ~~pizza~~ 32 page paper story in 2 hours
KingofZeal:	Then somebody will have to remind me
NightShade:	^
Master9000:	tell it on stream today lol
KingofZeal:	I'll tell it to you some other time if you remind me
KingofZeal:	It's a long story, lol
NightShade:	<@!304073163669766158>  What on earth did you need to write a 32 page paper for?
Master9000:	still pretty damn good

Master9000:	i dont mind them
SuperGummying:	But I have a reason why
SuperGummying:	I hate poptarts
NightShade:	The only thing confusing me is that I'm out of poptarts
SuperGummying:	I confused regal and night shade lol
Master9000:	somehow i confused regal and blitz there for a while
SuperGummying:	Same ^
NightShade:	I send my luck that it is painless and effective, Regal

regal swan:	hf
KingofZeal:	Imma stop talking so that ya'll don't distract me.  I need some time to sit around and think
Master9000:	next guess is zeal palace
KingofZeal:	And requires me to think about some other stuff that I don't feel like thinking about atm
KingofZeal:	Cause that's a project in itself
KingofZeal:	Yeah, that's not on my to do list atm
Deino Mite:	i believe in you onii-chan
Master9000:	i recommend starting with patreon
Deino Mite:	be productive
KingofZeal:	Which means nothing will probably get accomplished
Deino Mite:	you do that eyan

Zaranius:	Yep i modded it
regal swan:	yep
Deino Mite:	Is that from stardew valley?
Master9000:	I love how launching from my drive with ubuntu it gives me the option to boot windows instead while if I set the SSD with windows on it as the first drive to boot, it doesn't give you any options
Zaranius:	https://gyazo.com/1baa7ec10b67ce0fa63941877f356d5a does this count as cat? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	More cat is ok tho
Master9000:	Not ok
Dragonite:	_poeks master_
KingofZeal:	It was mostly bug fixes, but they did expand upon one of the areas of the game
Master9000:	Ok
Dragonite:	_pokes cat_
Master9000:	Cat
Master9000:	More context about the game?

KingofZeal:	Let's go with that
Master9000:	Do u speak from experience?
KingofZeal:	It's probably not a good idea to f league
Master9000:	*undoes the spell just to make sure Eyan is able to stay alive on his own*
regal swan:	f you too league
KingofZeal:	I realived myself before you did anything, lol
Master9000:	Ok so what those necromancers taught me does work
KingofZeal:	Nah, it's k, I'm alive again
Master9000:	If that doesn't work that means lightning is gonna cause the end of Zeal soon...
regal swan:	lol
Master9000:	*casts revival spell*
KingofZeal:	Don't worry Swan, I wasn't ignoring you, I was just dead

Master9000:	oops

Aqua033:	Only 20 times?
Dragonite:	give me a minute

Dragonite:	"skitty"
Crow_Songs:	fok
Crow_Songs:	fuk
Crow_Songs:	duck
Crow_Songs:	fak
Dragonite:	because i said so
Master9000:	idk why we have the one on fuk since theres just soooooooooooooo many ways to bypass it
SuperGummying:	dragonite why are you still up?
Master9000:	only on f*ck and a few ones that nobody will ever actually say
Crow_Songs:	yea i didn't know there was a swear ban or whatever
Dragonite:	and without any guns
Dragonite:	just without money
SuperGummying:	i am the guy with the money and gun
SuperGummying:	well i mean
Master9000:	you already are
SuperGummying:	can i be bad?
Neon Strike Kitty:	'I believe you find life such a problem because you think that there are the good people and the bad people,’ said the man.  ‘You’re wrong, of course.  There are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them are on opposite sides.'
Dragonite:	i think that was the first time i've seen it yell at a regular user
Master9000:	same
Dragonite:	95% of the time it just yells at the staff anyway
Dragonite:	still voting for the repeal of the word censor
Master9000:	mee6 trolled u sir
Crow_Songs:	ISAY WHAT HAPPENS
Master9000:	wat
Crow_Songs:	you roll
Crow_Songs:	no you see <@!162952008712716288>
Dragonite:	with text that says "supergummying" attached when you ask it to recite the number
SuperGummying:	*waves a french flag at jello's face*
Master9000:	am i doing it right? <@212257792722075650>
Dragonite:	it would basically just be a number that goes up
Master9000:	_rolls a 20 and vaporizes gummy_
SuperGummying:	welp
JelloHammer:	Its just a counter
Master9000:	some sides are just closer to others at times
JelloHammer:	This isnt really a  thing thats against you lol
Master9000:	hes on his own side
JelloHammer:	I mean
SuperGummying:	jello i thought you were on my side
Dragonite:	^
JelloHammer:	Like !cabbage, only a counter for gummy
Master9000:	tough one
Dragonite:	that requires an initial investment of effort, though
Dragonite:	wonder if i should just write code for it now and ask later
Dragonite:	in fact
Master9000:	<:Yep:318920218279673856>
SuperGummying:	nooooo
Dragonite:	as you can see, gummy wants to see this happen as well
SuperGummying:	nooo lillie
willofd2011:	XD
Dragonite:	"five hundred seventy eight"
Dragonite:	"lillie, how many times has gummy died"
Master9000:	thats gonna be tough
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	lmao
Dragonite:	and more specifically, i want to name this one "lillie"
Dragonite:	i want to be the one to harass gummy, though
willofd2011:	*reappears out of nowhere again*
Master9000:	could probably make it happen thru one of those
Master9000:	idk what code is available for mee6 or tatsu
Dragonite:	can you convince zeal to let me make one that's just a death counter for gummy
cadance:	I haven't touched the bot in forever
SuperGummying:	*dodges and shoots dragonite*
Dragonite:	_murders gummy for the ninety first time_
SuperGummying:	isn't that normal mode?
SuperGummying:	um
Dragonite:	_goes blind_
Master9000:	whats wrong with this?
Dragonite:	you all are using outrageously inflated mode
Dragonite:	i use normal mode
Dragonite:	compact mode would be an IRC client
Master9000:	i dont like the compact mode
Dragonite:	no
Neon Strike Kitty:	Compact mode?
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Dragonite:	<@199725993416589313> i assume you mean this: https://twitter.com/DragoniteSpam/status/846569148868120576

Dragonite:	i miss ashbot 0.1
SuperGummying:	I didn't die
Master9000:	try doing it with the t!t thing
Dragonite:	i could do it, but i doubt eyan would let me lol
Master9000:	<@!140627136900759552> you programmed the !death thing in the old bot of zeal right?
SuperGummying:	Sorry was recording my dad and me for my school project
Dragonite:	it would die of integer overflow within about ten minutes
superheronerd:	A bot specifically for it
SuperGummying:	Why
Neon Strike Kitty:	We need a Gummy death counter
Master9000:	ok now i want some lmao
cadance:	Slices bigger than my head too
cadance:	Best damn pizza I've ever had

cadance:	In California though
cadance:	I don't think there's any actual pizza places around here
Master9000:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
cadance:	Yeah
Master9000:	words per min?
cadance:	*sigh*
cadance:	110wpm on computer, fkn 40 on phone
Master9000:	luckily most of the shitty pizza places in this area have fallen out of competition against hte good ones
Dragonite:	;-;
Dragonite:	there are at least four pizza places in my town and they all have gone way downhill
Master9000:	school pizza sucks
Master9000:	well duh
Dragonite:	depends on the source
Master9000:	:PizzaMR:

Luckyskarm:	Ida is not connected
Dragonite:	i can't get into discord format but i do it anyway
Dragonite:	forums are glorious
cadance:	Okay so how is Ida connected
Luckyskarm:	Bella is his older sister, yes
Master9000:	i just couldnt get into the forum format
cadance:	I mean I watched his videos but wasn't on he forums or any of that
cadance:	I was never really a part of the community until twitch but I'm one of the only people he used to have calls with who is still around
JoeDan54:	^
Master9000:	hence time
cadance:	Yeah I've been around forever
Master9000:	something like that, classifying him as "an incest"
JoeDan54:	Oh hi Cadance, I remember seeing you on Eyan's since a long time ago
cadance:	But Bella is his sister right?
Master9000:	i dont really care since im not involved in it
JoeDan54:	I have shop this week and next week so I don't have any imminent homework
cadance:	I thought Ida was gummy's mother
Luckyskarm:	cadance, I'm his mother.
superheronerd:	Rip sleep
Master9000:	there goes my sleep before midnight plan

It's fine though, Otterbox phone cases ftw
Master9000:	i like it but its the one i always forget
Master9000:	i somehow always forget about hte calling lol
JoeDan54:	The Calling is my favorite by the TheFatRat
Master9000:	it would be a mix of vicetone - harmony, mitis - the boy who shattered time, thefatrat - unity, monody, a few more, hes a pirate, the indiana jones and the force themes.
Master9000:	all in one song
JoeDan54:	I love TheFatRat
Him, F-777, Waterflame, and Xtrullor are my favorite Newgrounds artists
SuperGummying:	whats your theme song than?
Master9000:	its not my theme song but i do like his music
SuperGummying:	thats his theme song
SuperGummying:	thats master
JoeDan54:	Whoever just requested a song by TheFatRat has really good taste
Dragonite:	_arrests gummy for indecent exposure_
SuperGummying:	*does stuff in front of dragonite*
Dragonite:	in gummy's case, it's *"only* do things you wouldn't in front of your grandma"
superheronerd:	That has already gone down the drain, no?
Dragonite:	is what it boils down to
Dragonite:	"don't do anything you wouldn't in front of your grandma"
SuperGummying:	no harm
SuperGummying:	hey all i did was kick eyan once
Master9000:	channel purposes are in there too
JoeDan54:	Lmao

superheronerd:	Looking at recycled sculptures atm

Neon Strike Kitty:	You jumped out, then broke the window and ran away?
Dragonite:	you're paying for that
SuperGummying:	*breaks window and runs*
Dragonite:	_slams window shut behind him_
SuperGummying:	*jumps out the window*
SuperGummying:	ida help
Ayana:	​guilty
Neon Strike Kitty:	*testifies against Gummy in court*
SuperGummying:	*shoots dragonite*
Dragonite:	_arrests gummy for destruction of property_
SuperGummying:	*destroys it*
Dragonite:	the peculiarity of its behavior directly correlates with the magnitude of gummy's bullskitty
Neon Strike Kitty:	*chips in for a new bullskitty alarm*
Master9000:	thats a new one
Dragonite:	_'s bullskitty alarm breaks a hole through the wall and goes screaming on down the street_

SuperGummying:	*tackles ida*
SuperGummying:	Fine I'll do my basic
Master9000:	_shoots RPG at gummy_
Dragonite:	"artillery" is a fun word to say
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm sorry, what?
SuperGummying:	*shoots artillery at ida*
Dragonite:	actually that one has questionable pictures in it, let me find a better one
Dragonite:	_pokes gummy with a https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/3388950482 and flushes him down the toilet_
superheronerd:	Because it's a musket.
Neon Strike Kitty:	With a musket you do
SuperGummying:	But I'm a marksman I never miss
SuperGummying:	I know muskets are inaccurate
superheronerd:	That's captain jack sparrow to you.
Neon Strike Kitty:	You know muskets are inaccurate
Master9000:	i guess everyone is jack sparrow now
SuperGummying:	She didn't get hit
SuperGummying:	Is just like jack sparrow
SuperGummying:	Ida
Master9000:	one of these days a musket shot might fly within 100 ft of the target
Neon Strike Kitty:	*sits still*
superheronerd:	_literally all of it misses_
SuperGummying:	*fires a musket volley shot at ida*
superheronerd:	So you have a point
Master9000:	tru
superheronerd:	But nobody uses them anyway
Master9000:	good
superheronerd:	Hey it's not a perfect solution
SuperGummying:	Ida is beating me up 😭
Master9000:	but then you waste money on the equipment to fit them into the launcher
SuperGummying:	*hides behind bella*
superheronerd:	Is to shoot them out of stuff
Master9000:	lmao
superheronerd:	A way to reuse floppy discs
superheronerd:	Guys
Neon Strike Kitty:	*beats Gummy up with a musket*
Master9000:	_shoots 12 arrows all hitting gummy's chest_
Neon Strike Kitty:	Same, Drago

Dragonite:	_loads a USB into musket_
Master9000:	your reply was better its cool
Dragonite:	dammig master
Dragonite:	a very important skill in the age of technology
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sure you do
Master9000:	a useless skill
SuperGummying:	I know how to load a musket
Master9000:	at the very least by that logic gummy is dumber
SuperGummying:	I am smarter
Inferno:	lolwut
Dragonite:	ergo, ida is smarter
Neon Strike Kitty:	So you ask me to teach you and then claim to be smarter than me?
Dragonite:	ida made half a bot, gummy did not
Master9000:	youre definitely not
Neon Strike Kitty:	...what?
superheronerd:	You have much to learn.
SuperGummying:	I'm smarter than ida though
SuperGummying:	.....
superheronerd:	Oh boy.
Dragonite:	that she just called you stupid
Dragonite:	slowly it will dawn on you
Dragonite:	gummy
SuperGummying:	Hypocrite
SuperGummying:	You tell me to study
SuperGummying:	Hypocrite
SuperGummying:	....
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~The smart ones never study~~
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know how to study
superheronerd:	Uni students are odd
SuperGummying:	Teach me how to study for finals pls
SuperGummying:	Ida
SuperGummying:	That's a lie
SuperGummying:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	I realize that hoping the uni students will be more responsible is probably futile
Dragonite:	in other words, you weren't listening
Neon Strike Kitty:	Drinking and smoking is something I saw a lot of in the past years
SuperGummying:	Dragonite they taught me nothing
SuperGummying:	And chewing tobacco
Dragonite:	disappointing
Dragonite:	and yet you still needed the moderation team to teach you about the birds and bees
Aqua033:	Er, Aqua
SuperGummying:	Let's see drinking in class
Aqua033:	I'm 水
SuperGummying:	And yeah....I see a lot of inappropriate stuff

Master9000:	Rip
Necro:	No I don't even have a working computer at the moment
Master9000:	Does anyone here use Linux?
Necro:	It is and since it has such a long lasting power supply you can use it constantly
Master9000:	Well at least he admits it
SuperGummying:	Muskets
Master9000:	The holographic projector sounds awesome
Master9000:	Muskets
Necro:	What the projected or the musket thing gummy is talking about <@162952008712716288>
Master9000:	That's a huge waste of resources and interest by the people
SuperGummying:	I need more musket scenes
Necro:	And due to the composition of the project outer shell is indestructible except using enormous amounts of heat and pressure and my power supply is that of a uranium alloy that has a half life of 210 years so any attempts to destroy said projector is impossible by your feeble attempts <@199725993416589313>
SuperGummying:	Master
SuperGummying:	Muskets
willofd2011:	Lol
Kugallyblitz:	And you dont have the accuracy to get me sooooooooooo

Neon Strike Kitty:	Rico?
SuperGummying:	And I thought Rico was in London
SuperGummying:	I mean I thought Dubai was in India
Neon Strike Kitty:	Did you fail Geography?
SuperGummying:	Yeah Europe
superheronerd:	One of these things is not like the others
Dragonite:	🤔
SuperGummying:	Top three LA, Iceland, Europe
Neon Strike Kitty:	Nope
Dragonite:	_hands Ida an extra battleaxe_
SuperGummying:	Visit me
SuperGummying:	Oh Ida
superheronerd:	Heck yeah.
Neon Strike Kitty:	For me it's kind of Ireland, Norway and Canada for my top 3
NightShade:	*high fives bella*
superheronerd:	Dude nightshade that is a top three place for me
Dragonite:	:^)
Dragonite:	they have sheep in ireland
SuperGummying:	There's still the mall
SuperGummying:	Bella you wouldn't be the full full reason
Neon Strike Kitty:	I kind of wanna move to Ireland
NightShade:	I really want to visit New Zealand ❤
superheronerd:	Ah I'd love to see Ireland
Dragonite:	ireland does too, and i think a few other countries
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's just England that does that
Neon Strike Kitty:	What
Dragonite:	you rang
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dragonite
Luckyskarm:	I'd rather go to Canada then be in america
superheronerd:	In fact that makes it worse, because I would be the reason, so
SuperGummying:	Nah I still rather meet you than go to Europe if I had a choice
Dragonite:	but they drive on the wrong side of the road in Europe
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd rather go to Europe than America
superheronerd:	Because EUROPE.
superheronerd:	Yes.
SuperGummying:	Bella would it still make you sad that LA is number one on my list because I wanna meet you?
superheronerd:	This conversation hurts a lot, nightshade ):
Neon Strike Kitty:	Then is pretty much everything else
Neon Strike Kitty:	Than is connected to rather
NightShade:	This conversation hurts a little. I love to travel D:
Neon Strike Kitty:	Consider it this way
SuperGummying:	Then then then
superheronerd:	That sentence saddens me still
SuperGummying:	God damn it
Neon Strike Kitty:	*then
Neon Strike Kitty:	<@!162952008712716288> It's a disaster!
SuperGummying:	If it's Europe than meh
SuperGummying:	Anyways where was I go on vacation?
SuperGummying:	Interesting
Luckyskarm:	in mee6 yes
SuperGummying:	Lol
SuperGummying:	Oh god
SuperGummying:	I'm first?
SuperGummying:	I would cry
SuperGummying:	I mean if I go to Dragonite's house for a vacation
Luckyskarm:	Grats Gummy on being in first
superheronerd:	Wow
Dragonite:	i call hax
Dragonite:	what is this madness, gummy and i are in agreement for once
SuperGummying:	Depends where I go
SuperGummying:	Like I said Bella
SuperGummying:	Thanks Ida
superheronerd:	That's the whole fun of vacation!
SuperGummying:	It's a place I wanna go
SuperGummying:	I hate it more unless
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Then
SuperGummying:	And if I have to travel
superheronerd:	Dude.
superheronerd:	O:
SuperGummying:	Than I hate it
SuperGummying:	If it's a leave a house thing
SuperGummying:	Depends what kind of vacation
NightShade:	Vacation is nice, if you want to be there
superheronerd:	How does one hate vacation
SuperGummying:	Bleh hate vacation
superheronerd:	Yay vacation!
MajesticEclipse02:	*is happy because on vacation*
SuperGummying:	I feel proud
SuperGummying:	Yay first compliment ever from Ida!
Neon Strike Kitty:	Maybe you'll get high marks this time
Neon Strike Kitty:	Keep at it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Good job
SuperGummying:	I didn't goof off
SuperGummying:	Ida I paid attention in class today
superheronerd:	Oh that's bad timing. Tomorrow, maybe?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'll believe that when Deci stops being salty, Gummy
NightShade:	Yep. Including the place with my new glasses
superheronerd:	Aren't most places closed today?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sure
MajesticEclipse02:	*lurks*
SuperGummying:	Ida I do learn
Neon Strike Kitty:	Maybe when you're in your 80s
Neon Strike Kitty:	One day you'll learn to face your mistakes
superheronerd:	O: kitty.
SuperGummying:	There we go all safe now
SuperGummying:	*hides behind bella*
NightShade:	Hiya Gummy!
NightShade:	I have a kitty on my lap demanding attention, and it's just so sweet ❤
SuperGummying:	Hey night shade
NightShade:	Hiya Bella! ❤
SuperGummying:	Gummy has returned after learning about credit
SuperGummying:	*ahem*
superheronerd:	Hello nightshade!
NightShade:	I'll stick with my science classes. You're brave
superheronerd:	That's rough.
superheronerd:	Dude
Inferno:	so im hoping to get a good mark via tests, because as long as I have like an 80, Bombing the final doesnt fail me
Inferno:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Inferno:	I just finished the first Era
Inferno:	due june 28th
Inferno:	yup
NightShade:	o.o That's quite a project
Inferno:	its a timeline of the entire Catholic faith
Inferno:	it has to be done on paper
NightShade:	Can google save your project?
Inferno:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Inferno:	so
Inferno:	its religion, so its not too important, but im gonna bomv the final project because I dont understand it and this teacher is garbage
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't take after Gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well focus on that then
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Inferno leveled up!**
Inferno:	studying for a test in like 20 minutes
Neon Strike Kitty:	Playing solitaire
NightShade:	What's everyone up to?
Inferno:	but yeah, arrows are Jank
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hi Nighshade
Inferno:	Grats
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm bad with terms
NightShade:	I got out of work really early today! Woo!
Inferno:	you can force a neutral get up with them
Inferno:	terms
Inferno:	wait, right
Inferno:	they have a weird amount of knockback. considering they can both kill, and you can lock with them
Inferno:	plus you can snipe jumps
Inferno:	more charge=more KB
Inferno:	depends on the charge
Neon Strike Kitty:	and now you tell me you can KO with them?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Like the enemies would just brace themselves instead of getting knocked back
Inferno:	thats what makes it funny
Inferno:	yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	They always just seemed to have a sort of ouch hit
Inferno:	and bayonetta bullet arts
Inferno:	the only projectile without knockback in Sm4sh is fox lasers
Neon Strike Kitty:	wtf
Inferno:	yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	The arrows have knockback?
Inferno:	and I just boop them with an arrow
Inferno:	They are right at the kill zone
Neon Strike Kitty:	Right beside the blast zone?
Inferno:	and I have gotten many a kill by sniping people right beside the blast zone
superheronerd:	Silly alien nerds.
Inferno:	I play a large amount of Link in Sm4sh
Kireina:	xd
Inferno:	I find that amusing
Kireina:	He basically just rips through alien nerds like it's breaking a pencil
Kireina:	I believe
Kireina:	Sniper
Inferno:	xD
Inferno:	I dont even know myself
Neon Strike Kitty:	What class is Inferno?
Inferno:	I'll probably swing by the next stream then
Inferno:	Cool
Kireina:	yeah
Inferno:	me?
Kireina:	You becoming a beast in XCOM
Inferno:	0/
Kireina:	Hey Inferno o/
Inferno:	lol
Inferno:	Also, Hello and Goodbye Eyan
Inferno:	*Crawls out of Hole*

When im not in class im practicing Smash. I need to be more active... Send help
willofd2011:	Later eyan ^w^
Kireina:	get stronk
Kireina:	Gain some muscles
Zaranius:	ok catch ya later Eyan
superheronerd:	See ya eyan
Neon Strike Kitty:	I need to write an RP post
KingofZeal:	See ya'll, fun chatting
Kireina:	yeah
Kireina:	Alright, have fun xd
KingofZeal:	Anywho, I think I'm going to actually go cut the grass now, lol
superheronerd:	I find it enjoyable, but I don't have enough time to get all the cards and keep up
Kireina:	although I can get to rank 15 somehow w/ whatever random deck I have
Kireina:	in order to have a decent chance >_>
KingofZeal:	I think that's more people than you think.  😛
Kireina:	Though thats probably because you have to continously play it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eyan mentioned Xeon and not Cadance because Xeon's online
Kireina:	I also enjoy hearthstone surprisingly to a decent extent, although I hate playing it myself
superheronerd:	Can't wait for what's to come
willofd2011:	Same Lol ^w^
Kireina:	Yeah, I enjoy the new games
superheronerd:	Sounds great 😁
KingofZeal:	Also Bella, I think moving forward with the stream, I'm definitely going to go more of a variety streaming route so there will be plenty of new and random things to enjoy.  It seems like stream has been a lot more exciting as of late
Kireina:	I demand we start a straw poll to get gummy in more dangerous positions
KingofZeal:	I've really been not investing into armor like I should this playthrough tbh
KingofZeal:	Most of my investments have been into weapons
Kireina:	damn
KingofZeal:	As far as I know, it's not an XCom 2 thing Panda unless it was added in LW
Kireina:	That way Gummy can get shot out of the sky
superheronerd:	It's pretty enjoyable 😁
Kireina:	or is that not a thing in XCOM 2
Kireina:	When do snipers get them sick jetpack things
superheronerd:	Yeah, but they go by so fast to me
KingofZeal:	To be fair, I've basically been playing non-stop 6-8 hour streams Bella.  😛
Kireina:	blow shit up
Kireina:	Sick
superheronerd:	Wow
superheronerd:	already?
KingofZeal:	Golden path missions are missions you have to do for story progression.  Before, you used to just stealth most of them, so I don't know how they'll go now.
KingofZeal:	I'd say that'd be a fair estimate
KingofZeal:	It's honestly going to depend on how the golden path missions go
Deino Mite:	So like 2 more weeks?
KingofZeal:	As for finishing the playthrough, I'd say we're getting close to about 60ish%
KingofZeal:	Vanilla is significantly more digestable for a new player, LW is where you get the thrill of complexity
superheronerd:	I like its complexity
Deino Mite:	How long do you think it will be before you finish this play through?
KingofZeal:	XCom 2 has definitely become one of my favorite games ever.  I'd probably put it minimum top 15, probably top 10
KingofZeal:	I'll likely do another XCom playthrough again some day, but I'll probably wait for another big LW patch.  There's also rumor of an expansion coming to the vanilla game, but still no news on that yet.
superheronerd:	But it seems worth it
superheronerd:	Yeah I can see that
superheronerd:	Not just because I am one, they just stood out the most to me.
KingofZeal:	If I were to do another campaign from scratch, I'd do a ton of things differently
KingofZeal:	They are, the only issue is they require a lot of investment
superheronerd:	Psi ops look super fun
KingofZeal:	I'm primarily concerned with getting people domination and void rift cause those areht OP perks
KingofZeal:	I think in LW, there's a limit to how many perks you can take
KingofZeal:	In vanilla, you could get all of them
willofd2011:	Interesting lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	It's cause Psi Ops can take multiple perks from the same perk row
superheronerd:	I didn't know that
KingofZeal:	Psi Ops are on a different ranking system
willofd2011:	Me neither lol
KingofZeal:	Neither do I
superheronerd:	Huh.
superheronerd:	I don't even know my rank
superheronerd:	You know
KingofZeal:	I also will be picking up the one thing that makes odds of bleeding out higher and the higher ranking a soldier, the more likely they bleed out.  Thus, anyone who's probably tech sergent or above is gonna likely be safe.
Luckyskarm:	Fire Emblem
Kireina:	FE? <:GoldChamp:225843320134434820>
Kireina:	xd
KingofZeal:	I don't know what my fire emblem plans are
superheronerd:	He has never played before tho
KingofZeal:	I'd say this though, at this point, it's probably unlikely that any of the veterans who've been in the campaign for a while now are dying barring a total disaster like what happened with the beserker queen.
willofd2011:	Lol
Deino Mite:	Eyan, when you stream fire emblem, are you gonna play no casualties on lunatic and restart the level if someone dies?
regal swan:	true but harsh
Kireina:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
KingofZeal:	No, because everybody has a 0% chance at a second life.  😛
Kireina:	Would fred have higher chances of getting a second life then cadance? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	But of course  😛
Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	I enjoy the fact that cadance was not mentioned
KingofZeal:	Also, he only went on one mission.  😛
Deino Mite:	I use Mila's Turnwheel in echoes for rng assurance.
KingofZeal:	I'd give Lightning and Xeon second lives before Fred
Kireina:	I miss fred :^(
Kireina:	Dammit
KingofZeal:	lol
superheronerd:	I can't wait to get my charger this week so I can finally play FE again
Kireina:	<:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
KingofZeal:	No
Kireina:	Is this a foreshadowing that Fred gets a second life?
KingofZeal:	I'll do it later, I wanted to add an extra announcement or two
Deino Mite:	I do that in fire emblem, but it's a complete restart of the level.
Neon Strike Kitty:	No one cared about Fred
Neon Strike Kitty:	I do it all the time in FE
KingofZeal:	I know
Kireina:	😦
Kireina:	you never announced Fred's death
Kireina:	Eyan
Deino Mite:	Ah
KingofZeal:	Reloading the game from a prior save point when something doesn't go your way
Deino Mite:	What is save scum?
KingofZeal:	Overall, your squad has had 2 deaths I think Ida, but one was Fred who replaced Neptunia.
KingofZeal:	A lot of people save scum Bella.  This is probably the closest I've ever been to a legit ironman playthrough
Neon Strike Kitty:	So how many deaths have there been in squads I was on?
superheronerd:	This game would stress me out too much
KingofZeal:	He was the best soldier I lost hands down
KingofZeal:	He was replacing the only loss we've had that actually left a hole in my roster imo which is Neptunia
KingofZeal:	Yes
Neon Strike Kitty:	Was he replacing someone?
KingofZeal:	Most of our losses thus far in the campaign have actually been low ranking people.  Even when we lost Xeon and Lightning, they were still relatively weak soldiers
superheronerd:	That stinks
KingofZeal:	It was his first mission too.  😛
KingofZeal:	He was a champ tanking a lot of shots too
willofd2011:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	I agree, shame he had to die.  He did die for your squad more or less
superheronerd:	Fred is really nice
superheronerd:	Ah that's a shame
KingofZeal:	No Bella, Fred hasn't showed up at all since the campaign started as far as I'm aware
Deino Mite:	F
Zaranius:	True
KingofZeal:	If I put my snipers in a position where they're gonna die, it usually means everyone's screwed
Dragonite:	press F to pay respects
Zaranius:	Yeah i thought we were going to lose someone to the M2 Faceless
superheronerd:	He hasn't been around lately has he?
superheronerd:	Nooo not Fred D:
KingofZeal:	It was a solid night overall
Deino Mite:	For future reference, I'll always vote for whatever gets gummy killed.
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **KingofZeal leveled up!**
KingofZeal:	Just one, Fred the Wooper
Zaranius:	Hey Eyan did we lost anyone last night?
Deino Mite:	Ah
superheronerd:	Gotcha.
KingofZeal:	And that's why I didn't want to do it.  😛
KingofZeal:	Tl;dr, the alien ruler DLC is awful
KingofZeal:	We also would have had to abandon the mission
Animal_Glue_:	lol yup
KingofZeal:	LW2 actually made good changes to it, but I still made wrong assumptions on their mechanics
superheronerd:	So I'm assuming this was the pivotal decision?
Animal_Glue_:	lol
KingofZeal:	Everyone voted no save scumming, although I did actually save scum once purely out of learning how the mechanics work for the alien rulers.  I wouldn't have done it, but that DLC is the epitomy of crap design
Animal_Glue_:	XD
Animal_Glue_:	I wanted it to happen tbh just cause it would make things interesting
superheronerd:	Kinda sad I missed it
superheronerd:	That would have sucked, then.
Animal_Glue_:	yup
KingofZeal:	Yes
KingofZeal:	Actually, gummy probably had the best odds of living there, but only cause he's a sniper and I keep my snipers safe usually
superheronerd:	Is that true
superheronerd:	I heard I was on this squad that nearly died
Animal_Glue_:	cya gummy
SuperGummying:	Bella I'll hide behind you when I come back
Animal_Glue_:	gummy should be ded but save scum
SuperGummying:	Gtg guys class
KingofZeal:	But then everyone made it out anyways minus Fred, still need to remember to post his death message
Dragonite:	fun
SuperGummying:	....
KingofZeal:	You actually weren't on the mission your squad almost got squad wiped
Animal_Glue_:	thats mean
SuperGummying:	Awww the sucks
KingofZeal:	No
Dragonite:	i haven't been to stream in a little while, have i died yet?
Dragonite:	speaking of which
KingofZeal:	lol
Dragonite:	you should stream in your grass cutting shorts again so people continually question whether you're wearing pants
Animal_Glue_:	OF ALL THE DAYS
Animal_Glue_:	literally all of my friends are mowing the lawn today
KingofZeal:	In other news, I'm trying to work up the energy to cut the grass and I don't want to
KingofZeal:	If I didn't save scum, it probably wouldn't have been a squad wipe but more people would have died probably
SuperGummying:	*starts to cry*
Dragonite:	^
Animal_Glue_:	^
KingofZeal:	I think you do a good job of encouraging them yourself
SuperGummying:	Eyan don't encourage them to poke fun at me 😢
Animal_Glue_:	I'm good how bout u?
Animal_Glue_:	rekt
Dragonite:	math
KingofZeal:	Enjoying seeing Gummy in that chair
superheronerd:	How are you doing today
superheronerd:	So guys
SuperGummying:	Help me get out of this chair
SuperGummying:	Come back
SuperGummying:	Noooo Bella
Animal_Glue_:	XD
superheronerd:	_freedom_
SuperGummying:	Noooo Dragonite stop
SuperGummying:	I'll just be behind
Dragonite:	consider this a form of therapy
SuperGummying:	Bella can face it for me
Dragonite:	_nails Gummy to a chair and sticks the chair in the middle of the room_
SuperGummying:	I'm a coward
Deino Mite:	or better yet, dont hide and face my magic like a man
Animal_Glue_:	gummy come up with a new thing to start hiding behind pls
SuperGummying:	*goes back behind bella*
willofd2011:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
Dragonite:	(－‸ლ)
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're actually asking?
SuperGummying:	Wait Ida would hurt me wouldn't she?
Neon Strike Kitty:	"When your back's against the wall, Commander Vimes is right behind you"
SuperGummying:	Alright that's better 😋
SuperGummying:	*pulls ida out of the wall*
superheronerd:	Hug the wall
superheronerd:	So that may not be wise
Neon Strike Kitty:	My back's against the wall
superheronerd:	She has the chance to hurt you though
Dragonite:	that sounds even worse
superheronerd:	Sorry ida.
SuperGummying:	Plan b says hide behind ida
SuperGummying:	Don't worry Eyan
willofd2011:	Lol
Dragonite:	_calls in a crane machine and moves Bella out of Gummy's reach_
willofd2011:	Mhm lol
KingofZeal:	One of these days, she's just gonna move and leave you standing there like a derp
superheronerd:	I'm watching a show about interventions.
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ
SuperGummying:	At all now
SuperGummying:	I'm not moving
SuperGummying:	*stays behind Bella*
Dragonite:	_'s minecraft requirement has not been met in a while . . ._
Dragonite:	speaking of which
Neon Strike Kitty:	omfg my house has a door now
Deino Mite:	*hits gummy with fireball and he goes flying*
Dragonite:	yes you do
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't have time for this
Deino Mite:	*Rage within me, manifest and burn bright! FIREBALL!*
Dragonite:	if this was real bella would have slain you before you even took half a step
superheronerd:	_sighs_
SuperGummying:	No if this was real I probably be behind Bella even faster
Deino Mite:	but since it isnt real, i can cast magic and blast gummy off like team rocket
Deino Mite:	if it were real, gummy would lose even harder
KingofZeal:	Only thing gummy knows how to do is hide behind you Bella, lol
SuperGummying:	If this was real things would be different
Deino Mite:	^
Dragonite:	daily reminder that gummy sucks at role playing
SuperGummying:	Same with you though....
superheronerd:	So. Do something.
superheronerd:	In all realness, it is pretend. So you could do whatever you wanted.
SuperGummying:	Bella are you going to do something about this?
superheronerd:	Specificity is key.
Dragonite:	_gives gummy a wrench to blow his nose on_
SuperGummying:	*starts crying behind bella*
SuperGummying:	....
Dragonite:	he said he broke down
Aqua033:	y tho
Dragonite:	_calls a mechanic_
SuperGummying:	*starts to breakdown behind bella*
Dragonite:	i didnt say she couldnt have it back, i just stated that i beat gummy over the head with it
SuperGummying:	You gotta protect me
superheronerd:	_takes it back_
SuperGummying:	Bella look what he did
superheronerd:	Hey! I earned that badge
SuperGummying:	He's hurting me
SuperGummying:	Help me
Aqua033:	Nah
SuperGummying:	HELPPPPP
Aqua033:	~~Harder daddy~~ <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	That hurts 😭
SuperGummying:	Noooo
Dragonite:	_chucks bella's hearthstone badge at gummy's head_
Aqua033:	Oh.
SuperGummying:	*stays behind bella*
Dragonite:	his mind is rather fragile
SuperGummying:	He is terrorizing me
Aqua033:	I'm literally standing here on my phone how the hell is that hurting you
SuperGummying:	He's hurting me
SuperGummying:	Now save me
Aqua033:	Yeah
SuperGummying:	Yes
superheronerd:	Ok but have you guys seen my sick hearthstone badge?
SuperGummying:	Help
SuperGummying:	Bella he's hurting me
Aqua033:	Not really, no.
SuperGummying:	No I win
Aqua033:	~~Sounds like every experience I've ever had in PE~~
Aqua033:	Aqua wins by doing absolutely nothing
SuperGummying:	Right?
SuperGummying:	Bella is going to do something
SuperGummying:	No
Dragonite:	_awards a trophy to aqua for doing nothing_
Dragonite:	aaaaaaaaaand that is a forfeit on behalf of gummy
Aqua033:	Pathetic.
SuperGummying:	*runs and hides behind Bella*
Aqua033:	*fights*
SuperGummying:	Fight me
Aqua033:	Of course I'm mean!
VortexOA:	hello
Dragonite:	i'm trying to be helpful
SuperGummying:	You guys are mean
SuperGummying:	......
Aqua033:	^
Deino Mite:	gummy, dont think of it as embarrassing. think of it as an achievement that you had 3 girls touching you at once <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
superheronerd:	Have a good trip <@127474202520453120> (:
willofd2011:	Lol
Dragonite:	do that every day for about a month and you should be good
Dragonite:	_stuffs a bunch of lard down gummy's throat_
SuperGummying:	I'm not telling you that I got carried by three girls to the main school entrance without them even being tired from carrying me
Dragonite:	what you do now
SuperGummying:	Sooo embarrassing
Divexz:	I'll be off the grid til July 4th
Divexz:	I'm off for a trip
Dragonite:	yes
Deino Mite:	wait, who's anthony?
Deino Mite:	its gone
Luckyskarm:	*pings Deci*
Dragonite:	seriously, delete that before someone of importance sees it, that's how anthony bot the boot
Dragonite:	-rage
Deino Mite:	like that? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Luckyskarm:	if only people could be civil nobody would be banned
Luckyskarm:	^
Dragonite:	obviously if someone has the capacity to be civilized i'll let them off with a warning or something but when people join and immediately start posting copypasta walls, nobody has time for that
Dragonite:	i'm the one who puts on kicking boots at a moment's notice
Luckyskarm:	I don't like banning but i mean we can't be nice forever
willofd2011:	That's a lot of bans lol
Dragonite:	and counting
Dragonite:	ban count:
willofd2011:	Lol hey at least it worked XD
Deino Mite:	lol
Luckyskarm:	seems all it took was one ban to shut everyone up

Master9000:	**********************************************______________________________________________
Master9000:	******************************************
Dragonite:	that's like saying poking a tyrannosaurus in the eyeball is fun
SuperGummying:	but provoking ida and rainy is fun
Master9000:	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
superheronerd:	Rainy wouldn't totally wreck you
superheronerd:	So if you stop doing that to yourself
Master9000:	^
superheronerd:	Need I relay that you did this to yourself
Master9000:	She also doesn't want to get hurt
SuperGummying:	you wouldn't want to watch rainy and ida break me in half
SuperGummying:	you wouldn't want to watch me get hurt would you?
SuperGummying:	but but bestie i need protection
superheronerd:	Not how it works friendo
SuperGummying:	bella i offer it for you
SuperGummying:	subdivisions?
Kireina:	^^
superheronerd:	I did not offer this.
SuperGummying:	?
Master9000:	Gummy stop trying to make subdivisions
Kireina:	...
SuperGummying:	i also have will as a backup
Dragonite:	now he's just playing with it
SuperGummying:	don't worry bella will protect me from rainy and ida
Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	f u c k i n g mee6
Dragonite:	they rarely spend time in my skull these days
Dragonite:	i roll my eyes enough at gummy as it is
Dragonite:	come on, master
SuperGummying:	than use truck
SuperGummying:	if you guys don't wanna censor the f word
Dragonite:	i like how master is pretty much the only person the bot calls on language
Dragonite:	_slaps mee6_
Master9000:	Ducking autocorrect
Dragonite:	mutilate your corpse
Master9000:	Kill em again
SuperGummying:	what is ida going to do?

Dragonite:	also she's going to have a crap ton of pings when she gets back lol
Master9000:	Doit
Dragonite:	_looks at the printscreen key . . ._
Master9000:	<@!141255588846895105> gummy is misusing the term incest very severely
SuperGummying:	hey ida isn't here to see my grammar so gummy good
Master9000:	Oof
superheronerd:	Syntax is important
Dragonite:	it's like saying "the tin can ran a marathon"
Dragonite:	it most likely wouldn't have triggered a grammer checker but it doesn't make logical sense to say "i am a thing that people do"
Master9000:	Or a relation
Master9000:	You're not an action
Master9000:	The way you used it still isn't right
SuperGummying:	and im the emperor of france
Dragonite:	and im the king of persia
SuperGummying:	yes i did
Master9000:	No you didn't
SuperGummying:	i made dragonite say it
SuperGummying:	nah it was me
SuperGummying:	with logic
Master9000:	Not by you ofc
SuperGummying:	outsmarted master
SuperGummying:	ha
Master9000:	Nvm
Dragonite:	incest can be a noun
Dragonite:	incestous is the adjective

SuperGummying:	Ida are you in a bad mood or something?
regal swan:	maybe i dunno i hve little sleep why u asking me stuff?

Neon Strike Kitty:	Maybe because Gummy kept interrupting
SuperGummying:	^

SuperGummying:	I didn't invade anything
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's rude
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, stop invading conversations
SuperGummying:	Dragonite and master thank god you weren't in most of the call

Luckyskarm:	we didn't talk about taxes
Luckyskarm:	Cadance never does apparently
Master9000:	I always do
Luckyskarm:	We talked about using protection for a while.
Luckyskarm:	right
Master9000:	So you were saying
Luckyskarm:	walked over my keyoard
Master9000:	Oof
Luckyskarm:	lmao, my cat
Master9000:	What
Master9000:	What's the next thing on the list tho
Luckyskarm:	everything Darth
Master9000:	Could be worse
regal swan:	i williung to help after 9 if u dont care about webcam mic
Master9000:	What else do we still need to expose gummy to?
Master9000:	Oh good job
Luckyskarm:	He just kinda came on, but it was after i "texted" him so i'd like to think i summoned him XDD
Master9000:	How did you manage to get deci to be active?
Master9000:	Yeah nothing I wasn't already aware of lol
Luckyskarm:	OH, and a bunch of peoples irl names were said
Luckyskarm:	That's really all tho, Deci talked on VC for a long time is what i'd call the win of the night imo
Dragonite:	that's kind of a bad excuse
Master9000:	Yeah there could be a few innocent kids here from ss
Luckyskarm:	Cadance is always like that tho
Dragonite:	would not advise doing that again
Dragonite:	im going to be honest, looking through the logs, <@!140627136900759552> /was/ being kind of inappropriate
Master9000:	She was ok with cadance tho lol
Luckyskarm:	Bella was pretty creeped out that gummy wanted her in a swimsuit
Master9000:	No comment
Luckyskarm:	Cadance also called me easy. told him to f*ck off
Master9000:	Who can get it done to tragic news articles faster?
Dragonite:	no comment
Luckyskarm:	Cadance was like "bish please."
Master9000:	How do we measure or prove that
Luckyskarm:	Gummy also claimed he was more dirty then Cadance
Master9000:	I'd say that's kinda close to dark mage
Master9000:	Well the sodium supplier position is still available <@!304445424503226368>
Luckyskarm:	He said he claims dark mage
Master9000:	Oh shit
Luckyskarm:	OH btw Deci is pissed he's not on the Royal Hunting Party
Master9000:	So everyone except the royal family was there?
Luckyskarm:	Deci laughed hard at our text messages when he red them
Master9000:	I feel like when Eyan completes the server setup someday, rainy is gonna be Schala
Dragonite:	i did not need to know that
Luckyskarm:	Cadance also got salty tho cause rainy wouldn't bang him XD
Master9000:	Probably
Dragonite:	i've probably flushed him down the toilet more than the rest of you lot have killed him combined
Master9000:	But ida and I have both already killed him a couple dozen times each
Luckyskarm:	Ida will probably join in too
Dragonite:	only rainy?
Luckyskarm:	Oh yeah, Rainy is gonna kill gummy
Master9000:	He should've been more descriptive of his urges <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Dragonite:	_dumps a can of paint on gummy's username_
Luckyskarm:	Gummy is still blue btw
regal swan:	would webcam mic work
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137> glad I brought a headset
regal swan:	i really just too scared to talk on vc
Luckyskarm:	then we just started talking about rim jobs, pearl neckleces, etc etc
Master9000:	There needs to be an app that records that happens in all the voice chats
regal swan:	uk i really glad i stay out of vc
Dragonite:	of course he would
Luckyskarm:	But Deci got real pissy that Gummy didn't know what "giving head" was
Master9000:	If you're into that dragonite
Luckyskarm:	there's that too
Master9000:	Oh I thought it all started when he called himself an incest
Dragonite:	im temted to make a joke about beheadings right about now
Luckyskarm:	and it all started when gummy didn't know what "giving head" was
Master9000:	Ok good
Master9000:	Rainy and cadance took care of that tho right?
Luckyskarm:	Cadance did it for you
regal swan:	lol
Master9000:	Aww I wasn't there to demonstrate
Luckyskarm:	lots and lots of sex ed
Luckyskarm:	Sex ed
Master9000:	What happened in there?
Luckyskarm:	Yesterdays VC was something
Master9000:	Very carefully
Dragonite:	how did i survive
Dragonite:	i didnt really discover the internet until i was like fifteen
regal swan:	lol
Master9000:	Oh I just wandered too deep into the internets
Dragonite:	:^ )
Dragonite:	my mom gave me a book about growing up when i was like twelve
Master9000:	At 17 >_>
Dragonite:	in about seven or eight different forms
Dragonite:	the most important takeaway is that gummy has lost his innocence
regal swan:	still watching gordon ramasy btw
Master9000:	So cadance is no longer fertile, rainy costs $500 and gummy is an incest is what we learned from last night
regal swan:	lol
Master9000:	I'm only upset because I missed out on the fun
Master9000:	I liked it
Dragonite:	why would you do that to yourself
Master9000:	I just read thru it all...
Master9000:	How many people were also in voice chat last night?
Master9000:	1250 messages holy shit
Zaranius:	It's good stuff
Dragonite:	_pokes tuna pasta_
Zaranius:	MY MUM MADE TUNA PASTA
Dragonite:	_slaps AnimalMan with the temperature_
Animal_Glue_:	*reminds dragonite you can't really do that*

Deino Mite:	I'm surprised you have one.
SuperGummying:	and only so far
SuperGummying:	my first penta kill

Deino Mite:	That game is from 2 years ago!
SuperGummying:	http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1842004407/206790936?tab=overview

Neon Strike Kitty:	brb work
Deino Mite:	Ya that too
Deino Mite:	At least the school stuff.
Master9000:	You see mistakes everywhere in gummy's messages
SuperGummying:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's like having crippling depression
Deino Mite:	It makes life feel easy.
Master9000:	Here's how it feels
superheronerd:	What's it like being smart, guys?
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
Deino Mite:	I actually am making it in Java class because I finish all my projects so fast I have a ton of extra time.
Dragonite:	tee hee hee
Master9000:	Also stuff being legal is a separate rule
SuperGummying:	*points at bella*
SuperGummying:	ask bella
SuperGummying:	ask um
Deino Mite:	And has the simplest AI.
SuperGummying:	yes i do
Dragonite:	:^)
Deino Mite:	Cus it's the original.
Dragonite:	and i have a feeling you dont, gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	So if I create a Fire Emblem hack, can I share that?
Dragonite:	of all the games, why would you want to clone Red
SuperGummying:	i put in hours as well
SuperGummying:	dragonite
Deino Mite:	So if I made a dumbed down version of Pokemon red in Java, I could share that?
VortexOA:	and yeah i put over 20 hours into this song <@137336478291329024>
VortexOA:	alrighty
Master9000:	There's a difference between Gummy's self promotion of every video that nobody cares about and sharing stuff that you create like a brand new song or something else you actually create
Dragonite:	that's because vortex puts actual hours of work into the stuff he makes
superheronerd:	Ooh can you pm me it then?
SuperGummying:	yeah i can't self promote
SuperGummying:	^
VortexOA:	but that would count as self-promotion
Master9000:	You can still share stuff you create <@250127163049639937>
Luckyskarm:	**Lucky has stabbed Dragonite so many time his face is unrecognizable and his body is gushing so much blood its like a fountain**

SuperGummying:	So much for you hiding behind me lol
superheronerd:	Lol
SuperGummying:	I said imma feed the goose as well but I'll be behind you in case if the goose attacks I can throw you at it
Kireina:	yes
superheronerd:	What
SuperGummying:	I'm so mean to you
SuperGummying:	Sorry Bella
cadance:	Granted that's kind of a Christmas thing but it'd be good any time of year
superheronerd:	It more so is demanding food, so maybe it'll be suffice to just have it not hiss at me
cadance:	Serve the goose with a nice fennel salad, peas and carrots, maybe some sweet potatoes, add in a nice Pinot Noir to drink
SuperGummying:	And I need to throw something at it
SuperGummying:	Just in case it's attack
SuperGummying:	I'll be behind you though
Animal_Glue_:	be careful it may like you too much
SuperGummying:	Can I feed as well?
superheronerd:	Maybe it'll like me after I feed it
SuperGummying:	How did I do?
SuperGummying:	I tried to act tough though
cadance:	No reason to be afraid of a goose, they're pretty good for dinner
SuperGummying:	So yeah I can't act tough 😭
SuperGummying:	I'll probably run
SuperGummying:	You know
superheronerd:	Doom goose
willofd2011:	Lol
Animal_Glue_:	tha goose of doom
SuperGummying:	I see them too often
SuperGummying:	Like I said you can hide behind me I'm not scared of them
willofd2011:	*does the same* lol
superheronerd:	_watches everyone get chased by a goose_
SuperGummying:	Who wants to beat me up...
SuperGummying:	You are tell me it's bad that you put me at risk at a geese rather than me putting you at risk for everyone else here
cadance:	Again I ain't afraid of no goose
superheronerd:	O:
Kireina:	😦
superheronerd:	They're mean
Kireina:	They so mean
Kireina:	Canadian Geese are scary.
superheronerd:	They are!
superheronerd:	That'd just be senseless
Kireina:	idk
superheronerd:	It's a goose
SuperGummying:	It's time for me to return the favour
SuperGummying:	Because I put you at risk all the time
cadance:	I ain't afraid of no goose
superheronerd:	You gotta run from that sucker lmao
superheronerd:	Why would I put you at risk to a goose
SuperGummying:	You can hide behind me
SuperGummying:	Don't worry Bella
superheronerd:	And he makes me slightly nervous to walk to the pool
superheronerd:	It's a hissing goose
superheronerd:	The goose and ducks are always together
Master9000:	The ducks just need to team up with you to get the goose tf out
Master9000:	Lmao
superheronerd:	Gross
superheronerd:	The connection out here is kinda
superheronerd:	
superheronerd:	It's uploading 👍🏼

Master9000:	Can't waste the good stuff on those quacks
superheronerd:	The goose will get the inferior breads
Master9000:	*sends Bella a barrel full of other inferior types of bread*
Aqua033:	
Master9000:	Oh and for the ducks
superheronerd:	To fend off ducks
superheronerd:	I will make good use
superheronerd:	Thank you
Master9000:	*sends Bella Italian bread*
superheronerd:	It was the goose
Master9000:	Uh oh
superheronerd:	If i do not return
superheronerd:	Wee woo wee woo the ducks are demanding payment in food
Master9000:	I have a few old friends on there who hooked me back in with the new update

SuperGummying:	master you are on it
SuperGummying:	mine says kiddie aquard
Dragonite:	also gross, they changed how the feature box looks again and it's awful
Master9000:	But why not just go with base 128 at that point
Dragonite:	because my featured channels box is subtitled "interesting people"
Master9000:	What is there to feature?
SuperGummying:	explain to me why im not in feature channels again?
Dragonite:	he should do a YouTube and code name all of his plans in eleven digits of base 64
SuperGummying:	dragonite
Master9000:	He's gonna have to resort to 80-digit hexadecimal by the end of the year
SuperGummying:	yeah i know
Dragonite:	you're going to run out of letters
SuperGummying:	you said your pc blew up last time you stream
SuperGummying:	imma see if streaming works
SuperGummying:	imma attempt plan t
SuperGummying:	oh dragonite
Dragonite:	but it sounds like he can't swim so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
superheronerd:	Brb
Dragonite:	i mean, he could just swim out since the portals are underwater
superheronerd:	That isn't possible
superheronerd:	You're literally stuck
SuperGummying:	Now you're stuck as well
SuperGummying:	*pulls Bella in*
superheronerd:	You're pretty stuck
superheronerd:	Have you seen portal?

SuperGummying:	I'll clean your room for like a month
SuperGummying:	Bella helpppppp
Master9000:	*watches gummy get torn apart by portal physics*
SuperGummying:	*screams for Bella to help*
superheronerd:	Ooh! Portal gun
willofd2011:	XD
Dragonite:	_takes a portal gun and creates a portal on the floor and side of the pool so gummy is in a perpetual state of falling in and out of the pool without end_
Master9000:	*creates a quantum oof*
SuperGummying:	Bella don't leave me I'm like drowning
SuperGummying:	*starts drowning*
willofd2011:	Lol

SuperGummying:	Now time to build a time machine
SuperGummying:	The was an awesome video
SuperGummying:	Btw master
SuperGummying:	Idc I'll jump into a pool if that was how I was going to get protected
SuperGummying:	Bella you didn't see that
superheronerd:	_becomes water bender_
willofd2011:	Lol
superheronerd:	Will do
Master9000:	Thank me later
Master9000:	*summons bubble of water around bella*
willofd2011:	I guess so lol
superheronerd:	All I need to do is be in a pool?
superheronerd:	To avoid the being a human shield
superheronerd:	So you're saying
SuperGummying:	But so far I hid behind Bella, night shade, regal, will, and ida
SuperGummying:	Though you guys weren't around yesterday
SuperGummying:	Hmmm
Master9000:	*starts putting interest rates on the 155 gummy owes him*
Dragonite:	gummy is in a perpetual state of ripping people off, would not recommend doing business with him
Master9000:	I take pay
SuperGummying:	Bella doesn't take pay so I don't pay you
SuperGummying:	Wait no
SuperGummying:	Bella wouldn't hurt me
regal swan:	i still need payment from yesterday tho
regal swan:	i protect u
willofd2011:	Yes <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	She beats you up I think
SuperGummying:	🤔
SuperGummying:	If she was in the pool do I go in to hide behind her or get beat up?
SuperGummying:	Wait I got a question
SuperGummying:	*hides behind bella*
Master9000:	Oof
Dragonite:	_beats Gummy up all the same_
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you went to Ireland?
Dragonite:	oh okay
Master9000:	*pops the [weeb term exempt] and pokes the needle at dragonites finger* no
SuperGummying:	Yes Dragonite the master plan was to make sure you stop beating me up by saying I want to to
Dragonite:	so that's a thing
Dragonite:	my brother's apparent favorite part of being in Ireland was petting sheep
Dragonite:	oh, one more thing before you go
Neon Strike Kitty:	brb work
Dragonite:	_slaps Master around a bit with a large waifu_
Master9000:	I think that's out of age range for both of you
Neon Strike Kitty:	*backs away faster*
Master9000:	Oof
SuperGummying:	11
Zaranius:	Just mute the kid thats what I did
Master9000:	How old is Lillie?
Dragonite:	that was his master plan all along, wasnt it
Dragonite:	the funny thing is, beating up gummy sounds a lot less exciting now that i know he wants me to
SuperGummying:	*hugs ida*
SuperGummying:	Ida nooo im nice see
SuperGummying:	I mean sure I'll keep Lillie to myself
Neon Strike Kitty:	*backs away from Gummy*
SuperGummying:	....Dragonite not the point
Master9000:	Oof
Dragonite:	keep your fetishes to yourself
SuperGummying:	But now I guess Dragonite would have to do it
SuperGummying:	Tbh I wanted her to beat me up for real
Dragonite:	but flipping tables can be so invogorating
SuperGummying:	She lost interest in being violent
SuperGummying:	Ida is right
Master9000:	Wait nvm they wore sandals or something in those times
Master9000:	You mean a titan's sock?
cadance:	I mean a sleeping bag is basically just a giant sock
Master9000:	Just stitch the socks together
Master9000:	Oof
Dragonite:	_stuffs entire body into a sock in the absence of blankets and pillows_
Neon Strike Kitty:	*knits Dragonite more socks with sheep on them*
regal swan:	weird early
regal swan:	weirdearly dinner was ok
Dragonite:	this is your opportunity to flip tables at me
Dragonite:	also ida for some reason i now possess socks with sheep on them
Aqua033:	A lot.
Dragonite:	do they have stats on how many individual users WoW has?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Honestly with a game like WoW I'm surprised that not every name in existence has been taken
SuperGummying:	I'm making a trip to your house
SuperGummying:	Dragonite
Dragonite:	there's a lot of moving parts but i wouldn't want to be in the same time zone as either of them
Dragonite:	i'd say gummy's interesting about the same way an atomic bomb is interesting
SuperGummying:	Omg this video is interesting
Master9000:	But what about the droid attacks on the Wookiee?
SuperGummying:	And number three imma watch that
Deino Mite:	thats a curve that resembles a figure 8
Deino Mite:	what about lemniscate
SuperGummying:	Number two Dragonite did you say I was interesting
SuperGummying:	Number one Bella you wanna do the vacuum cleaner for me than <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Wait wait
Master9000:	That's what I imagine gummy would be like at a waterpark
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	Skip to 5:18 in this https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=042_1357516325
Deino Mite:	thats a 20 sided 3d solid
Dragonite:	too long
Deino Mite:	i could name it Icosahedron
Deino Mite:	WoW
Neon Strike Kitty:	What are you playing?
Deino Mite:	i wanted to do Tesseract, but it's taken
Dragonite:	call it "integral," because presumably it'll be that to your team
Deino Mite:	so i cant do vector
Deino Mite:	its a female
SuperGummying:	Oh soooo I may die?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Vector?
superheronerd:	Electrocution is a thing _finger guns_
Deino Mite:	anyone have a good name for an elf mage that is a math term
superheronerd:	Firstly
Dragonite:	have fun with that
superheronerd:	No
SuperGummying:	That's why imma suck up the water with a vacuum cleaner
SuperGummying:	I know
superheronerd:	You don't like water
SuperGummying:	Can I come to the pool with you?
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're legit a spammer
Dragonite:	because when gummy talks he at least talks about semi-interesting stuff
SuperGummying:	Bella
Neon Strike Kitty:	Master's ahead because he has access to the staff channel and he was here setting things up
superheronerd:	I'm making them rice
Neon Strike Kitty:	But Gummy violates rule 1 by default <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
superheronerd:	The goose and ducks were back
SuperGummying:	He is higher on the list than me
SuperGummying:	He spams as well
SuperGummying:	Ida how is this different from master?
Deino Mite:	dang it. tesseract is taken
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh wait, there is
Neon Strike Kitty:	There should be a rule against spam
SuperGummying:	That way I can get ahead of master
SuperGummying:	And I won't talk but type
SuperGummying:	Tonight you guys talk to me
SuperGummying:	That's what I meant as test dummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	*watches you fail*
SuperGummying:	Who ever is around in voice chat tonight can help
SuperGummying:	Watch
SuperGummying:	Ida imma hit it before him
SuperGummying:	Yes mother I know

Deino Mite:	since that was the name of the elf in sword art online progressive
Deino Mite:	i might name it Kizmel
regal swan:	sigh gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	and you need to have the line with only the command
PKMN03:	Oh lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's the right command, wrong channel
PKMN03:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
PKMN03:	Name him DireWolf
Deino Mite:	i need a name for my elf mage
SuperGummying:	Imma suck all the water up with a vacuum cleaner
SuperGummying:	That's why when Bella takes me there
PKMN03:	Or is that the wrong command?

Master9000:	Yeah that's what I thought
willofd2011:	Hi deci lol ^w^
Deci:	dunno, probably the fact that ther'es only 1 chancellor, so having "supreme" is redundant
Master9000:	<@&305454623869632515> what's the difference between chancellor and supreme chancellor?
regal swan:	lol

Master9000:	You got this
Master9000:	Lmao

Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **superheronerd leveled up!**
superheronerd:	_tries to avoid ulterior motives_
regal swan:	can we have a day without violence/evil plots?

regal swan:	mayo is satan
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	Parents just love to add it tho
Master9000:	That's why I minimize it as much as I can
cadance:	Mayo is literally the work of Satan
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
Master9000:	It's a salad of pickles, kalbasa boiled eggs, and boiled potatoes (some people also add peas) sliced up into 1/8 in pieces
willofd2011:	Sounds good lol ^w^
Master9000:	I personally recommend the "olivie" Russian dish for mixing with cookies, it's amazing
superheronerd:	Very noble.
willofd2011:	Maybe lol
Master9000:	Will do you mix salads into your cookies just for dragonite to stay alive?
willofd2011:	*gives food to dragonite* lol
Dragonite:	brb
Dragonite:	_flops off for food_
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137> get that food
superheronerd:	Hope you eat soon ):
Dragonite:	_flops down the road_
Dragonite:	there's a quick chek about three miles down the road
Master9000:	What's the nearest place to eat for you dragonite
superheronerd:	Weirdly similar situation. I woke up at 4:30 and lunch kind of just. Hit me over the head
Dragonite:	_dies of food_
Dragonite:	i've had exactly not much food since 7 AM in GMT+0
Master9000:	I've been eating pringles for hours now
Dragonite:	food sounds pretty good right about now
superheronerd:	I ate before I slept. Pretty sure that was a food coma
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	My dad is grilling something and I'm starting to smell it
Dragonite:	swimming is gross
superheronerd:	Now, anyway, water reminds me of the pool trip I need to make
Dragonite:	people aren't obligated to reply through PMs
Master9000:	Because you're acting immature
SuperGummying:	Than tell him to reply to me
superheronerd:	And this really not is the place to talk about it
SuperGummying:	Than why are you acting like I'm a huge joke
superheronerd:	As a witness to that whole thing, you need to let it go
Master9000:	It's not a joke
SuperGummying:	And he thinks it's a joke
SuperGummying:	So I'm letting everyone know that he's actually hurting me for once
superheronerd:	I would be more interested in making small talk about weather. Which we were doing
SuperGummying:	Because he won't reply to me in pm
superheronerd:	And you're prolonging the issue in the wrong place
SuperGummying:	And he's actually being a jerk about it this time
Master9000:	Ok gummy no more messages about Camelot here
Dragonite:	don't cross people with the kicking boots
SuperGummying:	He basically just ruin what I made
Dragonite:	master has the kicking boots, remember
SuperGummying:	Bella did you not know what he just did
Master9000:	Yeah
superheronerd:	Can you not do that here.
Master9000:	Welcome to the new age
SuperGummying:	This would be one of them
SuperGummying:	Master you know me well enough to know I never let things go
Master9000:	Sounds a bit short on water
superheronerd:	The desert was pretty nice too 😁
Master9000:	The lakeside weather was great today
Master9000:	Oh right
Dragonite:	weather
superheronerd:	Goodness
Master9000:	Ok so where were we?
Master9000:	Thnx
SuperGummying:	Alright fine I'll just do this in pm
Master9000:	Ok that's enough gummy
SuperGummying:	He stole it
SuperGummying:	No it's not gone
Master9000:	It doesn't take ownership to access an old text
Dragonite:	tough beans
Dragonite:	now it's gone
Dragonite:	you declined to do anything with that, too
Dragonite:	you had half a year where you were owner
SuperGummying:	Yes I do
Master9000:	No you don't
Master9000:	It's just out of his view so he'll drop the subject
SuperGummying:	No I needed ownership to access them all
Dragonite:	tough beans
Dragonite:	now it's gone
Dragonite:	you declined to do so
Dragonite:	you had like three weeks to grep it
Master9000:	Like what
SuperGummying:	Do you not realize you just made me lose so many stuff on there that I need
SuperGummying:	Hi Bella
Master9000:	Hi bella
superheronerd:	Hello friends.
SuperGummying:	So thanks a lot
SuperGummying:	That I need
superheronerd:	I just had a lovely nap
SuperGummying:	Plus I still have stuff on there
SuperGummying:	I was going to remove all of you and than delete it
SuperGummying:	But the chat does
SuperGummying:	Yeah it doesn't
Master9000:	The community doesn't belong to you
SuperGummying:	And I was robbed
SuperGummying:	Imma assume you would never drop it
Dragonite:	all right, real talk: this is exactly what we mean when we say gummy's not mature enough to be leader
SuperGummying:	If you were robbed
SuperGummying:	No until you give me back what belongs to me
SuperGummying:	Why you seriously
Master9000:	Drop the subject gummy
SuperGummying:	I knew I should of gave it to Bella when I had a chance
Master9000:	Of what
SuperGummying:	He just wants the power
SuperGummying:	Because
Master9000:	Lol
Dragonite:	irelandland
SuperGummying:	And than kicks me
Dragonite:	and the weather is nice for once
Master9000:	Where have u been?
SuperGummying:	He steals ownership
Dragonite:	im finally back in the armpit of america after a week away
SuperGummying:	Do you guys not see the issue here
SuperGummying:	And you kick me from it again
Master9000:	Lakeside house is awesome
SuperGummying:	You stole my own chat that I work so hard to built
Master9000:	Beautiful
willofd2011:	That was a waste of a cookie
Dragonite:	so master, how's the weather?
SuperGummying:	No
Master9000:	He's gonna run out of steam eventually just ignore it
Dragonite:	that was so satisfying
Dragonite:	i just saw it poof out of existence
SuperGummying:	Was going to make me drop it
willofd2011:	D:
SuperGummying:	Do you think kicking me
Dragonite:	_takes cookie and chucks it at Gummy_
Master9000:	You can drop the subject now gummy
SuperGummying:	What did you do?
willofd2011:	*noms on a cookie*
Master9000:	There we go problem solved
Dragonite:	gratias
SuperGummying:	Now I'm never going to drop it
Dragonite:	(･ω･)
SuperGummying:	Give it back or I'm never going to drop it
Master9000:	Ok just gonna fix this so gummy will drop it
willofd2011:	Everything happened lol
SuperGummying:	I can't delete it if he won't give it back
SuperGummying:	But he won't give it back
Luckyskarm:	Alright, what happened?
SuperGummying:	I am going to delete it
Dragonite:	im tired of it taking up real estate in my discord sidebar
SuperGummying:	I'm asking you nicely so give it back
Dragonite:	just delete it already
Master9000:	No
SuperGummying:	Well I want it back
Dragonite:	_flings ಠ\_ಠs at Gummy_
Master9000:	I didn't steal it
SuperGummying:	And I want it back
SuperGummying:	You stole it from me remember
SuperGummying:	No I'm not until you give it back
willofd2011:	An enemy unit got a 1% crit but luckily I lived it lol
Master9000:	Drop the subject
SuperGummying:	The old chat
Master9000:	Of what
SuperGummying:	Ownership now
Master9000:	I do
SuperGummying:	Master ownership now
Dragonite:	
Dragonite:	this says hi:
SuperGummying:	Uhhh noooo
Master9000:	Oof
Dragonite:	two servers, in fact
Dragonite:	we have an entire server that suggests strongly to the contrary
SuperGummying:	Yeah I can
Master9000:	And then promptly get removed from power because you can't control it at all
SuperGummying:	Declare myself as Emperor
SuperGummying:	Coup
SuperGummying:	Okay plan b
willofd2011:	Lol
Dragonite:	dragonite currently googling: "can someone be impeached without actually holding office"
Master9000:	We already did that
Dragonite:	i wanna impeach Gummy
Master9000:	Ok. CONGRATULATIONS! Your approval ratings are currently at 20% at most and you're also running a broke state who has no money for new investments for progress now
Dragonite:	are we talking about impeaching Gummy now?
Dragonite:	ooh, politics
SuperGummying:	And try to lower the taxes
SuperGummying:	Ban weed even though Canada legalized it
SuperGummying:	Since people are losing jobs to them
SuperGummying:	In Canada I would idk stop with the whole refugee stuff
willofd2011:	Sounds like the complete opposite of helping people
Master9000:	How do u plan on helping people?
willofd2011:	^
Master9000:	Seems stupid
SuperGummying:	And declare war on places I hate
SuperGummying:	Nah I would help people
Master9000:	Same
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	For example gummy, he would try to make the national debt even bigger than it needs to be lmao
Master9000:	Maybe we are lucky that trump is president compared to some other options
Master9000:	You know
SuperGummying:	once again you are a strong pokemon
SuperGummying:	will
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	well im not stupid though......
Deino Mite:	Cus I hate seeing stupid people do dumb stuff. It's a reflex.
Deino Mite:	And cut the episode at all the conversations with her so you can get her in 2 parts instead of one.
SuperGummying:	don't you hate me?
SuperGummying:	why are you giving me advice?
Deino Mite:	Then just take the game super slow and get as many parts with Lillie as possible.
SuperGummying:	it doesn't matter who beats the game first
SuperGummying:	number of lillie thumbnails
superheronerd:	In terms of completion, I mean... you got work to do
Deino Mite:	Wait, are you going by % or number?
SuperGummying:	im half way
SuperGummying:	thats because he is almost done the game
Deino Mite:	Ya there's no way you win.
SuperGummying:	i have around 6.5
Deino Mite:	Judges give it a perfect 10
SuperGummying:	he has at least 10 lillie thumbnails
Animal_Glue_:	asumming that's true
SuperGummying:	he's winning
Deino Mite:	Oh wow! What an accomplishment! You should feel very proud of yourself!
SuperGummying:	sun and moon
Deino Mite:	In?
SuperGummying:	like beat dragonite
SuperGummying:	imma do stuff
SuperGummying:	well er
Animal_Glue_:	gg
SuperGummying:	....
Deino Mite:	More free time for us then.
Deino Mite:	Ok
SuperGummying:	i don't need your help than
Deino Mite:	Ya in having people over too.
Deino Mite:	Tell us or we won't help.
willofd2011:	But like I said last night I am having family coming over and stuff
SuperGummying:	can't tell you yet
SuperGummying:	er something
willofd2011:	I might lol
Deino Mite:	Test for what?
Deino Mite:	I will I think.
SuperGummying:	i need some test dummys
Deino Mite:	It's Java for an if else statement.
SuperGummying:	who is going to be around tonight?
superheronerd:	Code me to play it
superheronerd:	Ah yes of course
willofd2011:	*doesn't really get it but just goes with it* Lol XD
Deino Mite:	Here's a simple flow chart:
if( Has FE: Echoes == false) {
        buy FE: Echoes
        play it
} else play it
willofd2011:	You're welcome lol ^w^
superheronerd:	Thanks will haha
willofd2011:	*lends Bella her copy of echoes* lol
SuperGummying:	of course it's simple lol
SuperGummying:	*gives bella echoes*
superheronerd:	Lol it's not that simple, friendo.
willofd2011:	Le gasp D:
Deino Mite:	Go get it right now then.
superheronerd:	I do not have echoes still 💔
Deino Mite:	Btw, are there no axe users in Echoes cus I haven't gotten one yet, but I have an axe that had some really good combat stats.
willofd2011:	Yeah especially when you want to play fates as well cause it would explain a few certain things in the game lol
SuperGummying:	it's better
SuperGummying:	play Napoleon Total War
superheronerd:	It makes me sad that I can't contribute to this
Deino Mite:	I'd recommend awakening as its my favorite video game of all time, but you can really play any game in the franchise and get the hang of it.
willofd2011:	Like I started with playing awakening and I've been playing fire emblem since lol
Animal_Glue_:	maybe
willofd2011:	Any game in the series really lol
Deino Mite:	Maybe if Eyan plays it, it will convince other people to.
willofd2011:	^
Deino Mite:	You should play Fire Emblem then.
willofd2011:	Nice lol
Animal_Glue_:	I know nothing about that game
Deino Mite:	She is pretty over leveled though because of that. I think she's lvl 17 and the rest of my troops are around 12-13.
willofd2011:	Wow lol
Deino Mite:	I have Excalibur and Blessed Sword on Celica and she can basically take on anything the enemy throws at her.
willofd2011:	Lol
Zaranius:	Lmao
Zaranius:	Whelp i just spent about an hour editing a deck
willofd2011:	Yeah lol ^w^
Deino Mite:	Same with the blessed sword and the royal sword.
Deino Mite:	Excalibur is such a good spell though. You get so much crit chance off it.
willofd2011:	Yeah probably lol
Deino Mite:	I think you always hit if you get a crit.
Deino Mite:	And the AI accuracy is great. I had my Pegasus knight sitting in a forest and she died multiple times cus the enemy kept hitting 40-50% shots.
willofd2011:	At least you hit most if not all the time when you get a crit lol
Deino Mite:	Ya I crit more often that I hit stuff.
willofd2011:	Dang lol
Deino Mite:	It's not always enough though. I've had to soft reset multiple times cus I've ran out of Turnwheels for RNG insurance.
SuperGummying:	and will
willofd2011:	It's like you get more crits than actually hitting anything
SuperGummying:	i would play fire emblem tonight but i rather wait for both blitz and bella
Deino Mite:	Thank goodness Mila's Turnwheel exists.
Animal_Glue_:	lol
Deino Mite:	The amount of 80-90% shots I've missed is ridiculous.
willofd2011:	I think you mentioned it a few times and it is horrible lol
Deino Mite:	It sucks. A lot.
SuperGummying:	how is it so far pimaster?
SuperGummying:	no
Deino Mite:	Have I mentioned how stupid the accuracy system is in Fire Emblem Echoes?
superheronerd:	Nice 😁
willofd2011:	Lol
PKMN03:	😅
PKMN03:	One of the Spectrobes DS games
Animal_Glue_:	angry birds
superheronerd:	What was the game? <@163478072081907712>
SuperGummying:	get something expensive lol
SuperGummying:	why
PKMN03:	😂
PKMN03:	Welp I had looked in GameStop for like an hour
PKMN03:	Came out with a $0.99 game and a pack of trading cards
PKMN03:	Probably lol
Deino Mite:	Maybe they just sold out and haven't gotten any back in.
PKMN03:	Ugh
PKMN03:	**Why would you put something out on display if you don't have any more**
Deino Mite:	Lol
PKMN03:	*"Sorry sir we are all out"*
PKMN03:	We go to pay
PKMN03:	This GameStop had a case for Mario strikers charged on display
SuperGummying:	why
PKMN03:	I'm really pissed
PKMN03:	I'm not really jealous 😅
superheronerd:	That looks fun!
SuperGummying:	where are you again?
Aqua033:	That's a nice balcony.

SuperGummying:	Could it be idk a gun?
superheronerd:	Riiight
SuperGummying:	Now for you to figure out what it is 😛
SuperGummying:	Oh well plan c worked
SuperGummying:	Darn it I should of called her
superheronerd:	Well i mean she's a friend from high school. She's been there before haha
SuperGummying:	But I been dropping so many hints I'm surprised you don't know what it is
SuperGummying:	For me I try the same trick on you and it doesn't work
SuperGummying:	Hmmm interesting
superheronerd:	Dang it.
superheronerd:	Now I'm just
superheronerd:	And since she's staying over at my home for a bit this summer, I thought nothing of it
superheronerd:	And suddenly she asked me for my address
superheronerd:	It* the other day
superheronerd:	Because we were taking about I
SuperGummying:	How do you know though?
SuperGummying:	Well that wasn't that expensive so that's good for you
SuperGummying:	Oh lol
superheronerd:	So I think my friend bought me a 3ds charger that I've been needing
superheronerd:	What're you looking for?
superheronerd:	Not bad tho.
superheronerd:	Darn
PKMN03:	Never mind. There's not one close so I'll have to settle with GameStop 😂

superheronerd:	I know there's a PS3 version but it's just not as pretty
Kugallyblitz:	oh ya, and there aare some really cool people i meet along the way
superheronerd:	It looks amazing.
Kugallyblitz:	you can do so much crap in that game, the online side to it
Kugallyblitz:	gta v that is
Kugallyblitz:	gta is my top pick for multiplayer games
superheronerd:	Mm, sadly I've never played too many multiplayer games
Kugallyblitz:	no need for other games imo
Kugallyblitz:	I play gta and not some "family friendly" game with others cos we can have good laughs, and do stuff together, compete, abd make it our own. If i can do that for just 60 dollars im fine
superheronerd:	I think I've got gta 4 around here somewhere but idk
Kugallyblitz:	lol cool
superheronerd:	I have a ps2 copy, and I used to have it on my phone
Kugallyblitz:	san andreas was awesome
superheronerd:	I may have an LA bias. Shh.
superheronerd:	I'd love to play gta v. The last game I've played was San Andreas
Kugallyblitz:	i know gta may not be the best, but there are so many experiences you can have with someone IMO
superheronerd:	I want mine more for injustice, and a couple games coming next year
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think there's better games to play with people
superheronerd:	Awesome 😁
Kugallyblitz:	I play with my dad, and this guy we met who lives in arizona, hes cool, and sometimes on occasion play with a friend who i know irl
Kugallyblitz:	i play it for the sole purpose of playing with friends and the cooperation side of it
superheronerd:	Even though its based on my own city lol
superheronerd:	Sadly
superheronerd:	I have never played gta v
Kugallyblitz:	its fun
Kugallyblitz:	I sually play gta with friends
superheronerd:	You could play injustice o:
Kugallyblitz:	it's cool™
Kugallyblitz:	I got a ps4
superheronerd:	And I wanna work so I can get my ps4
superheronerd:	Even then, I work.
Kugallyblitz:	breaks sound relaxing
superheronerd:	Basically I won't have any real break until August

Kugallyblitz:	then I play it on my real drums later 😐
Kugallyblitz:	I actually know if I can get a fill right or not
Kugallyblitz:	instead of lifting up the sticks myself
Kugallyblitz:	I guess so I feel more rebound
Master9000:	I mean your thighs what is the snare in that
Master9000:	I know
Kugallyblitz:	it lies right between the drummer's legs
Kugallyblitz:	the snare drum is a drum in a drum set, the most hit drum...

Neon Strike Kitty:	Can I do it on my parents' internet?
Kireina:	and there are plenty of VPN's to use
Kireina:	In short it basically tells your network that you are in a different country

Master9000:	but yes deci
Master9000:	i already killed the enemy vayne
cadance:	Deci you realize I'm legally allowed to slap you for that right?
Deci:	he actually "Used a general ability available to all players on a high cooldown to teleport a short distance past the hitbox of a cone-shaped projectile so that he could kill 2 enemy players, otherwise he would have died"
superheronerd:	Nah. All good lol
SuperGummying:	bella want me to teach you league?

Master9000:	easy that time since i was 2 lvls up
Master9000:	lmao another 2v1 double kill
Neon Strike Kitty:	and then killed two enemies
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think what he means is he teleported himself through a projectile that would have killed him if it hit
Master9000:	ill send the clip after game lol
Master9000:	against another vayne and ashe
Animal_Glue_:	idk wut that means

SuperGummying:	i hmm that means i fell in love with war
cadance:	But that's because she doesn't feel the same about me
Animal_Glue_:	that's a good love I'd say
Animal_Glue_:	I fell in love with overwatch
SuperGummying:	take my advice

Neon Strike Kitty:	5 years might be expecting too much from Gummy
SuperGummying:	or caused trouble
SuperGummying:	they made me do english stuff but i climb out the window
Neon Strike Kitty:	but what I'd probably do would be making you do the same tasks over and over and over until after 5 years you finally get them right
SuperGummying:	and guess what i never leant anything
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't want to torture myself with that
SuperGummying:	i got remove from french class because my english was so weak in grade 8

NightShade:	I might actually get further in BOTW today 😄
KingofZeal:	In all fairness, I'm not cancelling it, it's just gonna only be a stream for the night crew cause that's the only time I can stream.
Master9000:	Big ol maybe
Master9000:	This just gives me time to maybe be productive for once
KingofZeal:	Sorry.  =\
Deino Mite:	Eyan, why you gotta cancel stream? I have a wake to go to tomorrow and it's gonna be super boring listening to people say "I'm sorry" for 4 hours. Now what am I supposed to watch?
Luckyskarm:	Gummy, what did you do?
cadance:	*sits in the corner*
cadance:	Okay
cadance:	Boo

Kugallyblitz:	I wouldn't say it is
Deino Mite:	fire emblem just takes precedence
Deino Mite:	no
superheronerd:	Is that forfeiting it
superheronerd:	<@199725993416589313> wants to see if he's better than me at injustice 2. So I told him to to beat the current story mode, but he won't do it before the fire emblem thing

willofd2011:	Hmm?
SuperGummying:	I got a question
SuperGummying:	Will
KingofZeal:	And I envision him as master of magic period more or less
Deino Mite:	im the last pi master, master of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus
KingofZeal:	I mean, I personally have my own vision for what I'd imagine him to be
Master9000:	you should be master of all 4 elements <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Master9000:	hmm, shadow
Master9000:	*checks eyan's rules*
Deino Mite:	ida might be willing to give you necromancer and take archer
KingofZeal:	But he also has earth attacks and healing spells mixed in
Master9000:	wtf summoner and necromancer are considered the same role <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
KingofZeal:	But the fan game mostly had him utilize fire magic
Deino Mite:	those are the standard classes in an rpg
KingofZeal:	I mean, I would assume he could realistically use any magic
Deino Mite:	each class from a standard rpg style game
Master9000:	is he capable of necromancy?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Each class from what?
Master9000:	im not darius irl lol
KingofZeal:	I completely forgot he was capable of healing magic
Deino Mite:	cus we need balance
Deino Mite:	one of each class in our party
Master9000:	why not
Deino Mite:	no
Master9000:	we can have multiple assassins
Master9000:	where did u find that
willofd2011:	^
Deino Mite:	will is an assassin
KingofZeal:	King Zeal actually does use healing magic
Deino Mite:	ya
SuperGummying:	Pimaster are you ready to hunt yet?
Master9000:	is assassin taken?
KingofZeal:	Oh shit
Deino Mite:	paladin might be good for him
Deino Mite:	you are a necromancer.  we need a class for master
Neon Strike Kitty:	Paladin?
Deino Mite:	we need one of each class
Deino Mite:	you are in, but what class are you
SuperGummying:	I'm under Bella's bed if you want to find me
Master9000:	was i not a founding member already?
SuperGummying:	Who are you hunting?

willofd2011:	Mhm lol ^w^
Deino Mite:	will, you are the assassin, right?
Deino Mite:	open classes are: paladin, fighter, monk, berzerker, archer
willofd2011:	Fine *Mila's Turnwheel to turn back time to the point before she blew up the door and doesn't do that again* there lol
Deino Mite:	but shiroe also has some pretty strong offensive spells
Neon Strike Kitty:	I meant to read the LN
Deino Mite:	kinda
Neon Strike Kitty:	An Enchanter?
Deino Mite:	so then archer is still open
Neon Strike Kitty:	I watched it
Deino Mite:	did you ever watch log horizon? i like being a mage like shiroe from there
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	so I think necromancer would work for me
KingofZeal:	So I suppose I can be marked as priest
Neon Strike Kitty:	I raise the dead irl
Deino Mite:	open classes are: paladin, fighter, berzerker, monk,priest, and necromancer
KingofZeal:	Realistically, I actually prefer role of a priest/healer as I command everybody
SuperGummying:	No fire emblem will
Deino Mite:	we already have a mage, an assassin, and an archer
Master9000:	and he didnt actually give it to himself yet because  eyan still hasnt connected patreon <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Deino Mite:	these are the classes in a party
willofd2011:	*will replace it later*
Deino Mite:	Warrior / Fighter: The melee hack-and-slash class that is often the hero of the game.
Knight / Paladin: A class clad in heavy armor, made to absorb all that enemies dish out.
Barbarian / Berzerker: The big guy with an equally big weapon, used to smash enemies.
Monk / Martial Artist: A melee class that forgoes weapons for their powerful fists and martial arts.
Archer / Ranger: The ranged class with bows or guns. This role can also be taken by the Rogue or Hunter classes.
Thief / Rogue / Assassin: The sneaky bandit with itchy fingers and a nose for treasure, and wields a mean dagger.
Priest / Healer: The class who makes sure the party survives the encounter with their heals and revives.
Mage / Wizard: The class with the spells to burn, freeze, electrify, or just make enemies disappear.
Summoner / Necromancer / Druid: Minions galore with the summoning powers of this class.
SuperGummying:	No fire emblem for you

SuperGummying:	Why is Bella never here when you guys attack me?
Neon Strike Kitty:	So are we gonna appoint a hunting party?
Deino Mite:	eyan, you keep getting distracted by us. no matter how much you try, you are gonna get distracted so you might as well just give up trying
SuperGummying:	I got a question though
Kugallyblitz:	penelope should be the kingdom's executioner. hand gummy to her when he's stepped over the line 😉
Master9000:	@Hunting Party FIND HIM
Neon Strike Kitty:	And apparently you forgot your grammar at home
SuperGummying:	Now I'm hiding

Kugallyblitz:	there i see it
SuperGummying:	There we go
Kugallyblitz:	oh
Kugallyblitz:	no
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	Did it work?
Kugallyblitz:	😮
SuperGummying:	And I found this
SuperGummying:	I did math today
SuperGummying:	But never showed you guys
Kugallyblitz:	sorry ida I was talking to dino
SuperGummying:	I showed Bella this
Kugallyblitz:	hey there ida
Kugallyblitz:	hey there gummy
Kugallyblitz:	I was able to watch like 6 ads on eyans last stream from this
SuperGummying:	Hey guys
Kugallyblitz:	but it SHOULD work, if it doesn't then dont do it for another hour
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got my priorities straight
Deino Mite:	ok
Kugallyblitz:	yes you need to wait an hour
Neon Strike Kitty:	now I'm researching universities to apply to
Neon Strike Kitty:	Spent all day watching Red vs Blue
Deino Mite:	do i need to wait an hour?
Deino Mite:	so, i turned ad block on, clicked watch ad, turned it off, got the bits, then did the same thing and it wouldnt let me watch the ad
Kugallyblitz:	but if it allows you to watch another ad dont pass it up
Kugallyblitz:	if you're lucky you'll get 10 bits or even 15
Kugallyblitz:	it will only give ya like 5 bits each time
Kugallyblitz:	just so you know
Kugallyblitz:	me too, I have 55 as of now
Deino Mite:	im gonna save up for a giant bit so i can nuke the cup
Kugallyblitz:	so now we can shower eyan in like 5xs the bits as usual on fridays!
Kugallyblitz:	but keep in mind it works like 60%
Kugallyblitz:	and if it worked then it'll prompt you to another ad
Kugallyblitz:	bu you'll hit it before hand
Kugallyblitz:	it takes like 4 seconds for the button to deactivate
Kugallyblitz:	so when you turn off adblock
Kugallyblitz:	cos when you have adblock ON when you go to collect bits, the watch ad button is active
Deino Mite:	nice
Kugallyblitz:	this allowed me to get like 40 bits yesterday
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Kugallyblitz leveled up!**
Kugallyblitz:	1. Go to the "Get Bits" option like normal
2. If it won't allow you to watch ads then just exit out, Turn ON adblock, and redo step 1. But when you go to get bits, turn off adblock right when you hit the watch ad button
2.1 If you do have adblock off, just get bits as normal, after you DO get bits, turn ON adblock.
If it didn't let you collect bits with ad block off, then just wait like 30 minutes to an hour with adblock ON
3. Now that after you have collected your bits (or not depending on how long you waited since last time you got bits), and your adblock is ON, go to collect bits again, but before hitting the "watch ad" button turn off the adblock, and wait 2 seconds, then if it worked, you should be able to watch another ad. <@191299047896776704> 
Repeat this in another 1 hour or so.
Necro:	I must say that new Lucio skin is the tits
SuperGummying:	*throws pizza at Dragonite*
SuperGummying:	I have pizza
Kugallyblitz:	ok so it's a bit complicated so gimmie a sec to type it all out 😛
Deino Mite:	i need to get more bits for onii-chan
Deino Mite:	how do you do it?
Dragonite:	productivity is overrated
Kugallyblitz:	yesterday I was at 15 bits, Im now at 50 from this weird glitch you can do
Deino Mite:	being productive is a difficult task
Kugallyblitz:	I wonder if I can abuse the bit thing and get 40 bits again today 🤔
Deino Mite:	and good luck being productive
KingofZeal:	If I remember
Deino Mite:	let me know when you watch it and what you think
KingofZeal:	It's not going so well.  😛

SuperGummying:	Fine can I sleep on your couch today?
Master9000:	is that not rude because im a coward?
Master9000:	*is a coward for one minute to prove a point* gummy everyone hates you
Master9000:	ok
superheronerd:	Yes it is.
superheronerd:	..
SuperGummying:	It's not rude if you're a coward 😁
Master9000:	this reminds me of the time gummy tried to call the cops on me for charging him rent...
willofd2011:	Asking a lady to sleep on the floor? Rude lol
SuperGummying:	I'll get the bed 😋
SuperGummying:	Okay tomorrow you sleep on the floor
superheronerd:	hey. It's a sheltered place of rest.
willofd2011:	Yep lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	You can't just ask for things like that, they have to happen naturally
SuperGummying:	I sleep on your floor remember
SuperGummying:	Bella couldn't you be nice to me for one day?
willofd2011:	Mhm lol
superheronerd:	Gotta pay your dues, man.
SuperGummying:	It's probably going to be her threatening to kick me out if I don't play
SuperGummying:	No
willofd2011:	More cookies? Lol
SuperGummying:	And that means no kicking me out of house
SuperGummying:	actually Bella you probably can convince me but you probably have to think of something to make me be convinced
SuperGummying:	CAN't
Deino Mite:	ok
superheronerd:	I'll do it when I get home
superheronerd:	I don't have my list on me

Neon Strike Kitty:	Is Gummy playing on Phoenix?

SuperGummying:	That was a fun movie
Zaranius:	I got it when it was on deal so i can't complain and i have put 47 hours into it
Zaranius:	here ya go if your curious
Zaranius:	http://store.steampowered.com/app/282800/100_Orange_Juice/
Zaranius:	Nah think Mario Party + Dokapon Kingdom + Anime
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sounds like Cookie Clicker
Master9000:	using a rusty old grinder you work your way up to the very peak of society
Master9000:	grinding those damn oranges
Master9000:	expected orange grinding simulator
Zaranius:	when the currency is Oranges i think it's allowed
Master9000:	0/10 name missleading
Zaranius:	It's a steam game
Master9000:	that is called an orange
Master9000:	i do believe
Zaranius:	Anyone here have 100% Orange Juice?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Thing about Elder Scrolls is, it has magic and a leveling system
PKMN03:	And call it a new game
PKMN03:	Sure lets take Elder Scrolls, slap Link on it, throw in some bullshit for good measure
Master9000:	lets call it league of legends
Master9000:	shit now the game wont launch
Master9000:	*shakes code*
Neon Strike Kitty:	In recent years they kind of let the formula become standard
Neon Strike Kitty:	They shake up the formula
Neon Strike Kitty:	Zelda's always been kind of about the innovation
PKMN03:	Cya
Necro:	Bye
KingofZeal:	Peace
Master9000:	good luck
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I'm dead, I need to try to actually accomplish something with my day before stream
PKMN03:	Good game, just not a good **ZELDA** game
Necro:	As they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions
PKMN03:	I still say BotW isn't a good Zelda game imo
PKMN03:	I know
KingofZeal:	Good intentions don't make bad situations better
PKMN03:	Well to be fair, the reason they made it so you can only catch new Pokémon until the after game was made in good taste even if it ended up backfiring <@!304073163669766158>
Master9000:	they were as productive as riven
Master9000:	violence to end violence
Necro:	In my opinion I believe that 5th gen didn't add much to franchise in general except a moral question that was scewed in the first place due to the fact that team plasma was also doing the same thing as what they were fighting against
Master9000:	*tries to hack into eyans patreon account just ot make the damn connection since he wont <:Kappa:305551256104206336>*
Kugallyblitz:	Well guys I'm gonna go quiet cos I have english work I'd LOVE to get done, later, and good luck eyan with uhh... redoing the whatever I saw lol
Zaranius:	God i hate playing Jax
PKMN03:	Finally transferred them up a couple months ago
KingofZeal:	I beg to differ, but that's mainly cause I have a strong distaste for 5th gen
Necro:	Not really
PKMN03:	I still have all the Black and White event Pokémon except victini
PKMN03:	Good times
PKMN03:	Remember when Black and White was new?
KingofZeal:	And figured it wasn't worth leaving something incomplete up
KingofZeal:	Cause I lost the footage to the parts I didn't upload
PKMN03:	Why did you delete the entire X and Y playthrough from your channel btw <@!304073163669766158> ?
Kugallyblitz:	I was about to say "whats CT never heard of it" until I realized it was chrono trigger
KingofZeal:	Probably around 20-25%
Master9000:	what % of the way thru xcom would you say we are rn?
Kugallyblitz:	Im disappointed in myself
KingofZeal:	But I still will do a full scale walkthrough eventually
KingofZeal:	I'm planning to stream CT after XCom
PKMN03:	I remember I was playing along with it and then I saw it had randomly stopped and I was super confused 😂
KingofZeal:	No
KingofZeal:	For a while I was trying to get into ekko
Master9000:	you didnt play the tutorial?
KingofZeal:	Zilean was the first champion I ever played
Master9000:	im a bit surprised eyan doesnt main zil and ekko <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	I have too many bad memories attached to some stuff that I did in that walkthrough
KingofZeal:	I'll restart it from scratch
Master9000:	oh yeah with the whole time theme
superheronerd:	Thanks
PKMN03:	Or just resume it?
PKMN03:	Are you gonna end up redoing Chrono Trigger entirely <@!304073163669766158> ?
Kugallyblitz:	good luck bella
KingofZeal:	Have fun
Master9000:	i picked zilean mid
KingofZeal:	That sounds painful Bella
Master9000:	its ok
superheronerd:	Well guys.
Wish me luck 
I have a class all about annotated bibliographies right now..
KingofZeal:	Oh right, I like playing healers
Master9000:	***HEROES NEVER DIE***
Kugallyblitz:	im personally not bothered that you aren't currently doing youtube cos I get just as much if not more out of your streams
KingofZeal:	I'm dead, somebody rez me
KingofZeal:	*headsdesk*
Kugallyblitz:	it'll happen eventually, no need to rush, it'll be all worth it
Master9000:	start with connecting patreon to discord <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
KingofZeal:	And this has been Eyan's daily reminder that he still needs to make YouTube a thing again
superheronerd:	Jeez
PKMN03:	4 or 5 years give or take
Master9000:	before you can face me
KingofZeal:	I actually don't remember that at all, but I don't really remember anything from that far back.  I kind of blocked that time out of my memory
Master9000:	yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa~~~~~





aaaaaaaaaaaaars
PKMN03:	Probably 5 years ago now
PKMN03:	This is the kind of random crap I remember
superheronerd:	How long ago was that?
Master9000:	very much so
Kugallyblitz:	oh it so is
PKMN03:	It was like the elite 4 and he said in one of the intros that he was having someone else upload it <@!162952008712716288>
KingofZeal:	Being rude to characters if fun though
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	the game needs a queue with random people to get him to play it
Master9000:	oh so thats what cards against humanity was missing
Kugallyblitz:	my favorite parts of the walkthroughs is when he would say something quite rude to the characters in the game. So I love watching him play xcom for that reason haha, mario tennis was awesome too
Master9000:	i dont recall that lmao
PKMN03:	Remember when you ended up having someone else upload the last few parts? 😅
PKMN03:	<@!304073163669766158> I still remember when you were doing Black and White... feels like yesterday...

KingofZeal:	I find it ironic that the group that probably gets the most harassed about donations is college students
Kugallyblitz:	I'm quite normal BMI of 19.1
superheronerd:	Ahhh he was asking for donations. I am a broke college student
KingofZeal:	I'm only borderline underweight, not actually underweight
superheronerd:	Hey I have a good bmi tyvm
Kugallyblitz:	If a monk and I were to cross paths and they stopped me for something, it'd be very awkward, as Im not very social
superheronerd:	This campus something else sometimes
Kugallyblitz:	😮
superheronerd:	I was just stopped by a monk
Kugallyblitz:	I can go for brunch that's it
Master9000:	<@!141255588846895105> dont get triggered at how low this chat's average BMI is lmao

Necro:	I normally only have breakfast and thats it

SuperGummying:	You helped me cheat
Master9000:	You cheated <@199725993416589313>
Master9000:	We've chased them for 2 blocks now
SuperGummying:	How did I pass drivers ed?
superheronerd:	I need a full report thereafter.
SuperGummying:	You know I been thinking
Master9000:	Pursuing the car thieves
Neon Strike Kitty:	but 95 is ridiculous
SuperGummying:	Call and drive
Neon Strike Kitty:	maybe around 70
SuperGummying:	Don't text and drive
Neon Strike Kitty:	I seriously doubt it's 95%
superheronerd:	Who woulda thought it
Master9000:	I didn't know you were in buffalo
superheronerd:	Been looking for that thing everywhere
SuperGummying:	Bella can drive?
superheronerd:	Hey, thanks for finding my car.
Kugallyblitz:	THAT LICENSE PLATE
Kugallyblitz:	LOLOL
Kugallyblitz:	btw 95% is a hard estimate/exaggeration
Master9000:	@midnightbella hello there
superheronerd:	I nearly do them all to myself. So what then?
Kugallyblitz:	Think about it™
Kugallyblitz:	Guys, 95% of all injuries happen outside.
Master9000:	And uncomfortably hot
Kugallyblitz:	outside is risky
Master9000:	Yeah it's spooky
KingofZeal:	Sounds scary
Kugallyblitz:	I can type
KingofZeal:	Outside, what's that?
Kugallyblitz:	when clouds are lightly thick but everywhere in the sky they create that affect
superheronerd:	You guys and your cloudy skies and probable cool weather
Neon Strike Kitty:	Do you not go outside much?
Kugallyblitz:	the clouds making a weird affect on the sub's light
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's the sun as seen though the clouds.
Neon Strike Kitty:	wtf is that what?
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	that's our lord and savior
SuperGummying:	*beats blitz out of excitement from the movie*
Master9000:	Wtf is that thing
Kugallyblitz:	when eyan was streaming on saturday, my parents were like "Ok we'll be back in like 20 minutes." they came back in 2 1/2 hours. I thought they died
Neon Strike Kitty:	PRAISE THE SUN!
SuperGummying:	Can't wait for the movie
SuperGummying:	I'm in the mall
regal swan:	i agree
Kugallyblitz:	but not when you're waiting for someone
Kugallyblitz:	car rides are fun
Master9000:	Waiting in the car for my mom so we can drive home
Kugallyblitz:	so master what are you up to
Master9000:	That oh I can still do this and this today and oh look now it's 6 am there goes my sleep
Master9000:	Even then it takes like 5 mins
superheronerd:	Like last Wednesday 😁
Master9000:	Same Eyan
superheronerd:	The only times I'm tired enough to sleep whenever is when I'm very ill
SuperGummying:	Totally not a sponsor msg
Kugallyblitz:	wow, that sounds like a pain
SuperGummying:	Drink coffee
SuperGummying:	If you are feeling tired
Master9000:	Finished school for today <:FeelsGoodMan:305609186996125696>
KingofZeal:	I wish I could do that, but I can't fall asleep quickly, even if I am super tired.  I have to be downright sleep deprived to fall asleep quickly
Kugallyblitz:	One time I woke up at 7:50 am cos school, when I got like 4 hours sleep,  so when I went to go get a drink, I found my carpet quite soft, so I laid down and took a 20 minute nap on the floor. I wish I was joking
superheronerd:	I know I wake up at 7:30. I've done it forever now.
_sleeps at midnight_
KingofZeal:	So tragic
superheronerd:	For example, last night.
KingofZeal:	Sometimes I'm at my most lively when I want to sleep
KingofZeal:	SAME *stabs self*
superheronerd:	It's annoying
superheronerd:	Is when I need to sleep, I can get a random surge of energy
superheronerd:	The worst part about that
Kugallyblitz:	I find going to sleep when you're REALLY tired the best, but sleeping when you're moderately tired the worst cos you're just sittin there... thinkin
Kugallyblitz:	I did it that one time and I fell asleep before eyan ended stream
Kugallyblitz:	but after that its not bad
Kugallyblitz:	9am - 2pm is the hardest part
superheronerd:	I was like that for a while but when I started work I randomly was able to immediately reset myself
KingofZeal:	I didn't do myself favors by always scheduling late classes, lol
Kugallyblitz:	but you have to really keep yourself awake
Kugallyblitz:	I find starting over and staying up for like 24 hours to be the best option
superheronerd:	Sounds like my summers when I was younger lol
KingofZeal:	When you figure that out Kugal, let me know, been trying to solve that for like, 5 years now
Kugallyblitz:	like pull a 24 hour wake up session to start over?
Kugallyblitz:	what do you guys recommend if a sleep schedule is way outta whack? like you onyl feel tired at 4 am and sleep in till like 2 Pm when you mean to get up at like 11?
KingofZeal:	The troubles of both liking sleep and wanting time to do crap
SuperGummying:	Btw your floor is not comfortable Bella
superheronerd:	Only time i get 6-7 is Monday's or Fridays
SuperGummying:	I didn't sleep till 2 yesterday
KingofZeal:	I sometimes get like that off of 6, but then I crash, and unfortunately, I feel the same Bella
superheronerd:	I don't like sleeping past 9 hours. Feel like I just waste time
Kugallyblitz:	gummy I'd watch out
Kugallyblitz:	6 hours makes me wake up and feel like I have the most energy i have no clue why
SuperGummying:	Jk jk
SuperGummying:	Was calling and driving 😁
SuperGummying:	Was not texting and driving
SuperGummying:	Don't worry
Kugallyblitz:	I tend to find like 6 hours worth of sleep the most refreshing if that makes sense
KingofZeal:	I can usually function on 6, I need 8 to not be exhausted all day, and I usually like 9-10 as the sweet spot
SuperGummying:	Gum gum back
superheronerd:	6 is the least I can get
Kugallyblitz:	that is if I wake up after 8 hours
Kugallyblitz:	I find if i sleep for morn than 8 hours I get groggy, which makes me sleep even more
KingofZeal:	Unlike yesterday where I was a permanent yawn machine
Kugallyblitz:	like groggy tired yeah?
KingofZeal:	Yeah, it is a different sort of tired, and it will usually go away
Neon Strike Kitty:	but at least it's a different sort of tired
regal swan:	always
Kugallyblitz:	so stay up forever now
Neon Strike Kitty:	I know the pain so well
Kugallyblitz:	sleep does nothing
Kugallyblitz:	same LOL
KingofZeal:	Ahhhhhhh, nothing like a super long good night's rest to still wake up and be tired.  Screw me
superheronerd:	Dang blitz.
Kugallyblitz:	so they had to answer when I was gone lol
Kugallyblitz:	and other students were confused cos I always answer
Kugallyblitz:	in the middle I had to use the bathroom, so I wasnt around to answer any problems
Kugallyblitz:	Im out of math class

Deino Mite:	Ya
superheronerd:	_needs to play echoes_
superheronerd:	That was nearly the same message

SuperGummying:	here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall
superheronerd:	_realizes that I am just wasting my time_
Deino Mite:	Also, most of the people who died in the bombing were civilians, not soldiers who signed up.
SuperGummying:	than nuke
SuperGummying:	tell them to fall back
SuperGummying:	i would invade them first
Master9000:	they were already everywhere stealing from the US
SuperGummying:	no no no
Deino Mite:	But by dropping the bomb, the US scared the Russians, so they had to build their own bomb as fast as they can.
superheronerd:	Army?
superheronerd:	And your like
superheronerd:	So the entire people innocent to that would suffer?
Master9000:	your own people get nuked too

SuperGummying:	when they invaded vietnam

Master9000:	the soviets were alraedy at odds before it detonated
Master9000:	the bomb didnt cause the cold war at all tho
SuperGummying:	they had to coming
SuperGummying:	for me i disagree
Deino Mite:	I'm gonna write about how I'm against it because the Japanese were already negotiating surrender and the bomb being dropped caused the Cold War.
SuperGummying:	just write about muskets
Master9000:	the stressor being studied still applies
Deino Mite:	I have an essay to write about the use of the atomic bomb on Japan.
Deino Mite:	Ya
SuperGummying:	sounds fun
superheronerd:	Oh well

Deino Mite:	FUG?
Master9000:	*imprints fire emblem sign instead of FUG on deino* still think you can never have too much? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deino Mite:	but my desire for fire emblem can never be satiated so 🤷
Master9000:	I can't tell on mobile tho
Master9000:	Another example is ```css
1 word [author]
```
Deino Mite:	i like the format but as always, i wish there were more far emblem
KingofZeal:	I'll experiment with it next week
Master9000:	That's the one Ayana uses for the music thing
KingofZeal:	Oooh
Master9000:	Try putting css right after the last top side `
Master9000:	It's code block
Master9000:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	Ah
KingofZeal:	```test```
Master9000:	Maybe put ``` on either side of the schedule
Master9000:	I think this format is good for now
KingofZeal:	Holy moly I can't stop yawning
KingofZeal:	Or maybe that's just the sleep deprivation talking
KingofZeal:	I'm sure I'll continue to make format changes, but I felt like I was on to something
Animal_Glue_:	Agreed 😃
SuperGummying:	master you can't jump over me
superheronerd:	Structure is clean and organized. 👌
Master9000:	I like the structure
SuperGummying:	yes i like it a lot Eyan

KingofZeal:	In other news, do you guys like the overall look/direction of the weekly posts?
SuperGummying:	not moving
Master9000:	*jumps over Bella and throws 20 knives at gummy from above*
SuperGummying:	*still hiding behind bella*
KingofZeal:	Take a step away and suddenly, more popcorn is needed
superheronerd:	_has an introspective crisis_
Animal_Glue_:	*waits for more fighting*
SuperGummying:	im scared
Master9000:	He thinks she's super girl irl and nothing can kill her
SuperGummying:	bella protect me pls
KingofZeal:	Probably because you let people use you as a shield bella
Animal_Glue_:	lol
Master9000:	Ikr
Deino Mite:	thats not how hiding behind someone works
Animal_Glue_:	*Throws popcorn at gummy*
superheronerd:	Why the hell am I the human shield?
Master9000:	*asks Bella to move out of the way and she ends up stabbing gummy for me as well*

Master9000:	*gets encouraged by eyan*
SuperGummying:	Eyan don't encourage them
Animal_Glue_:	*grabs popcorn*
Master9000:	I never thought of it that way
Master9000:	*continues shaking gummy while also laughing at the thought of hiding behind someone will grant you an invincible shield or something*
KingofZeal:	Oh, it makes sense now, this is why Gummy likes the French
Deino Mite:	stop hiding behind women
Deino Mite:	gummy, you are acting like a frenchman: cowardly
SuperGummying:	*hides behind bella again*
Master9000:	*shakes gummy for 10 mins*
SuperGummying:	be nice to your sister
SuperGummying:	master
Master9000:	If she tried to shake me for 10 minutes she would have run out of the room crying lol
KingofZeal:	I'm going to need 10 minutes of shaking if I don't get a long night of rest
SuperGummying:	i woke up around 10:45 today
Master9000:	My sister shook me for five minutes to wake me up today
KingofZeal:	And they weren't particularly quality hours of sleep
Master9000:	Oh two nights
KingofZeal:	I'm running on like, 8 hours at best of sleep over two nights, not one
SuperGummying:	true
Deino Mite:	he's always tired and dead

SuperGummying:	The only digital stuff I have is Pokemon x
SuperGummying:	Besides pc stuff

SuperGummying:	It all comes down to the situation for me
SuperGummying:	I prefer hard copies but digital sometimes is nice
superheronerd:	I like hard copies.
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~also it's cheaper~~
Neon Strike Kitty:	I despise digital but sometimes it's the only option
SuperGummying:	Digital sounds nice though
superheronerd:	Which is why I probably will get it myself for that reason
superheronerd:	Ofc haha
SuperGummying:	You would need a hard copy wouldn't you?
SuperGummying:	Wait how would I actually?

NightShade:	*goes to google*
Aqua033:	The only part of the watch order I know is Bakemonogatari S1 into Nisemonogatari
Aqua033:	Monogatari's a bit hard to follow, because you need to know the watch order
NightShade:	But I haven't seen those three <@!136689448225210368>
NightShade:	Already seen HunterXHunter, loved it.

NightShade:	Speaking of anime: Does anyone have any recommendations?
regal swan:	is blue exorcist good? i remember hearing good stuff
Deino Mite:	id also say sword art online, but only watch it if you hate yourself. its good if you are new to anime but nothing else. other than that, it is complete garbage
regal swan:	ill check them out later thx
Deino Mite:	i think the fate series is fantasy, but i havent finished it yet
Deino Mite:	re:zero is fantasy
Master9000:	Someday I may write down the story of how I became the complete opposite of anything weeb related
Deino Mite:	no game no life is kinda fantasy
Deino Mite:	oh, Wolrd End: What do you do at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us? is a pretty good fantasy one that is currently airing

Deino Mite:	so is konosuba
Deino Mite:	log horizon is pretty good
regal swan:	that are sorts long?
regal swan:	ik fairy tail but are there other more magic/sword/fanasty anime?
regal swan:	i been more into fanasty lately but anime cool
Deino Mite:	eyan watches anime too. i wouldnt trash talk anime unless you want the wrath of our king to rain down upon you
Master9000:	That's why you're allowed here
Deino Mite:	(even if it is the wrong one)
Deino Mite:	you are entitled to your own opinion
Master9000:	My point is further proven
Deino Mite:	and that is why we cant have a discussion about wincest anime
Master9000:	And has serious repercussions
Master9000:	From my point of view the culture is not worth investment in
regal swan:	ouch
Deino Mite:	and clearly those are hard to come by here
Deino Mite:	<@!304073163669766158> let me know when you watch the new eromanga-sensei cus i want to discuss it with a cultured individual
Master9000:	This should be in <#311402910820859914> but it's relevant to the conversation

SuperGummying:	Btw Bella try honey or something
SuperGummying:	Everyone should sleep tbh
Neon Strike Kitty:	I should sleep but I need to get up soon and I've got no alarm
NightShade:	*gives bella 160 cough drops*
SuperGummying:	But meh
SuperGummying:	Idk why
SuperGummying:	I can't sleep as well
superheronerd:	Because coughs are a thing
superheronerd:	I can't sleep
SuperGummying:	We are going to have a party
SuperGummying:	Yup going to night shade's house for the night
SuperGummying:	*crawls out*
superheronerd:	You're excused nightshade~
SuperGummying:	Wait I'm still under your bed Bella
SuperGummying:	I will not sleep Bella

Kugallyblitz:	It's been such a pleasure
Kugallyblitz:	Ok, I'm tired. Off to bed I go. See ya guys :^)
Kugallyblitz:	YES
NightShade:	But... why not Magic cards?
Kugallyblitz:	*gives gummy $50*
Kugallyblitz:	well why didnt you say sooner!
SuperGummying:	Exactly
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Kugallyblitz:	To buy Yu - Gi - Oh! cards
SuperGummying:	Well you know my reasoning for 50 usd
Kugallyblitz:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kugallyblitz:	I would CONSIDER giving you $50 USD if I didn't spend $240 on new drum heads
SuperGummying:	You're no fun
Kugallyblitz:	No, sorry lol
SuperGummying:	Pls
Kugallyblitz:	No
SuperGummying:	Blitz can I borrow $50 usd?
Kugallyblitz:	no problem SUCH an awesome song
NightShade:	Thanks Kugal!
SuperGummying:	Not legally though
SuperGummying:	I also have the ds version
Kugallyblitz:	thats the version
Kugallyblitz:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYoGFvn_fOk
Kugallyblitz:	<@!174301934985936896>
Neon Strike Kitty:	*has the DS version*
Kugallyblitz:	i need to watch a wlkthrough of chrono trigger
NightShade:	*immediately goes to youtube to listen to said song*
SuperGummying:	That's expensive
SuperGummying:	Chrono trigger went from $9.99 to $13.99 on mobile
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah
KingofZeal:	Corridors of Time
Neon Strike Kitty:	Which song?
SuperGummying:	Wait what
Kugallyblitz:	definitely, not only that it's so relaxing and I cannot stop listening
SuperGummying:	Must stay awake
SuperGummying:	I'm falling asleep
KingofZeal:	It's also basically the theme song of Zeal
KingofZeal:	It's probably one of, if not my favorite video game song, combined with a 10/10 remix of it
majora:	I know lol
Kugallyblitz:	Eyan I'm listening to your outro music from stream on youtube man it's SO AWESOME
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	She's joking
majora:	We are no longer friends neon strike kitty
SuperGummying:	But I have no idea what to do
KingofZeal:	I try to minimize spoilers, but once I stream the game, I probably will be less prone to keeping things spoiler free
NightShade:	That's my goal when I have Tuesday-Thursday off next week
SuperGummying:	I should play it
NightShade:	It's okay Majora, I'm still working on finishing it myself.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lavos is Crono's father!
majora:	Even tho they are chrono trigger references no one will spoil that game right??? I still have yet to finish it >.<
KingofZeal:	I'm still kind of cleaning things up so hopefully it will be a little more organized in the coming days.
Neon Strike Kitty:	<#305486914910158848> is your intro to the server
KingofZeal:	North cape explains everything, still kind of a work in progress
Mårten:	Ok
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's all Chrono trigger references
Mårten:	I dont understand the channel names 😄

Zaranius:	lel
Kugallyblitz:	stupid moobot
Kugallyblitz:	ey yi yi I got banned again
Deino Mite:	im playing fire emblem
Animal_Glue_:	Can't join stream, practice for high school graduation tonight. Send my love.
Deino Mite:	so she can function as a pseudomage
Deino Mite:	although mae's stats are actually pretty good and she doesnt suffer from the reduced damage penalty of normal staff users
Deino Mite:	i only summon when i can do a full summon with 20 orbs
Zaranius:	Meh i had 5 gems i dident want
Deino Mite:	plus id rather save my orbs for an event when there is a hero i want
Deino Mite:	i dont think they are that amazing
Deino Mite:	im not gonna try to pull for any of the heroes from the echoes focus
Zaranius:	Got her 2 days ago aswell xD
Deino Mite:	i really need a green mage for my team so i wanted to get her
Deino Mite:	got leo instead
Deino Mite:	didnt get a single female mage
Deino Mite:	i tried for julia so hard during the femal mages summoning
Zaranius:	Cant believe i got her last day of the female draw xD
Deino Mite:	and julia!
Zaranius:	
Deino Mite:	cus light breath sucks
Deino Mite:	she's pretty good if you can get lightning breath on her
Zaranius:	got her one first draw
Zaranius:	only blue orb
Deino Mite:	nice pull
Zaranius:	She's... Perfect
Deino Mite:	well i mean, technically its not me, its the protagonist, but they are basically the same thing in a video game
SuperGummying:	Rainy slap him
Deino Mite:	im off on a quest to reclaim my long lost cousin/waifu
Deino Mite:	fire emblem echoes is fun
Rainy:	Entertain me friends, I'm in this for the long haul.
Rainy:	lol, I'm so petty. I came to my little brother's school to pick him up and he started bitching at me, so now we're sitting in the parking lot until he says"please"
Deino Mite:	we need to have a discussion sometime about the bloodline and timeline of fire emblem
Deino Mite:	you cant play lunatic first playthrough
Luckyskarm:	I bought Echoes XD
Master9000:	Oh I thought they always did that
superheronerd:	Not again
Deino Mite:	even Fire Emblem is setting up the wincest plotline
Deino Mite:	lol
Deino Mite:	when the beginning scene of echoes says that Celica and Alm are cousins, but not by blood
KingofZeal:	Could be as early as just knocking off my current to play list, could be later
KingofZeal:	I'd say awakening is on my list before the year is out for streaming, depends on how the game list goes
SuperGummying:	Camilla 😍
SuperGummying:	I have conquest
superheronerd:	I love awakening
Deino Mite:	ive played about 50% of the game and im excited to see eyan play CT because he is the reason I got it
Deino Mite:	there is a new main series fire emblem game coming for the switch next year so i would recommend playing awakening before then, and if you get a switch then you can get it on release and stream it then to get on the front of twitch page
Master9000:	50% looking forward to it because it's Eyan's favorite game, 50% to make canon references to everything happening here better
KingofZeal:	But that's probably because I'm long past my yearly replay of it
KingofZeal:	I myself am pretty hyped to replay CT
KingofZeal:	CT will be long before FE realmaster, don't worry, lol
Master9000:	The fan made game
Deino Mite:	after that
Deino Mite:	oh
Master9000:	But CT
Deino Mite:	you should stream it after xcom
Deino Mite:	good choice
KingofZeal:	I was planning on awakening first, mainly cause it's the one I own, lol
Deino Mite:	of the second game in the franchise
Deino Mite:	also, echoes is a remake
Master9000:	Why not just play all of them at once <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deino Mite:	its the game that revived the series and its my favorite game of them all
Deino Mite:	play awakening first
KingofZeal:	But they're making them too fast, lol
KingofZeal:	One of these days I'll get around to playing fire emblem
superheronerd:	Tell me what you think of it later 😁
Deino Mite:	i cant play it on lunatic for first playthrough!
superheronerd:	Thanks👍🏼
superheronerd:	Not bad.
Deino Mite:	$40
superheronerd:	How much was it?
Master9000:	Nintendo is cranking those out lol

SuperGummying:	Because that isn't nice master
Dragonite:	natural selection
Master9000:	Why didn't you push him all the way in instead of taking the photo?
Aqua033:	This kid went up to a trash can and put his body in it

SuperGummying:	it used to say The Gumlin Empire
Deino Mite:	so...
VortexOA:	lol i know. i'm just being dramatic. it was very fun, and we had a lot more freedom, but its whatever.
Deino Mite:	it was camelot until the last 15 minutes
SuperGummying:	The Gumlin Empire
SuperGummying:	ahem
Deino Mite:	i miss the other server because i had power there and it was camelot. i like medieval and fantasy stuff
SuperGummying:	i never knew how much you like that place vortex
SuperGummying:	but even i let go
SuperGummying:	dude i hate change
SuperGummying:	before we shut down
VortexOA:	as a man who hates the thought of change... i am sad
SuperGummying:	we need to wait for ida
VortexOA:	clearly
SuperGummying:	HEY
Dragonite:	clearly, this is the most important thing that happened on the Gummy server, ever: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/237812129665777664/288506314026647552/unknown.png
SuperGummying:	i hate Robespierre

SuperGummying:	you guys have to make it public
Master9000:	the reign is over
VortexOA:	and then the gumlin empire was no more... Rest in peace.
superheronerd:	The ascension of emo in this movie is great
Kugallyblitz:	very tasty
NightShade:	Ooh, sounds good :3
Kugallyblitz:	I like vanilla and butter finger ice cream the best yumyum
willofd2011:	Ice cream <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
NightShade:	I have a slight obsession with food... xD
Kugallyblitz:	😮
NightShade:	😄
NightShade:	Chocolate Mint Chocolate Chip
NightShade:	They had a new type at the store, so I bought that to try
Kugallyblitz:	what kind?
Kugallyblitz:	NOM
Kugallyblitz:	ICE CREAM
SuperGummying:	wb
NightShade:	I'm excited to see where everyone ended up. Also I return with delicious ice cream 😄
Deino Mite:	ill miss you until then ❤
Deino Mite:	sayonara onii-chan
Kugallyblitz:	alrighty, this is gonna be awesome
superheronerd:	See you in a bit, then 👍🏼
KingofZeal:	We can talk once I start stream
KingofZeal:	I need to finish setting up
Master9000:	lol
KingofZeal:	Anyways
cadance:	Also they can give everyone the D <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Mind you, being on the D squad isn't a bad thing, because they'll be the first people to replace anybody who dies on the A team
Luckyskarm:	Figured
Master9000:	inb4 no
Deino Mite:	onii-chan, do i have a special place in your heart?
KingofZeal:	Unfortunately, you were one of the people who I just could not find the space for, you'll probably be one of the first people for the D squad
Demon Lord 93:	I haven't been on much the last few days because of BotW lol
Master9000:	youre 17th in activity if you were asking about that
cadance:	Like I said master lol
Luckyskarm:	Where am I?
Master9000:	and thats just my test dummy
willofd2011:	Okie dokie ^w^
Master9000:	holy shit strike is in 39th
superheronerd:	This sounds very complex. I like it.
Kugallyblitz:	Now we know which squad gets the most cookies now
KingofZeal:	As a gunner
KingofZeal:	You're on the B team
willofd2011:	May I ask what team I'm on? Lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	I tried to give everyone a role they like, mind you some of the people on the top 3 squads haven't been recruited yet
cadance:	Yeah but to be fair there's really only like 12 people who talk on a regular basis
Deino Mite:	who else calls you onii-chan?
KingofZeal:	If so, C team
KingofZeal:	You're pi-master right?
Deino Mite:	onii-chan, what team am i on and where am i in your heart?
Master9000:	<@!140627136900759552> youre 15th/83 so thats pretty good
KingofZeal:	I know there were a few people who had to be cut because there was only so much space
KingofZeal:	And if for whatever reason you're active and not on one of the 3 main teams, you'll probably be some of the first recruits who start the D team
Luckyskarm:	Cadance was like: WE HAD A MOMENT
Kugallyblitz:	k, cool cool then
KingofZeal:	Yeah, you're on the same squad kugal
superheronerd:	I accidentally unchecked the psi one I think so that's perfect 👍🏼
Kugallyblitz:	It's gonna be awesome to be back on the Malicious Medians or I think thats what my squad was called
superheronerd:	Oooh that sounds cool
KingofZeal:	I plan to have 3 main squads, and as many as 4 backup squads
cadance:	And that's why Eyan never says nice things to me <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
willofd2011:	Lol XD
KingofZeal:	Basically, if you've been talking in this chat at all in the last couple days, you're probably on one of the first 3 squads.  Bella and DesertSpirit are going to be delayed cause I'm making them both psi ops which requires a bit of time before I can utilize psi ops
Kugallyblitz:	LOL cadance
superheronerd:	How many teams are there?
Master9000:	oh mb
cadance:	EVERYONE SAW IT he put the heart that means he loves me that means we're gonna be together forever and ever and ever and I shall love him and he shall be mine and I shall call him squishy and he will be my little squishy oh yes he is yes he is wait where was I going with this again
Master9000:	but not in your harem, Eyan <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
KingofZeal:	The throne room is basically the A team
KingofZeal:	You're A team for helping out with Discord
KingofZeal:	kk
regal swan:	regal
KingofZeal:	You always have a spot on the A team in my heart Cadance.  ❤
Master9000:	where am i?
cadance:	Cool
KingofZeal:	I believe you're on the C team Regal, do you prefer Regal or Swan for short?
KingofZeal:	Yes Cadance, you have a spot on the A team
regal swan:	do i count?<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	yeah
cadance:	Do I count as still active?
SuperGummying:	Yay
superheronerd:	So I shall.
regal swan:	back to watching most dirty game on n64
superheronerd:	I can finally play it again
superheronerd:	Speaking of skyrim
Kugallyblitz:	sounds like a plan
willofd2011:	Okie dokie lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	I'm importing everyone's characters directly so that the most active people get soldiers first
Master9000:	and because like skyrim thats the part we always cover <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Kugallyblitz:	no problem
KingofZeal:	Just so everyone knows, I'm skipping gatecrasher, aka the first mission for the sake of having the game set up so we don't have to screw around managing squads for the first hour
regal swan:	now its regalswan1 cause twitch hates it
regal swan:	silverwolfe123
Kugallyblitz:	SO hyped for xcom
Master9000:	what was your twitch name before <@!293200537384386562> ?
KingofZeal:	If I remember, I will
regal swan:	if u want
KingofZeal:	Do you want me to change your xcom character's name while I'm at it?
cadance:	Why do I have discord in my games folder, it clearly belongs in social wtf is wrong with me
superheronerd:	Good to know 👍🏼
Kugallyblitz:	cool cool
regal swan:	so i just change my twitch name to sorta match here

SuperGummying:	yeah i like that idea
SuperGummying:	hmmm
Master9000:	have someone run an !uptime timer for anyone joining in as we go
superheronerd:	These are ideas to write down for sure
Master9000:	we could do a same time started viewing with voice chat
superheronerd:	It'd be fun to have like a Star Wars viewing thing sometime
Master9000:	i wanna watch
Master9000:	live broadcast that shit
Master9000:	yooooooooooo
SuperGummying:	Have fun
superheronerd:	We are about to watch the emofest of all emofests. The 3rd Star Wars prequel
SuperGummying:	No one needs to know what I look like
Master9000:	https://twitter.com/discordapp/status/854874338360786946
SuperGummying:	Why
Master9000:	im waiting for discord video calls to get a cam for the comp
SuperGummying:	Meh I'll just drink the coffee cream than
Luckyskarm:	Yes
SuperGummying:	Yeah you guys would be sad if I overdose wouldn't you?
SuperGummying:	Cya
Master9000:	ice cream at the comp tho
NightShade:	While Gummy goes overboard with the caffeine, I'm going to make that ice cream run. Adios for now!
SuperGummying:	Instead of 2
Luckyskarm:	But was it huge Bella?
SuperGummying:	I'll wait for 3 hours
SuperGummying:	Don't worry I'm careful
superheronerd:	You get the point
Master9000:	also for some reason everyone insists that i try coffee and its a perpetual cycle of asking them why i would do that to myself
superheronerd:	I said huge a lot in that.
Luckyskarm:	Klondike?
superheronerd:	This kid had a ton of coffee, a huge energy drink and a huge mtn dew and gave himself a huge arrhythmia
NightShade:	😮
Master9000:	i foudn a klondike bar
Master9000:	wooooooo
SuperGummying:	One day
SuperGummying:	I'm going for 8
NightShade:	Then again, I drink a fair amount of tea
NightShade:	That really is a lot of coffee... xD
superheronerd:	Don't do it
SuperGummying:	I mean nothing happened after that 5 cup of coffee once
superheronerd:	There was a news story about that recently.
Luckyskarm:	^
NightShade:	Don't do that
SuperGummying:	It's probably a caffeine overdose
SuperGummying:	Guys if I die
superheronerd:	):
superheronerd:	But I'm sick.
superheronerd:	Pretty sure I have some
SuperGummying:	How many cups of coffee did I drink today?
SuperGummying:	Let's see
willofd2011:	Lol
superheronerd:	Flavor's awesome for me.
KingofZeal:	I know right?
NightShade:	In college they definitely don't exist
Luckyskarm:	Coffee ice cream is good tho
NightShade:	MY KIIIIN
KingofZeal:	I feel like those don't exist
KingofZeal:	HEY, fellow no coffee person
NightShade:	No coffee for me, either
NightShade:	^
KingofZeal:	I stick to my "no coffee" principle in all shapes and forms
NightShade:	I guess I should also consult my bank account about this potential ice cream run
Master9000:	*checks fridge hoping to find ice cream*
NightShade:	Wintergreen is a decent minty flavor
superheronerd:	A close second a flavor for me is coffee
KingofZeal:	Love wintergreen as a mint flavor though
KingofZeal:	Also, love chocolate chips, mint is so so, I like specific minty flavors and usually that isn't the ice cream kind
SuperGummying:	Bubble gum and cotton candy
NightShade:	those are my two favorites 😄
NightShade:	Mint chocolate chip and oddly, Americone.
Master9000:	welp time to make her dissapear <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	If they did, they aren't in the story RM
SuperGummying:	I want some
SuperGummying:	Mint chocolate chip
NightShade:	Yes <@!214587785510780929> , another reason we're blanket buddies!
Master9000:	eyan do the gurus have siblings?
KingofZeal:	I remember having "birthday cake" flavored ice cream, that kind of was uh, meh
Master9000:	my sister is addicted to mint chocloate chip
superheronerd:	Nightshade. You're the best. Mint chocolate chip is my favorite
KingofZeal:	But I bet it would be interesting
KingofZeal:	Neither have I
NightShade:	*has never had bubble gum flavored ice cream*
KingofZeal:	I actually like bubble gum flavored stuff
NightShade:	I prefer Mint chocolate chip myself.
Master9000:	that reminds me to get some tomorrow
Master9000:	i havent had ice cream in a while
NightShade:	And yes, ice cream is delicious
SuperGummying:	Bubble gum is good
NightShade:	I know I have the time, but do I have the effort to not be lazy?
KingofZeal:	I had ice cream the other day, sooooo good 10/10
superheronerd:	Because that sounds gross
superheronerd:	Not bubble gum
superheronerd:	Always go on an ice cream run
SuperGummying:	Bubble gum flavour
SuperGummying:	Ice cream
superheronerd:	Also
superheronerd:	Duuude twitch con looks so fun
NightShade:	I'm debating on an ice cream run for the stream tonight...
willofd2011:	My sister is taking me to twitch con this year <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
Luckyskarm:	And I'm the bad one

SuperGummying:	You tormented me as well
Master9000:	im finally free from that parasite that has been tormenting me likewise for months
Master9000:	what do u think was causing that
SuperGummying:	That's why I don't like you
SuperGummying:	You tormented me
Master9000:	since Deci says hes the law i can have that one
Master9000:	I AM the senate
superheronerd:	It's funny you say you drag darth away, because I'm watching Star Wars
Ayana:	​no youre an insane criminal that has tormented this guy for the past week also, your pregnancy is just a food baby
Luckyskarm:	Ayana, we are still on for tea later right?
Ayana:	​*arrests Luckyskarm*
Ayana:	​wee woo wee woo Im also the cops
Master9000:	*calls the cops*
Luckyskarm:	*drags Darth away*
Master9000:	so dont hold on to that one too dearly
Master9000:	luckyskarm's mental sanity is currently on trial
SuperGummying:	And you are in charge of taking care of me because luckyskarm took me to you lol
SuperGummying:	Nope you are my big sister
superheronerd:	Seems to aqua that I am a father
Master9000:	once someone is found innocent they cannot be tried again even if new evidence arrives unless its a direct confession
SuperGummying:	Bella all you missed was that you were my sister
Master9000:	jokes on you thats actually against law
Master9000:	lmao

Luckyskarm:	Objection!
Ayana:	​```court adjourned The trial for sanity of @Lucky ❤ Kon#1263 will proceed tomorrow```
superheronerd:	I'm totally not late to reading these messages
Luckyskarm:	But you payed them to give me false papers
Master9000:	with numerous errors
Master9000:	i pointed out that you made false papers
Master9000:	whats there to question
Luckyskarm:	``'The jury just received word that Darth payed the testers to fake the results and now are questioning Darth's statements```
Ayana:	​```The Jury has unanimously agreed that @Master9000#7819 is not the father and questions the sanity of @Lucky ❤ Kon#1263```
Luckyskarm:	I was changing, scuse you
Master9000:	It appears that the prosecition likewise rests.
Ayana:	​oof
SuperGummying:	Luckyskarm answer that
Master9000:	I'm not the father of these 3.5, nor am i your husband nor have ever met you in person, preventing the previous events from being legitimately possible. The Defence rests.

SuperGummying:	Help
Master9000:	you got bellow 80 on a math final
Master9000:	yea u are
SuperGummying:	Help
SuperGummying:	Night shade he's trying to take me away
SuperGummying:	No I'm not going back
Master9000:	*sends gummy back to the mines*
SuperGummying:	Gotta hide from my mom and dad
superheronerd:	The temple of blankets I shall return to indeed
SuperGummying:	Bella I'm coming to your house
NightShade:	And return to the pile of blankets?
SuperGummying:	Nice job
superheronerd:	Now I get to go home 😌
NightShade:	Nice!
superheronerd:	Got a perfect score though
superheronerd:	No, but I've had one of those people before so I knew already thankfully
Master9000:	only group notes for us
SuperGummying:	Bella want me to hit them for you?
NightShade:	As in, you rate your teammates
NightShade:	<@!214587785510780929>  Are there group reviews?
Master9000:	someone is going to the nurse's office
Master9000:	but if you make me do an english project
superheronerd:	I carried the whole thing because they did nothing!
Master9000:	because im the only one who knows what hes doing and loves doing it too
KingofZeal:	Who hasn't been screwed by a group project
NightShade:	And forget you have a group
Master9000:	altho i do that myself when its tech related
NightShade:	At that point you just run the project yourself
SuperGummying:	Well I said I could do it for you lol
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **KingofZeal leveled up!**
KingofZeal:	Of course
superheronerd:	Because I wanted to run myself into a wall
Master9000:	*raises everything*
SuperGummying:	I know
NightShade:	*raises hand*
superheronerd:	Do you guys know the feeling of your whole group for a presentation or whatever being super unhelpful
Master9000:	im slowly working on a complexified version of that song
Luckyskarm:	Lmao
Aqua033:	Sometimes, when a door to a class goes outwards when you're in the class, I kick the door open and yell 
Some
BODY ONCE TOLD ME
Master9000:	CT fan game CC could be cool to see the overlap transition
NightShade:	I can't play them, so I want to at least see them
NightShade:	I'm excited for all of the CT games'
Master9000:	ok cya
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I need to afk now, see ya'll later
KingofZeal:	I've never played Cross, so maybe I can play that too
KingofZeal:	So it does bend a little of what's cannon, but it does an exceptional job bridging the two games
willofd2011:	Interesting
KingofZeal:	It assumes that the King didn't actually die, but was "lost" in a sense
Master9000:	oh right consequences
KingofZeal:	It also focuses more on the consequences of changing the timeline
Master9000:	but that kinda breaks time lol
KingofZeal:	The King is part of a fan game that attempts to bridge the two games together
Master9000:	time travel is fun tho so there shouldve been a really complicated method of discovering more if you got the right people together and time traveled with them
Luckyskarm:	Is it me?
Master9000:	good job xeon
KingofZeal:	The Guru of Reason, Belthasar and technically one other person are the only two who directly copy over
KingofZeal:	Certain characters make brief cameos
KingofZeal:	Cross is the official sequel, there are almost no carry over characters
Master9000:	the king is in chrono cross or is that the official sequel
KingofZeal:	I have to do my research though on whether I want to do Crimson Echoes or Flames of Eternity
KingofZeal:	For the record, after I play Chrono Trigger, I intend to play the follow up fan game that was made so ya'll can see the King in action and what inspired my username
KingofZeal:	Now you're asking questions beyond what is reasonable discussion, lol
Master9000:	what if he actually did do it and then managed to time travel back to the exact spot he left when he wouldve died
KingofZeal:	The King probably also was strong enough to do this, but canon lore killed him off, rip
KingofZeal:	Some fan lore rumors that the prince was so gifted, he could potentially cast the ultimate magic, opening a time gate
KingofZeal:	Yes, the family as a whole is basically the pinnacle of magic users
Master9000:	or is that limited to the cane chronicles
Master9000:	so woulndt schala and the other one be even more exceptionally powerful due to powerful bloodline crossing
KingofZeal:	In fact, they were probably the most magically gifted
KingofZeal:	Yes, the King and Queen were both exceptionally magically gifted
SuperGummying:	The name*
SuperGummying:	Eyan you aren't afraid of Ida beating you up if you take away? Lol
Master9000:	yeah i mean the lore doesnt seem to say which one she was, im assuming enlightened since only the gurus didnt look down on the earthbound
KingofZeal:	All humans lost the ability to use magic after the fall of Zeal, but still retained the inate ability to use it
KingofZeal:	Thus the earthbound
KingofZeal:	Humans were either born with the ability to use magic, or not
Master9000:	is the queen enlightened in the lore or just picked as the wife of the king?
KingofZeal:	But it's all fine for now
KingofZeal:	Technically I'll probably strip Ida of the name Schala at some point or another to have a prince/princess once we need to open up more mod/admin spots
cadance:	Can I be the prince? I wanna be your son <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	is it lucky T
Master9000:	since the gurus king and queen all showed up
KingofZeal:	Don't have one yet
Master9000:	i mean in the server
KingofZeal:	😉
KingofZeal:	That's spoilers
Master9000:	speaking of which where is he
SuperGummying:	Ugh goofing off in class is getting harder and harder everyday
Master9000:	the prince
KingofZeal:	Yup, it was the gurus and one other individual who first were thrown around by time travel
Master9000:	magic accidents?
cadance:	Meanwhile I can't watch any streams
KingofZeal:	Interestingly enough, the first time travelers were from antiquity, not by choice of course
Master9000:	<:Keepo:305611574327115777>
KingofZeal:	I'll stream CT after XCom, don't worry
Master9000:	waiting for the walkthrough...
cadance:	Just play the damn game and you'll understand
KingofZeal:	It's all on one timeline
KingofZeal:	*time periods
Luckyskarm:	How does one become a Garu?
KingofZeal:	The other timelines exist, we're just apart of antiquity
Master9000:	this is confusing lol
Master9000:	oh so since we're still in antiquity then the other eras dont exist yet or is the guru of time already able to do his thing
NightShade:	Then I shall search my dreams for the perfect steed! *falls asleep*
KingofZeal:	If all else fails, you can find them in your dreams, for this Kingdom is one of dreams
regal swan:	i have fireballs i good
NightShade:	\o/
KingofZeal:	I mean, I'm sure the Kingdom of Zeal can provide you horses in one way or another
NightShade:	Hmm, a tempting offer of magic... but I still need my horses.
KingofZeal:	And yes realmaster
KingofZeal:	Our era, antiquity, is the only one where humans could use magic
NightShade:	Cadance I gave you cookies, can you send me to a place I can run over people with horses? :3
KingofZeal:	Technically humans in the middle ages had no magical capabilities
Master9000:	yeah and you needed a group of 4 distinct people to get to the end of time, right?
KingofZeal:	Although our time period, antiquity is truly the best as it is the height of humanity
regal swan:	can i throw fireballs in middle ages? if not i staying here
KingofZeal:	He guards the end of time, which allows you to travel to many different time periods
Master9000:	<@!140627136900759552> help them plz
SuperGummying:	I'm not trying to break this place up
KingofZeal:	If they want to go to the middle ages, the guru of time can assist, lol
SuperGummying:	Oh sorry Eyan I didn't mean it that way
NightShade:	not today Gummy. xD
NightShade:	Uhhhhhm
NightShade:	I just want to run things over astride a mighty horse
SuperGummying:	You are my new marshal replacing master
Master9000:	so can u confirm/help these guys get to the middle ages? they seem to really want to go
NightShade:	I'm going to have to get up and get more.
NightShade:	...crap
SuperGummying:	Yes nightshade
NightShade:	I keep forgetting to buy more cookie mix
KingofZeal:	But I do like both cookies and CT lore
Master9000:	oof
KingofZeal:	And neither realmaster
KingofZeal:	Yo Gummy, in regards to earlier, I'd appreciate it if you stopped trying to split everyone into different servers.  No reason to divide people and conversation for no reason.
Master9000:	*wonders if eyans comment will be on cookies or CT lore*
NightShade:	❤
cadance:	Chocolate chip are best cookies. Maybe snickerdoodles
Master9000:	albeit also according to the lore you seem to need 2 more people to go to the end of time to then go to the middle ages
NightShade:	YES!
Master9000:	go for it
NightShade:	Wait, medieval bliss? Can I ride horses into battle and trample EVERYTHING?
SuperGummying:	Musket warfare or medieval warfare?
SuperGummying:	Wait
SuperGummying:	War?
Master9000:	go with xeon if you want war and medieval bliss
Master9000:	no gummy im in the present
SuperGummying:	That helps you relax and stuff
Master9000:	why would you have anything else tbh
SuperGummying:	Just listen to medieval music
SuperGummying:	Don't worry if you need help
NightShade:	Chocolate Chip are my favorites, so I keep mostly those on hand
NightShade:	Absolutely
cadance:	Are they chocolate chip?
Master9000:	those damn kids didnt drop me off with you so we could chat about how to undo the damage done
Master9000:	how is it always being there cadance?
NightShade:	*offers Cadance cookies*
Kireina:	🤔
cadance:	Ah depression my old friend, at least you will never leave me
NightShade:	Try sending another one?
NightShade:	? I never got one Gummy D:
SuperGummying:	Hey night shade you never reply to my pm yesterday 😭
SuperGummying:	True true
Master9000:	a house divided cannot stand
NightShade:	Besides, I like chatting with everyone. 😄
NightShade:	Team Blanket is a legion of The Kingdom of Zeal. There's no reason for a different server
Master9000:	im not the guru of time i didnt cause this
SuperGummying:	We should have like a sub team blanket server or something lol
SuperGummying:	Wait let me in pls
NightShade:	And sure Swan!
SuperGummying:	Sure
NightShade:	Oy, I didn't let you back in D:

SuperGummying:	Okay funny how you guys mention the two people I always talk to that are kinda like siblings to me
Master9000:	and you adopted kugal at some point or something i think

Luckyskarm:	And the last one has yet to be born

SuperGummying:	No way

Master9000:	sounds good
SuperGummying:	How about that?
SuperGummying:	I'm not both of your guys child
Master9000:	remember the DNA test
Master9000:	your child not mine
Luckyskarm:	He's still my child you know, I still care
Dragonite:	sure
Master9000:	hey dragonite wanna move into our house? a new room just became available
Master9000:	just leave
SuperGummying:	Night shade and Bella don't send me to my room
SuperGummying:	Who cares
Luckyskarm:	You won't be charged rent
SuperGummying:	Are you sure night shade? I'm sure that what's you meant 😁
SuperGummying:	One with the room thing
SuperGummying:	You two share equal blame
SuperGummying:	You two
Luckyskarm:	I wonder who made him want to leave
Master9000:	It was his decision to leave
Master9000:	Not really
NightShade:	That's not quite what I mean. xD
SuperGummying:	Or floor
SuperGummying:	I mean I can sleep on the couch
Luckyskarm:	Did you also forget it's your fault he ran away again?
Master9000:	Have you forgotten that I am a member of the blanket club as well lol
NightShade:	I don't share my space well... xD
NightShade:	o.o
Luckyskarm:	Why not move in w/night?
SuperGummying:	Not leaving
NightShade:	Ooh, Starbound has been pretty fun
SuperGummying:	The other rent
SuperGummying:	No I'm staying at the team blanket base
Luckyskarm:	Don't kill eachother...
Master9000:	That's your one slightly higher round while mine are lightsaber dueling, league, terraria, starbound, inventor, cbcbase, and EV3
Master9000:	Nope we gotta pick a neutral ground
SuperGummying:	Sure master Napoleon Total War
SuperGummying:	I'm more happier at the team blanket base
Master9000:	Gummy wanna duel for your freedom?
SuperGummying:	And you know what I hate it
Luckyskarm:	Gummy, all I do is send you to your room..
Master9000:	My last undamaged blade
Master9000:	That's why I stopped helping after you stopped adhering
Master9000:	Don't waste your energy on pointless shit
SuperGummying:	And father is worst
SuperGummying:	And mother you hurt me so I left you
SuperGummying:	Dragonite hurts me
Luckyskarm:	Why must you hurt people?
SuperGummying:	Master what's your daily logic thing for me today?
SuperGummying:	Meh oh well
SuperGummying:	....Dragonite you are supposed to react
SuperGummying:	Btw I'm winning with Lillie
SuperGummying:	Alright provoking game starts again
SuperGummying:	*kicks Dragonite*
Dragonite:	｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you're adopted
SuperGummying:	She kinda is like an older sister to me
Dragonite:	so basically gummy thinks he's adopted?
SuperGummying:	Even though I want to say she isn't
Luckyskarm:	She is your older sister
NightShade:	Ooh, fun
SuperGummying:	She is not your daughter
Master9000:	Also Keiber crystals
Luckyskarm:	She's my daughter, I'm sure she would
SuperGummying:	No Bella won't do that
Master9000:	Need to find a new blade and then good as new
Master9000:	I got it from the make your own section in Disney world
Luckyskarm:	I'll just have Bella give me status updates on you
Master9000:	Many times
Master9000:	A lot of stuff
NightShade:	Who did that one hit?
NightShade:	Whelp
NightShade:	Erm... we can give you a place to hide in peace
Master9000:	Shit there goes another one
SuperGummying:	You two are like going to protect me from dad and mom right?
SuperGummying:	Perfect
NightShade:	xD it's halfway between Bella and I.
SuperGummying:	It's in your back yard?
SuperGummying:	Let me guess
SuperGummying:	Yay
NightShade:	Team Blanket has a base, you can also stay in that base. 😄
SuperGummying:	I'm cool remember team blanket
SuperGummying:	Can I stay though?
Luckyskarm:	*cries again*
NightShade:	Guests don't stay in my domain for very long.
NightShade:	That... might be awhile O.o
SuperGummying:	You just need to hide me until my mom and dad forget about me
SuperGummying:	I don't need cookies
SuperGummying:	It's just me
NightShade:	I don't have enough cookies to keep having guests. D:
SuperGummying:	Darn
SuperGummying:	Wait I gotta head back to night shade's house than
SuperGummying:	Cya Bella 😋
NightShade:	Adios Bella!

SuperGummying:	He will pass you
SuperGummying:	Don't worry once the prof hears me
superheronerd:	Not sure that over the phone presentations are gonna slide, yknow?
SuperGummying:	You are such a kiddie
SuperGummying:	😋
superheronerd:	Nah, man. Thanks tho
SuperGummying:	I can still talk

Kugallyblitz:	WHOA! Skarm is orange now 👌
SuperGummying:	It was a light kick
superheronerd:	The quest for the blue name continues
SuperGummying:	😭
NightShade:	I don't know. Bad Gummy T.T
Luckyskarm:	**Luckyskarm has digivolved!**
Kugallyblitz:	nightshade why does he do this to me?
superheronerd:	No abusing blitz!!
superheronerd:	Also, nightshade, great idea
NightShade:	Gummy why D:

SuperGummying:	*kicks blitz*
Kugallyblitz:	and hi luckyskar,

Kugallyblitz:	Just here to say hi bella and gummy
SuperGummying:	Am I the only one in this team that can still talk?
superheronerd:	_has to present within the hour or so_
NightShade:	We can eat cough drops together during the stream <@!214587785510780929>  XD
SuperGummying:	Lol
NightShade:	*plays another song and keeps singing anyway*
superheronerd:	Hey. Dude we match. I can't talk right now
NightShade:	Aaaand my throat just died. I think I need to stop singing
SuperGummying:	This will keep you warm
SuperGummying:	*gives Bella jacket*
NightShade:	Sounds like fun, good luck!
Inferno:	itll be good practice for saturday at least
superheronerd:	Good luck!
Inferno:	well, Wish me luck, im off to my local smash tournament
superheronerd:	Thanks 😎
NightShade:	*injects Bella with energy*
superheronerd:	Must. Sleep.
Luckyskarm:	Hey..
superheronerd:	Energy reserve is rapidly depleting
SuperGummying:	You can protect me from my parents
SuperGummying:	Oh well guess I'll follow you
SuperGummying:	That sucks
superheronerd:	Because responsibilities. _grimaces_
SuperGummying:	Wait what?
SuperGummying:	I'll be back night shade
superheronerd:	I can't even go to my own house right now dude
NightShade:	*waves* Have fun!
SuperGummying:	Time to go to Bella's house
SuperGummying:	Thanks
SuperGummying:	*crawls out under night shade's bed*
Master9000:	And I'm homr
NightShade:	wb!
SuperGummying:	Okay I'm back
NightShade:	I could go for a nap hour
Luckyskarm:	Ayana, get it together
superheronerd:	I vote for an official nap time hour
Ayana:	​¯\_(ツ)_/¯
superheronerd:	Ayana was also streaming the other day
Luckyskarm:	Anyana's apparently playing music fixed
superheronerd:	Perfect
NightShade:	There's one in there 😛
superheronerd:	I could also use a pillow because I could totally fall over right now
NightShade:	*sends emergency airlift Team Blanket care package*
superheronerd:	That'd be awesome <@!174301934985936896>  you're always coming through 😎
Ayana:	​I supposedly don't have music issues anymore
NightShade:	<@!214587785510780929>  I can send you an emergency blanket package, to make it seem like home
Master9000:	For some reason I'm doubtful of ayana's current playing tag...
superheronerd:	Man I would love to be home right now..
NightShade:	\o/
Luckyskarm:	Gj Eyan.
KingofZeal:	Okey, all new people added to the character pool, now to just organize them all
Aqua033:	I ask dumb questions
Aqua033:	...I know who Oprah is
Aqua033:	Who's Oprah?
Master9000:	You should've started the first statement without bold
Luckyskarm:	**You get a shadow wolf tattoo, YOU get a shadow wolf tattoo, WE ALL GET SHADOW WOLF TATTOOS**
superheronerd:	^
NightShade:	YES
Master9000:	It's the sign of the blanket legion
NightShade:	Just make the entire army have one.
regal swan:	did i? i cant remember
Master9000:	Oh right can you add one for me too <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
superheronerd:	😁
NightShade:	Guilty as charged lmao
Luckyskarm:	Lol
KingofZeal:	I swear to God the number of people who took the shadow wolf tattoo is giving me cancer, lol
Master9000:	You're doing great, especially thru depression but the high control of everything as we all know does slow down progress a little bit
Deino Mite:	Only Eyan gets a cookie cus he's working hard apparently.
NightShade:	I mean... I could go for cookies.
Deino Mite:	Does wittle baby Eyan want a cookie?
regal swan:	we know eyan
NightShade:	You're doing just fine. ^.^
KingofZeal:	Also I don't know why I called myself a kid, I'm not a kid in the slightest anymore, lol
KingofZeal:	Hey now, I'm working as hard as I can.  For a depressed kid, I've done exceptionally well at the very least at actually accomplishing some stuff as of late.  >_<
Deino Mite:	Just like on his YouTube channel.
NightShade:	Gotta have "breaks", right?
Deino Mite:	Once I get pink nu, I'm changing my nickname to imouto-chan
Master9000:	The amount of time you spent distracted would be more than enough to finish by now probably
KingofZeal:	Guys, just sit tight with the discord server, lol.  I'll probably finish hooking this stuff all up on the weekend once I'm good with all my XCom setup
Luckyskarm:	Or pay $5 to get Discord Nitro to get gif pfp
Deino Mite:	Or I can get pink nu
Master9000:	You can pay $5/month on patreon  and change it to whatever you want
Deino Mite:	Eyan, if I make a twitch account called Imouto-chan, can I change my nickname here?
regal swan:	i cant change my username on twitch sad
Master9000:	Eyan still has to hook up enlightened tho
Deino Mite:	So, pink nu?
Master9000:	:keepo
KingofZeal:	I can't do a more toned down color
Master9000:	Sellout and spammer class
NightShade:	Sweet 😄
Master9000:	Yes
KingofZeal:	But that's only because the blue hair is really vibrant
Deino Mite:	Are any of the classes from the level system able to change nickname?
Deino Mite:	Oh
Master9000:	She got it before the rule was written
KingofZeal:	I think it's the blue hair mixed with purple armor that has me thinking it's troll
Deino Mite:	Also, Ida has a different nickname than twitch username.
Master9000:	Deino it is
NightShade:	*had stepped away for a moment*
Deino Mite:	I'm either keeping it at deino mite or making it Imouto-chan
NightShade:	I'm not sure if the Xcom character looking troll is a good or bad thing. xD
Master9000:	Also I prefer deino more
Master9000:	It's not mandatory
Deino Mite:	Guess I have to make a new twitch account.
Deino Mite:	Dang it!
Master9000:	The rule is to match your twitch username only
KingofZeal:	No
KingofZeal:	Most of my most active people though should get into the first starting pool or at the very least the first 5-10 recruits
Master9000:	No
Deino Mite:	<@!162952008712716288> can you change my nickname to Imouto-chan so I can meme Eyan harder?
KingofZeal:	So, I decided I'm just going to directly import everyone from the character pool, so I have a list of people who I have in mind for the starting pool and the first couple recruits, after that, the remaining spots will go to whoever is around to tell me they still need imported, and if nobody's around for that, I'll import at random from who's left in my pool
willofd2011:	Lol
Luckyskarm:	Who will appear tonight on XCom!? Find out
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
KingofZeal:	You can tonight probably
Master9000:	Let's see it
KingofZeal:	Your XCom character is pretty troll looking NightShade
NightShade:	Hey Audiobooks are awesome too 😄
Kugallyblitz:	dont have the hard cover book

regal swan:	i trying to share photos but phone hates me
Kugallyblitz:	and not just normal english
Kugallyblitz:	what sucks is my homework is mainly english
Deino Mite:	You are a mighty brave for daring to take on the challenge of homework, but with enough determination and strength, you can accomplish your quest.
Kugallyblitz:	I have like 5 blisters on one finger and its not too fun
Kugallyblitz:	I GOT DIS >:3
NightShade:	You can do it Blitz 😄
Kugallyblitz:	yeah blisters no fun
Kugallyblitz:	cos for some reason the courses decided to give us 5 essays at the end of the year
Deino Mite:	It's even better cus I have a blister on the bottom of my foot and it hurts cus I've been walking on it all day at school and now I'm finally gonna get to sit down.
Kugallyblitz:	Im on a mission to complete my homework

Master9000:	I can't turn off my bike tread sorry
NightShade:	I need to visit more state parks then.
Master9000:	Yeah state park
Luckyskarm:	I like how you can hear the bike lol
NightShade:	It reminds me of a park.
Deino Mite:	But in glad you like it and it fits into the glorious kingdom of zeal.
NightShade:	<@!162952008712716288> Is this place your biking in some kind of national or state park?
Deino Mite:	I was going for a fantasy vibe and based the coloring of the robe mostly on Robin from fire emblem.
Master9000:	Your imprint has been made clear eyan
Master9000:	
KingofZeal:	And you probably weren't even going for that which makes it all the better
KingofZeal:	10/10
KingofZeal:	It actually has a Zealish vibe believe it or not
NightShade:	Deino, you should frame it and hang it. 😄
KingofZeal:	*wow
KingofZeal:	Oh well, that's actually really cool Deino
Deino Mite:	I was really proud of that painting though cus I spent a lot of time on it and it actually came out well.
Master9000:	This needs to be viewed in 8K to get the full beauty of the field
Deino Mite:	The teacher said no humans.
Master9000:	Why didn't you do that
Master9000:	Humans are animals with human characteristics
Deino Mite:	So I made an owl mage cus I like owls and mages are one of my favorite classes in fantasy games.
Deino Mite:	The prompt was to make a water color painting of an animal with human characteristics.
Master9000:	Upstream
NightShade:	I love it <@191299047896776704> !
Deino Mite:	Why would it be a fox?
Dragonite:	wut
Master9000:	Downflow
Master9000:	Lmao
Deino Mite:	
Dragonite:	technically we're all animals
KingofZeal:	So it's obviously a fox right?
Deino Mite:	It had to be a picture of an animal.
KingofZeal:	rip
Deino Mite:	No
KingofZeal:	Is it a glorious portrait of your King?
Deino Mite:	Anyone want to see I picture of a painting I made for art class?
KingofZeal:	And technically I can get a save file after the first mission with everyone imported to hit the ground running, but that's a bonus at this point.
NightShade:	Good job not getting distracted!
NightShade:	Woohoo, progress!
regal swan:	yay
KingofZeal:	Now to just finish importing the new characters from the survey and I'll be good to go
KingofZeal:	Hoozah, crappy XCom overlay is ready to go
NightShade:	I'll be waiting for pretty water pictures!
NightShade:	\o/
Master9000:	Expect those photos in 5-10
Master9000:	The stream goes on over another nice bridge later on that I'm also gonna go to
Master9000:	Far away shot
NightShade:	I'll get there eventually. xD
NightShade:	I want to take a trip and hit all of the major waterfalls in the US
Master9000:	<@199725993416589313>
Luckyskarm:	Go swimming
NightShade:	I've been to Niagra Falls once. It's very pretty but often very crowded.
KingofZeal:	Waterfalls are indeed quite beautiful, those ones especially
Master9000:	Also Niagra falls is like half an hour away from here
NightShade:	I wanna live near pretty waterfalls D:
NightShade:	O.O

NightShade:	Darth, where do you get such lovely photos?
Master9000:	Lower view of waterfall

Master9000:	As far as I'm aware
Master9000:	Irl
Dragonite:	that's what you think
Master9000:	Also I have never met luckyskarm in my life
SuperGummying:	Brb class
Luckyskarm:	And yet we got married and have 4 kids
SuperGummying:	It went wrong because you two are mean
Dragonite:	it's just that they always were wrong
Dragonite:	it's not that things went wrong
Crow_Songs:	when he tried at all
Luckyskarm:	Where did things go wrong
SuperGummying:	How am I going to leave the house than?
Master9000:	Classic
SuperGummying:	I was afraid of that
Dragonite:	_sets a bucket-on-the-door trap for Gummy_
SuperGummying:	Though I do need to leave the house to visit Bella later
SuperGummying:	You are cool
SuperGummying:	Yeah thanks night shade
Master9000:	I do
Crow_Songs:	*darth calls up a guy*
NightShade:	They won't get in the door. xD
Luckyskarm:	**Darth now needs to pay $350 a month**
Master9000:	The one I had was from the doctor
Dragonite:	_visits anyway_
Master9000:	Lucky this is just a paper with a plus sign on it
SuperGummying:	Dragonite as well
SuperGummying:	Master can't come to visit though
NightShade:	>:O
Master9000:	*eats two cookies at once*
Luckyskarm:	*gave darth the wrong paper, the right paper says positive*
NightShade:	I have cookies from the king himself!
NightShade:	<@!192233330652086272>  Wanna come visit?
SuperGummying:	But I'm not leaving
SuperGummying:	Mother can visit
SuperGummying:	Yes
Master9000:	I KNEW IT
Master9000:	*comes back negative*
Master9000:	*demands a DNA test*
Luckyskarm:	*files for child support*
Luckyskarm:	Wow.
NightShade:	Gummy, is Lucky still okay for you? Lucky could visit.
Master9000:	Cool
SuperGummying:	I'm not leaving night shade's house
Master9000:	You're the one that didn't sign the abortion paper
Master9000:	I don't know what you mean
Luckyskarm:	WHY DO YOU DO THIS
Master9000:	Your home is not being targeted
NightShade:	<@!192233330652086272>  I didn't kidnap him, why is my home being targeted? D:
Master9000:	I already threw him off the waterfall tho
Luckyskarm:	DARTH. Bring him home safely
Master9000:	
NightShade:	*protects Gummy*
Master9000:	
SuperGummying:	Night shade master is hurting me 😭
NightShade:	Pretty waterfall ❤

KingofZeal:	Good
NightShade:	Don't worry, we'll take it outside
KingofZeal:	Hey hey hey, no burning the place down
Dragonite:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Luckyskarm:	Why do you have flamethrowers?
NightShade:	*accepts flamethrower*
NightShade:	\o/
Dragonite:	_hands out free flamethrowers_
NightShade:	\o/ Another pyro!
Crow_Songs:	ILL KOIN THE PYRO PARTY
NightShade:	<@!192233330652086272>  Don't worry. I'll make him eat one first
NightShade:	The internet here is actually very good. Since I live in a house with 6 people who all game, we pitched in to pay for really good internet
KingofZeal:	A king would never risk poison in food he plans to also eat himself
SuperGummying:	Yay
Luckyskarm:	What if he poisoned them Night?
KingofZeal:	This is true
Dragonite:	"How's your WiFi?"
NightShade:	How could I turn down cookies?
Dragonite:	The real question is
NightShade:	OOH COOKIES
Dragonite:	Eyan
NightShade:	Gummy, I gave you entry. You're ok
KingofZeal:	I'll bring cookies
KingofZeal:	I dunno, can you invite me?
SuperGummying:	Wait I'm in your house
NightShade:	😛
NightShade:	That depends. Did you come in uninvited?
KingofZeal:	You wouldn't hit me now would you?
Dragonite:	So someone else gets to beat you up today, it looks like
Dragonite:	_looks at Gummy_
NightShade:	If someone is in my house, I'm hitting them with my quarterstaff
Luckyskarm:	Come home Gummy
KingofZeal:	Very carefully
SuperGummying:	Do something
SuperGummying:	Night shade he's going to burn me
NightShade:	<@!162952008712716288>  How did you get in my house?
Master9000:	So you won't mind if we burn this one and get you a newer better one

NightShade:	I will set ALL the things on fire!
NightShade:	<@!304073163669766158>  I like fire!
Master9000:	Why not
KingofZeal:	Seriously though, why are you keeping the area under that bed on fire, you never know when somebody will stick a fire hose under there
NightShade:	...Ah dang it. xD
Dragonite:	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
KingofZeal:	*raises eyebrow*  Important things eyy?
NightShade:	*gives <@!192233330652086272>  a cookie*
Luckyskarm:	*cries*
NightShade:	Gummy aside, I need that stuff. xD
SuperGummying:	*hides behind night shade*

Dragonite:	_sticks a fire hose under night shade's bed and turns it on_
SuperGummying:	*hides under night shade's bed*
NightShade:	Sorry <@!192233330652086272> . If I force him, he'll just run away again.
SuperGummying:	No no pls don't
NightShade:	<@199725993416589313>  Are you ready to go home, Gummy?
Dragonite:	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Dragonite:	nobody knows who i am, either
Luckyskarm:	<@199725993416589313> come home

SuperGummying:	Bella is my sister?
NightShade:	<@!304073163669766158>  It's going to take forever to actually get my account to 30. I never finished leveling it.
Luckyskarm:	Gummy, why are you going to your sisters house?
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> so are we doing fan games tonight as well or is that a fut- oh ok

Master9000:	*screenshots* ok
SuperGummying:	Master I'll give you $5 of you do 5 push ups
Necro:	I'm horrid with motors and transformers tho since at first I wasn't enrolled in the class so I missed 5 weeks of info and had to play catch up
Master9000:	Yours actually looks useful tho <@161610812715171841>
NightShade:	Ooh
Necro:	<@162952008712716288> at least your assignment sounds interesting cause this is on of electromagnetic principles
Master9000:	
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Master9000 leveled up!**
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> is the treason post policy consistent with that of the kingdom?
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	Distract him

NightShade:	HA. Everyone, DISTRACT HIM
regal swan:	lol bye
Master9000:	Keep distracting him
KingofZeal:	Damnit, I let you guys distract me again.  I'm out of here or else I'll never be prepped for tonight's stream, see ya'll
superheronerd:	Book things over summer are the most annoying things
Master9000:	Biostatistics being like the average effect of something on a population?
NightShade:	Forced reading. Interesting
Necro:	Interesting and sounds very enjoyable
Master9000:	
Master9000:	My summer assignment? This shit
NightShade:	So that class is going to bring a lot of those two things together
NightShade:	I love biostatistics and genetics
NightShade:	My summer course? Population Genetics
Master9000:	I did a lot better on the ap final that I felt I would
Necro:	What's your course on <@174301934985936896>
NightShade:	<@161610812715171841>  I'm having a similar problem. I'm not sure exactly what I'll do, though I have a few ideas floating around
NightShade:	I'm excited for it
Necro:	What's annoying is that I can do the work and understand the points I'm just lazy and lethargic as all hell and I don't really know what I want to be after completing the 4 years of the course
NightShade:	But now that Cell Bio is over, I can focus on my summer class that looks interesting. 😄
willofd2011:	I remember having an English teacher back in high school who failed at least half of her students in one semester
NightShade:	I'm sure I'll be in that boat as I finish out 400 level courses
willofd2011:	Wow O.o
KingofZeal:	Can't remember if I failed a second final or not
KingofZeal:	But yes, I failed a final or two uncurved, but one of those classes was so unbelievably hard that almost everyone failed it without the curve.  That class wasn't graded normally
NightShade:	Mwuhahaha, Team Blanket is slowly reassembling once more!
SuperGummying:	Hello blanket buddy night shade 😋
willofd2011:	Idk just go with the flow lol
NightShade:	^
KingofZeal:	Don't worry about it

NightShade:	Whelp
KingofZeal:	lol
SuperGummying:	Hey guys
KingofZeal:	Oh, I guess I'm just the perv then
NightShade:	I took it as before a curve, you did fail one.
NightShade:	I wasn't even thinking of it in pervy terms until you said something. But now I am, thanks. xD
regal swan:	het i am not
KingofZeal:	I'm convinced everyone here is a perv, I blame Rain for this
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Uhhuh *stares*
NightShade:	"When accounting for any curves" 😛
KingofZeal:	Interestingly enough, I never failed a final when accounting for any curves
Necro:	Well I always have the resit paper if it comes to that
willofd2011:	True
NightShade:	It depends how you did the rest of the semester
Luckyskarm:	Grats on lvling
NightShade:	You can fail the final and still pass in my school
NightShade:	o.o Ouch, that sucks Necro
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **NightShade leveled up!**
NightShade:	I sat down, received my test, and just cracked a large grin. It wasn't -easy-, but it also wasn't as painful as the previous exams have been.
Necro:	Final for the entire course so I don't pass it I don't compete the course <@174301934985936896>
willofd2011:	My day is doing great so far thank you lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	I always liked finals which turn out far easier than expected.  Granted, who wouldn't
NightShade:	Necro, is a graded unit test something like a midterm or a final?
And yes, yes I did. It wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.
KingofZeal:	Did you survive said finals?  😛
Necro:	Just had my graded unit test if I've pasted it would be Just scraping by
NightShade:	Aloha! I'm celebrating the end of my finals. \o/ How're you?
Necro:	How's everyone doing today

NightShade:	I honestly prefer Discord as a communication tool.
Luckyskarm:	I've used Skype once at most, never liked it tbh
SuperGummying:	I mean business
SuperGummying:	What er
Master9000:	bullshit business excuse lol
SuperGummying:	Than again I shouldn't be reading over old msgs
Master9000:	WHAT DID WE JUST TALK ABOUT
SuperGummying:	Yeah tbh Skype makes me depressed
Master9000:	but worth it so far right?
Neon Strike Kitty:	>Gummy being cool
KingofZeal:	Doing a full life re-boot is quite a taxing process >_<
NightShade:	*nod* There are some people from my Skyping days that I don't have to see anymore either. It's a relief
SuperGummying:	Me being cool
SuperGummying:	You missed um
SuperGummying:	Wb ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm back, btw
Neon Strike Kitty:	Skype is kind of awful
KingofZeal:	I stopped using skype as soon as this server was functional, and I question why I stuck with it for so long.  I know why I did, because of connections to a lot of people, but it's so liberating to not have to look at half those names anymore.
SuperGummying:	I only have it around for business
NightShade:	My computer gets angry if I try to use Skype
SuperGummying:	Lol
SuperGummying:	No
Luckyskarm:	People still use Skype?

NightShade:	Er... * 10 - 12
NightShade:	But hopefully that will be fixed in 100-12 business days!
Master9000:	nah that cant be it
superheronerd:	The blankets will help immensely 😎
NightShade:	Admittedly it's probably the source of my headaches
KingofZeal:	I'd imagine wearing 5 year old glasses also probably doesn't help
NightShade:	*piles more blankets on Bella* SLEEEEEEEP
NightShade:	Bella, if you can't move, sleep. Team Blanket needs strong members D:
SuperGummying:	Bella maybe you should sleep
NightShade:	According to them: My eyes are bad. xD
Dragonite:	nice
NightShade:	I just realized I still had health insurance, so I had an eye exam yesterday
Master9000:	too much
Master9000:	or you just dont mess them up
superheronerd:	Thanks.
I am actually unable to move. So, that's fun
KingofZeal:	Oh God bless your soul
Dragonite:	_does something_
NightShade:	Nope. Those are the pair I use every day
SuperGummying:	Unless Dragonite decides to do something
KingofZeal:	5 year old scratched beyond belief glasses?  I sure hope you have something newer than that, lol
SuperGummying:	Don't worry I can cover for Bella as well
NightShade:	*pats Bella* Rest. I think I can. :3
Master9000:	now if only it was rea
SuperGummying:	*gives Bella chocolate* here this will make you feel better
NightShade:	Here, borrow my 5 year old scratched beyond belief glasses and tell me if those help
Master9000:	can you hear the colors tho?
Aqua033:	Not even my own car is safe
superheronerd:	Nightshade, you must take over for me while I feel like this.
KingofZeal:	I should probably get my eyes checked then
Aqua033:	Nowhere is safe from that
Aqua033:	God dammit
NightShade:	...Or that
NightShade:	Because it's THE TASTE YOU CAN SEE
Master9000:	because cannibalism
KingofZeal:	But does the Internet know why kids love cinnamon toast crunch
NightShade:	Sometimes it's temperamental, but overall it's good.
SuperGummying:	Mine sucks though
NightShade:	But the internet does wonderful things
SuperGummying:	No
Dragonite:	be nice to the internet
SuperGummying:	Okay stupid internet
Dragonite:	_wraps Gummy up in a blanket and puts him in time-out for breaking the rules_
Master9000:	only if you stop spewing bullshti
Dragonite:	the only artillery we have here is pillows and blankets, good sir
SuperGummying:	I need you for artillery
Master9000:	did i ever stop???
NightShade:	Update: I am too lazy to build a trebuchet at this time.
SuperGummying:	Master are you willing to be my marshal again?
Dragonite:	why thank you
KingofZeal:	That's an interesting quote you have there
NightShade:	HA! My words cannot be repeated!
Master9000:	depends on what you fill them with
Dragonite:	also this is my new favorite out-of-context quote: 
god damn it it isn't pasting
NightShade:	I wonder if I could build a trebuchet out of things in my room... hmm...
KingofZeal:	Weaponized pillows aren't particularly effective though
Master9000:	my school has one
NightShade:	I have seen weaponized pillows
Dragonite:	i made it out of blankets
Master9000:	not yet
NightShade:	Where on earth did you get a trebuchet Dragonite?
KingofZeal:	Pillows are not for warfare
Dragonite:	_loads a bunch of pillows into a trebuchet and flings them over the wall_
SuperGummying:	We are at war
SuperGummying:	Guys pick up your muskets and horses
Dragonite:	_declares war on Gummy anyway_
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you can't declare war on me if I have allies
Aqua033:	tfw I was having ping issues because I was updating a game in the background

Dragonite:	_builds a fortress out of blankets and pillows and goes to war against Gummy_

SuperGummying:	Sorry, we were unable to connect to chat. Reconnecting in 2 seconds.
SuperGummying:	So it told me I can't connect to chat
SuperGummying:	Yeah but I kept sending more
cadance:	To prevent copy paste spam
cadance:	Twitch only allows 1 message per second and if you send faster than that you get that message saying "you are sending messages too fast" or something
SuperGummying:	I blame Eyan's moobot
SuperGummying:	I don't remember how many I sent
cadance:	And it's only 24 hours
SuperGummying:	Close enough
cadance:	A) not possible to do that, b) 30 messages in 30 seconds triggers global ban
SuperGummying:	So it activated a twitch global ban where if I'm on my internet I can't talk on twitch until the fan is over
SuperGummying:	So I spam in the chat like 40 words in 10 sec
SuperGummying:	I got ban for spamming in Eyan's chat even though I put .... and was ban for 10 minutes
Neon Strike Kitty:	What?
SuperGummying:	Ida I was ban because it's was dumb
Neon Strike Kitty:	It may need to involve time travel
Neon Strike Kitty:	If it's unbanning, my price is not doing the thing that got you banned in the first place
SuperGummying:	😈
SuperGummying:	Everyone will pay
KingofZeal:	I don't have to pay anything right?  <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	My price depends
Aqua033:	A small loan of a million dollars <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Try me
SuperGummying:	I can't 😋
Aqua033:	I can prob be bought by certain people
SuperGummying:	I think I'm still global ban on twitch
regal swan:	i just going to watch twitch now
KingofZeal:	Everyone has a price
SuperGummying:	What if you are him in disguise?
SuperGummying:	Are you sure?
KingofZeal:	I like to think I'm not somebody who can be bought, but let's be real, I probably can be bought
cadance:	Ptch I'm not Anthony <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	#sellout
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not if he bribes Eyan enough
SuperGummying:	Lol you're going to get ban one day for real
cadance:	He's still a prude though <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Something like that
cadance:	He knows I'm kidding I respect what he tells me not to do
Neon Strike Kitty:	*banned*
cadance:	And Eyan it's not my fault you're a prude <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	I don't have my computer so I have to use my phone but I only check it once every 10 mins or so unless I'm actively engaged in a conversation
Neon Strike Kitty:	Cadance is probably dancing
Aqua033:	Sorry about that
SuperGummying:	Oh wait he's offline
SuperGummying:	Someone should tell cadance that
SuperGummying:	Kk
KingofZeal:	I'm not mad in the slightest
KingofZeal:	I don't need anybody apologizing, just letting you all know let's not do that again.   😛
SuperGummying:	But I kinda contributed a bit to it that's why I apologize
KingofZeal:	But that's more a difference of opinion, he's more open about the particular topic than I wish to be
SuperGummying:	Yeah it was kinda crossing it
KingofZeal:	Nah, not your fault, Cadance was the one who probably started crossing lines tbh
SuperGummying:	Sorry Eyan
regal swan:	no i may have started it blitz knows wut i talking about
KingofZeal:	Unless it's for what I striked out <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	You weren't the one having the conversation, lol, not sure why you're apologizing
regal swan:	sorry
KingofZeal:	Eyan's making the executive decision that the conversations that were had while I was painting are probably a little too far in terms of crossing lines of what should be permitted in this chat.  ~~Then again, that might just be because I'm not getting laid any time soon.~~
SuperGummying:	Dragonite and me have amazing conversations
SuperGummying:	Feel better Bella
Deino Mite:	you and gummy
Deino Mite:	we can only have interesting conversations because you werent here
Dragonite:	that was a very interesting convesrsation i just napped through
superheronerd:	So, I think I'm running a fever. I'll be off
superheronerd:	Never mind
SuperGummying:	Animal thing?
superheronerd:	Not the animal thing
superheronerd:	<@199725993416589313>
Deino Mite:	animals that mate for life
superheronerd:	I have no idea what you're talking about
Deino Mite:	thats pretty interesting
SuperGummying:	I got the money and gun?
SuperGummying:	What
superheronerd:	I have learned a thing today
cadance:	Wow more than I thought
cadance:	Voles, skinks, gibbons
cadance:	Apparently cranes and swans, as well as the bald eagle
cadance:	Certain wolves are
cadance:	Penguins for sure, hence Happy Feet
cadance:	I could be wrong but I believe most whales are
Deino Mite:	i actually cant think of any others off the top of my head
cadance:	Very few species are life partners
cadance:	Although humans didn't used to be life partners like we are now
Deino Mite:	ya
cadance:	Set marriage as the standard
cadance:	Some religion anyway
cadance:	Fair enough, though iirc premarital sex was quite common until Judaism came about
Deino Mite:	but the stuff i mentioned above was an actual region
Deino Mite:	that too
cadance:	There's also the fact that life expectancy was much lower so if you apply the same ratios we actually marry around the same age as we used to
Deino Mite:	no
superheronerd:	No.
SuperGummying:	Bella you agree with me right?
SuperGummying:	Hey war is fun though
superheronerd:	Dang it <@199725993416589313>
Deino Mite:	one of the reasons a lot of ancient civilizations married at such a young age is because sexual desires begin to awaken during puberty so by having people marry then, it allows for them to satisfy sexual desires
cadance:	Yes kill everyone to ensure survival
SuperGummying:	And bayonets
SuperGummying:	Muskets
SuperGummying:	Lots of it
SuperGummying:	War
SuperGummying:	Tbh if you want to ensure the survival of our species do it my way
SuperGummying:	Yes I know
cadance:	That's what leveled me up? Tatsu likes sex apparently <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm asexual
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **cadance leveled up!**
cadance:	Sex is the basic function of all living creatures, biologically speaking we exist for one reason and one reason only: to create a new generation and ensure the survival of the species
SuperGummying:	For me
SuperGummying:	This stuff is not necessary
Neon Strike Kitty:	It took several tries to get that result
superheronerd:	I always miss the fun conversations.
SuperGummying:	I mean Is
Neon Strike Kitty:	I had a prophet tell me I'm dying alone and unloved
SuperGummying:	Er I mean not the point
cadance:	Don't worry gummy you'll find someone some day <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	I rather not though
SuperGummying:	Okay this is um interesting
cadance:	So pretty much if both people are in high school they can screw
Neon Strike Kitty:	not sure
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think here it's 15 if the other person is 18 or younger
cadance:	*how to silence an entire chat 101*
cadance:	State laws are fascinating
cadance:	The "average" age of consent is 16, with a limit on how much older the other person can be (for example in Colorado, if you are 14 or 15 you can consent with someone up to 4 years older than you, 16 or 17 you can consent to someone up to 10 years older) but some states you can't legally consent until 18 no matter how old your partner is.
SuperGummying:	Master I'll give you $25
SuperGummying:	It's normal watch
Aqua033:	^
Master9000:	Just a normal*
Master9000:	€^|> abnormal family friendly conversation
Aqua033:	"Normal"
SuperGummying:	Yup normal
Neon Strike Kitty:	Right, just a normal conversation
Aqua033:	In most US states, the age of consent is 16, but there are certain restrictions on the person until they're 18 iirc
Neon Strike Kitty:	What did I leak in on?
Master9000:	Ignoring all the other crazy shit, Isn't the legal age only 17
Neon Strike Kitty:	*leaks into the chat*
Deino Mite:	because google would be a fantastic waifu
Zaranius:	Why is this a thing?
Zaranius:	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAAqqthU0AAcstn.jpg
SuperGummying:	In French
SuperGummying:	Start singing the anthem
SuperGummying:	Blitz
Kugallyblitz:	how to tell if someone is delusional
You are delusional
"No I am not"
Yes you are
"I am not delusional because I am not delusional"
SuperGummying:	~~Wait I'm surprised you guys bought that cover up~~
SuperGummying:	No you are
Deino Mite:	gummy you are delusional
Kugallyblitz:	LOL
SuperGummying:	This is my new national anthem
SuperGummying:	https://youtu.be/PIQSEq6tEVs
SuperGummying:	Here I'll show everyone
Kugallyblitz:	uh huh
SuperGummying:	Now you do
Kugallyblitz:	i think so idk
SuperGummying:	Wait you do know what I'm talking about?
SuperGummying:	Oh well you know what it is
Kugallyblitz:	guess i do
Kugallyblitz:	huh
SuperGummying:	Wait it's not really secret than 🤔
SuperGummying:	Blitz you know what it is
Kugallyblitz:	oh boy
SuperGummying:	I can't stop smiling at it
SuperGummying:	Super top secret
SuperGummying:	Is my secret plan
SuperGummying:	The only think that's making me happy
Kugallyblitz:	but that's my take on it
Kugallyblitz:	then again, I believe in living by what makes you happy, if you have sex every weekend and not married, or don't have sex at all, but you are happy and it's not harming anyone you know, go right ahead. Though I don't know why I used that as an example lol
SuperGummying:	And when you accidentally get girl or get pregnant good luck
cadance:	
cadance:	Accurately
cadance:	But I think this picture actively sums it up
cadance:	Yeah aqua the thing is we are still friends so every day is torture for me
Aqua033:	Well, so long as you love the person.
Aqua033:	Personally, I believe that, if you wanna have sex, have sex.
Deino Mite:	here. have a reddit post of funny stuff: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6bom9w/what_was_the_incident_at_your_school/
Deino Mite:	ya lets stop being depressing
Deino Mite:	i guess i understand that, but i still dont think sex is ok outside of marriage. we live in a liberal society though so what can i do other than stick by my morals myself
Aqua033:	...This got depressing fast.
Aqua033:	Because she was his motivation to live.
Aqua033:	It really screwed him up
Aqua033:	And one day she just stopped talking to him
Aqua033:	They were always the closest to this one girl
Aqua033:	Also, that's kinda how one of my friends feels rn Cadance
Kugallyblitz:	then again if it doesn't work out with one girl that may be a sign she really isn't the one and there's someone better
Aqua033:	Yessir.
cadance:	But yeah I seriously wanted to be with this girl or i wouldn't have had sex with her, like I even started feeling attached to her daughter, like I babysat for her and everything and kinda was thinking like "what if she asks me to be this kid's step dad one day" and we were doing so much stuff together like I thought we had something real and then... yeah. Just rip me right
SuperGummying:	So aqua I'm the guy with the money....and the GUN, when I say go out on a date with me...YOU GO
Aqua033:	I'm devoted to a smol girl about half a mile away, and a smol girl a state down
SuperGummying:	Fine aqua pretend to be a girl
Deino Mite:	hey master, can you make my nickname on here "Imouto-chan" for the memes
Deino Mite:	dont do it on me. im devoted to onii-chan
Aqua033:	Or am I? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Aqua you are not a girl
Aqua033:	Ohh, ohh! Me, me!
SuperGummying:	So who should I test it on?
SuperGummying:	^
Aqua033:	You mean right reasons
cadance:	For the wrong reasons
Deino Mite:	thats a good way to get on the news
SuperGummying:	"I'm the guy with the money....and the GUN" "when I say go out on a date with me...YOU GO"
Deino Mite:	dont listen to gummy's dating advice
Deino Mite:	no
SuperGummying:	Do it my way
SuperGummying:	Also if you are like me and wanna ask someone out
SuperGummying:	Like the old days
SuperGummying:	Go on a real date
SuperGummying:	Ignore that stuff for now
SuperGummying:	My belief is
Deino Mite:	i understand a lot of people see it that way, but because of my personal beliefs, it makes me sad that so many do
cadance:	So I figure screw it, it feels good for both parties so why not have some fun
SuperGummying:	This is interesting
SuperGummying:	Okay.....
cadance:	I never thought of it that way until the only girl I have had sex with told me she only did it because we're friends and she wanted me to feel more comfortable putting myself out there, then chose to be with a guy twice her age and utterly destroyed my heart
Deino Mite:	it should be a much more important decision and it should be saved until after marriage, but so few people in our society see it that way these days
Deino Mite:	and thats what disappoints me
Deino Mite:	i know
Aqua033:	For some people, it is
Aqua033:	I mean, to be fair
Deino Mite:	that so many people treat "getting laid" as something so frivolous.
cadance:	lol why's that
Deino Mite:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768> society really disappoints me sometimes
cadance:	She actually asked me several times a few months ago but I was so invested in someone else that I said no
cadance:	Unless she changes her mind by then but I doubt she will
cadance:	Her flashing me was a "promise" or something, so yeah getting laid
Deino Mite:	what about the part about getting laid?
cadance:	No kappa, happened on my way home from work
Aqua033:	Cadance is getting laid?
Deino Mite:	is that a kappa or no kappa
Kugallyblitz:	mhm
cadance:	Just wish it was a different girl y'know
cadance:	Well I got a girl to flash me last night and I'm getting laid on Saturday so not too bad there
Kugallyblitz:	ooh, well I hope you're doing well overall cadance
cadance:	I'm not up to much. Trying to make a life for myself, fighting depression for sorta similar reasons as Eyan
Aqua033:	<@!162952008712716288> ESO is Elder Scrolls Online
Kugallyblitz:	imagine if your brain actually got bigger with more information stored
willofd2011:	XD
Kugallyblitz:	so what are you up to cadance
Kugallyblitz:	I was hoping you'd put a kappa there xD
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	Like an attic
cadance:	But your brain needs to get bigger the more information you store
cadance:	What
Kugallyblitz:	that's right
Deino Mite:	brain size =/= intelligence
Kugallyblitz:	pretty cool i guess
Kugallyblitz:	My brain almost weight 4.5 pounds. 😮 like 4.44 pounds
Kugallyblitz:	they are like 3% of your body weight
Kugallyblitz:	Learned a fun fact about brains the other day
regal swan:	trying to burn my brain
Kugallyblitz:	I just poured myself a soda cos I'm all about that healthy stuff
willofd2011:	And you guys? Lol ^w^
willofd2011:	Nothing much just trying to figure out what to do now lol
Kugallyblitz:	what are you up to
willofd2011:	Hiya lol ^w^
Kugallyblitz:	hello will
Kugallyblitz:	not
Kugallyblitz:	Eyan would be proud
willofd2011:	Lol
regal swan:	it was grosss
regal swan:	no
Kugallyblitz:	oh boy
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	Pm me, not in chat
cadance:	Sounds hot, screenshot pls
regal swan:	all ik is man with tentcles putting them all over a womans body
Kugallyblitz:	🤔
regal swan:	if thats possible
regal swan:	i think hentai but not in anime?
Kugallyblitz:	ooh what happened
regal swan:	well that was the most uncomfrotable scence ever
Kugallyblitz:	christ I need more sleep
Kugallyblitz:	jessus I can type
Kugallyblitz:	ey yi yi, well, the after look will be worth it lol. Idk about you but a make over on something like color changing  makes it look cooler to me, it's boring looking at one color for that amount of time
wolverale12:	Are you painting happy little trees on your walls?
KingofZeal:	Not really, it's a pain in the rear and it needs done cause it hasn't been done in 20 years
Kugallyblitz:	well the process may not be fun, but I'm fond of places all of the sudden changin color
Kugallyblitz:	ooh that sounds cool
Kugallyblitz:	lol jk
Kugallyblitz:	Nah Kugal gets it, Eyan is an artist <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	You know how the walls in my room are the vivid blue?  I'm doubling up with my dad to paint our kitchen and living room that color
KingofZeal:	I think you misunderstand what painting I'm doing, lol
Deino Mite:	masterpiece
Kugallyblitz:	how do we know you're not painting a spot in the sky where there are currently no clouds?
KingofZeal:	https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2c/da/5c/2cda5c3e044d95dfac26e33dac17c5d5.jpg
Kugallyblitz:	well what color are you currently using
KingofZeal:	No, pretty sure there is an  enormous difference, lol
Kugallyblitz:	still same thing p[retty much
KingofZeal:	I wish I could paint pictures
Kugallyblitz:	oh
KingofZeal:	Painting walls, not pictures, lol
wolverale12:	sound wonderful eyan
Kugallyblitz:	whoa you paint?
wolverale12:	dying and painting huh?
KingofZeal:	But mostly dying
Kugallyblitz:	there's a zoo tycoon game?
KingofZeal:	And painting
Kugallyblitz:	dying sounds fun
wolverale12:	nothing much, just working on zoo tycoon 1 projects
KingofZeal:	Dying
Kugallyblitz:	what are you guys up to
KingofZeal:	Perhaps
Deino Mite:	Yandere?
Kugallyblitz:	Howdy everyone
KingofZeal:	Inb4 confessing to your crush is what kills you
Deino Mite:	Either way, I would try to find a way to prevent myself from dying. If I eventually came to terms with the fact that there was nothing I could do to prevent my death, then I would confess to my crush and try to live the day so I would have as few regrets as possible.
KingofZeal:	Pretty much, although I think today in particular, I've pretty much just straight up lost my mind
regal swan:	in some way
regal swan:	all youtubers are crazy
regal swan:	no just sayin
KingofZeal:	You only now noticed?  lol
regal swan:	yep eyans gone mad
KingofZeal:	Fish sticks
SuperGummying:	Lol
SuperGummying:	I win
Deino Mite:	even if it is no win, i still would try as hard as possible to find a way around it, before finally excepting the conditions that there is no winning choice and finding the best solution
Deino Mite:	i mean like admitting defeat in a no win scenario
Deino Mite:	nope
SuperGummying:	Admit I won
Deino Mite:	im the kind of person that almost never admits defeat
Deino Mite:	i would probably find a way around it
KingofZeal:	Something like that
regal swan:	have fun?
KingofZeal:	Welp, back to painting I go
Master9000:	But basically being given the information causes the death
Master9000:	I didn't have time to read over the message
regal swan:	a bit?
Master9000:	Siri using voice to text it's a little bit weird
Master9000:	Some people would do some overlap still shouldn't try to go as crazy as they possibly can winding up to having the rusty because of the time traveler
KingofZeal:	But it's not as if I'd be making any effort to stop it
KingofZeal:	Eh, I mean, indirectly I suppose I'm playing it safe
KingofZeal:	I hate to be a downer today, but the brain is just not functioning right today.  >_<
Master9000:	What you said does kind of avoid in theory By  just playing safe
KingofZeal:	Years ago, I probably would have went the "try to avoid it" route
KingofZeal:	Nah, I think it runs with the depression.  I certainly wouldn't have had an answer like that years ago
Master9000:	Does that run in your family?
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I'd just kind of accept it and be like whatever
Master9000:	It's my new favorite paradox because most people will try to figure it out and ultimately lead to their own demise in  doing so while others may super map out what's gonna happen and manage to avoid it
regal swan:	eh
KingofZeal:	Considering you're the one who's about to drop dead, lol
KingofZeal:	That's sweet, although I would imagine it should be the other way around on who's giving who the best day possible
regal swan:	i would marry my boyfriend and give him the best day possible
KingofZeal:	And maybe rewatch one of my favorite animes
KingofZeal:	If I was 100% certain it was a true statement, probably just sit around playing video games
Master9000:	What would you do if a time traveler appeared in front of you and told you that you would die tomorrow with zero detail beyond that?
KingofZeal:	I feel like I'm about to collapse under stress and the only thing that's keeping me from collapsing is by working, thus applying more stress
KingofZeal:	At this point, I wouldn't be suprised
Master9000:	Level 26 and also oh no Eyan's half life he's gonna die in his mid 40s
KingofZeal:	I'm on painting break, and also half dead
KingofZeal:	Ooh, level 16
KingofZeal:	Cool story bro
Master9000:	In some situations it's better than assuming but that is more of making sure you don't make any mistakes as opposed to wondering about if ands or buts
KingofZeal:	I've watched madoka magica far too many times >_<
regal swan:	riight
KingofZeal:	curiosity is illogical
regal swan:	just
regal swan:	not important was hust curoius
Master9000:	I would call it a short series
KingofZeal:	Although, I question why it's so important for you to know if it's a "mini" series, lol
regal swan:	eh it close enough
KingofZeal:	I suppose it also depends on how many episodes a season.  If it's like, 4 episode seasons, I'd say yeah, anything above probably 8-10, I'd probably say no
regal swan:	40 min episodes
Master9000:	Probably depends on episode length or something of that sort
regal swan:	is a series conserided mini if it has 2 short seasons?
Master9000:	Wtf is ESO
Aqua033:	Why the hell does ESO take so long to download
Master9000:	And would probably jut have white background for when it's off
Master9000:	A very futuristic house with glass walls that you can choose the color of, might be a bit too bright for a room unless u want to get rid of the light source
Master9000:	That gives me an idea
willofd2011:	True
KingofZeal:	There was a whole pallet of silverish colors, we decided on that one.  Keep in mind, you're not seeing the whole room, colors and shades are largely dependent on a multitude of factors
Master9000:	I wish I could quit like that and just focus on making the damn review chart I've made no progress on in a few months
regal swan:	i tried a game of league but that suck so i was like back to youtube
Master9000:	Were there other options or did they specifically want this one?
willofd2011:	How are you guys doing ^w^
KingofZeal:	Mind you, the color choice wasn't exactly mine to make, although I did agree with my parents in the end
regal swan:	hi will
Master9000:	That's just the vibe I'm getting from that color
willofd2011:	Hai friends ^w^
Master9000:	Feels a bit melancholy
KingofZeal:	Also, I too love silver, thus the whole skarmory thing, lol
regal swan:	cool
KingofZeal:	This is the exact color https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2c/da/5c/2cda5c3e044d95dfac26e33dac17c5d5.jpg
regal swan:	i love silver
KingofZeal:	Mind you, this is a room that has historically been kept close to white, so we're not painting it any fancy colors
KingofZeal:	It's not this color, but it's similar to it.  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/5f/6f/44/5f6f4412fafacfc6ccf8e52c75c7436f.jpg
KingofZeal:	A light silver with the slightest, and I do mean slightest, tint of blue in it.
Master9000:	What color are you painting the room?
SuperGummying:	You can do it Eyan 👍
KingofZeal:	But thanks everyone, I'll push through it this time.  I won't let it beat me.
KingofZeal:	I was hoping painting would keep my spirits up, but I'm just feeling super burned today.  It's funny, cause last night on stream, I was talking about how I'd been doing good lately in terms of depression.
SuperGummying:	Feel better Eyan
cadance:	Trust me Eyan I can relate
regal swan:	hope her and lux switching
regal swan:	nami top? really?
regal swan:	welp
regal swan:	hope you feel better eyan
Animal_Glue_:	yey don't kill me pls
Kireina:	hoh boi its lit XCOM 2 \o>
Master9000:	You got this Eyan
Dragonite:	(っ◕‿◕)っ
KingofZeal:	Nothing like the feeling of depression as it tries to latch onto you and drag you down as you get your day moving.  v_v
SuperGummying:	The army doesn't listen to you
Master9000:	*army guns down gummy*

superheronerd:	Me too, actually. 😎
Kugallyblitz:	thats what
Kugallyblitz:	I'm hella excited
Kireina:	SoCal
superheronerd:	No
superheronerd:	Panda, north, mid or SoCal
SuperGummying:	Bella wanna come to Canada
superheronerd:	I really want blankets and to do nothing. He about you
Master9000:	its 20 ish here rn
Kireina:	I moved from Illinois to California and must say I died the first few years I moved out here
Kugallyblitz:	and everyone
Kugallyblitz:	how are you doin
Kugallyblitz:	howdy bella
Kugallyblitz:	now it barely goes over 80 or so
superheronerd:	Hey blitz!
Kugallyblitz:	I remember where I lived anything in the high 90s was considered normal
superheronerd:	And that's why I would be slightly miserable
SuperGummying:	That's like hot for Canada
superheronerd:	How strange
superheronerd:	70's in the summer here are considered cold
Kireina:	I need to consider living in Canada for the summers
Kireina:	That is considered warm 👌
Kireina:	That's some nice ass weather <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
Kireina:	Wot
SuperGummying:	I'm used to my 22 degrees Celsius in the summer
SuperGummying:	Welp that's hot
Kireina:	*has 0 idea how metric system works*
superheronerd:	38, it seems
Kireina:	30 something celsius?
Kireina:	probably like
SuperGummying:	But imma say very hot
SuperGummying:	Yeah i have no clue how hot that is here
superheronerd:	_looks at predicted summer heat of 100+ and shrugs_
Kireina:	and this because why not (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
SuperGummying:	Gummy is a complainer
Kireina:	I mean I can't either, but I can at least withstand more than that without complaining
superheronerd:	For context it is 64 degrees here and I'm sad
SuperGummying:	I can't stand the heat
Kireina:	wot
SuperGummying:	65 Fahrenheit
Kireina:	which tends to not actually be hot, but sticky and annoying
SuperGummying:	18 degrees Celsius
Kireina:	so I can only imagine humid hot
Kireina:	It's Canada
Kireina:	How hot is it GumGum 🤔
superheronerd:	_frowns at the lack of warmth_
regal swan:	here too
SuperGummying:	It's hot here 😓
Kireina:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
superheronerd:	I'll be alright 😁 thanks for the concern though. I made sure to bundle up today
Kireina:	I would suggest waiting in a class or even the hallway, but idk how long it takes to get to the bus stop
superheronerd:	And I am just out of class
superheronerd:	Just a long bus wait. Every hour
Kireina:	Also I hope you're at least wearing gloves whilst typing to us
Kireina:	rip did you miss the bus? or is it just a long wait time between buses? <:Thonk:281612113485627392>
SuperGummying:	I question why it's cold there but not cold here 🤔
superheronerd:	Wait for my bus home
Kireina:	why?
Kireina:	oh
superheronerd:	I have to wait outside for 30 more minutes
Kireina:	I don't see anything wrong with these statements
superheronerd:	I have a cold, and it is cold outside
Kireina:	Being insane is subjective
Kireina:	I mean
Kugallyblitz:	oh ok
SuperGummying:	*points at master*
Kugallyblitz:	what made you come to this conclusion
SuperGummying:	I'm insane
Kugallyblitz:	lol so whats up with you guys
Kugallyblitz:	🤔
SuperGummying:	https://youtu.be/tQGdV1eS64w
SuperGummying:	Hmmm nvm there isn't a ....in day
Kugallyblitz:	Hai will and friendos

SuperGummying:	Remember all it takes is one bad...day
Master9000:	all the times
SuperGummying:	I'm just a little insane at times
Master9000:	doubtful
SuperGummying:	No I'm not
Master9000:	hes a lost cause lol
superheronerd:	Also it's a really interesting idea (:
superheronerd:	_sighs_
SuperGummying:	Personal finance isn't that important
Master9000:	energy that is released to slow down or block other things similar to how force fields in EP 1 work
superheronerd:	Why would you zone out in such an important class
Master9000:	the whole thing caome from an idea of suppresive energy
SuperGummying:	I like zoned out for an hour
SuperGummying:	Ahhh personal finance is so boring
superheronerd:	Sounds pretty awesome
superheronerd:	This is stuff I love hearing about
Master9000:	It's a stretch of but this server is largely based on time messing up severely
Master9000:	With anti mass comes anti energy and if that exists then time travel can happen
Master9000:	But antimatter, if it exists created a potential for anti mass if we ever discover what photons are
Master9000:	Gonna check with <@212257792722075650> first to see if there's any legitimacy to it
superheronerd:	Do tell
Master9000:	A huge stretch off of the existence of antimatter
Master9000:	I just came up with a crazy physics idea
superheronerd:	Thanks 😁
regal swan:	gj on tests
regal swan:	lol
superheronerd:	Also this squirrel wanted to take stuff out of this girls purse but it was closed
superheronerd:	Guys my test and essay were super easy 😌

Dragonite:	what about the number of times i've flushed him down the toilet
superheronerd:	No
SuperGummying:	*kicks bella*
superheronerd:	I looked at how many times you kick people in this server and there's already so much <@199725993416589313>
Master9000:	*opens fire on the circle of french survivors*
SuperGummying:	*kicks master*
Dragonite:	my nails are currently a steely gray because that's what iron looks like
Deino Mite:	its my favorite color
Deino Mite:	blue is the best
Master9000:	no gummy france is white
SuperGummying:	Get it right
superheronerd:	My nails are currently blue
SuperGummying:	France people
Kugallyblitz:	this is fact
superheronerd:	Blue is best color
Dragonite:	dragonite dreams of staying orange forever because dragonite is actually orange
Kugallyblitz:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kugallyblitz:	kugal dreams of having a blue name
Master9000:	in other words ```
-(gummy answer)=answer```
Dragonite:	which is to say, if gummy had answered "your name," the correct answer would have indeed been "toilet"
SuperGummying:	So who won the hundred year war?
Dragonite:	i mean, the answer is "your name," but the other answer is always "toilet," except gummy was the one who said it and he's always wrong, so the answer is "your name"
SuperGummying:	Here I have a question
Kugallyblitz:	just think if a = b and b = c then a = c
Master9000:	its a question of logic
Neon Strike Kitty:	I answered seriously and then thought it was a trick question so I gave a trick answer
Master9000:	transitive property doesnt apply to non-numbers
SuperGummying:	Window
Dragonite:	(－‸ლ)
Kugallyblitz:	Ida is correct
Neon Strike Kitty:	Pineapple
SuperGummying:	Toilet
Dragonite:	What's yours, but other people use more than you?
Dragonite:	i have a better one
Neon Strike Kitty:	No
Dragonite:	too long didnt read
Kireina:	ALL THAT FOR THIS???
SuperGummying:	Yes
Kireina:	what are you typing
Kugallyblitz:	"All rocks are chains and some chains are cans. Are all rocks cans? (Yes or no)"
Kireina:	Honestly like jesus christ
SuperGummying:	Blitz you're making me excited
Master9000:	severely
Dragonite:	outvoted again, gummy
superheronerd:	Ugh
Kireina:	Basically
Master9000:	yeah
Dragonite:	pretty much
SuperGummying:	No
superheronerd:	Is that how he's so high in the leaderboard?!
Master9000:	gummy chill
SuperGummying:	I'll ban you
Dragonite:	ban him
SuperGummying:	Nooooo
Master9000:	nevermind hes spamming
superheronerd:	Staaaaaaahp
SuperGummying:	Stalin
Master9000:	yeah hes guessing
Dragonite:	(╯°Д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
SuperGummying:	Napoleon
Master9000:	or hes just guessing idk
Dragonite:	(－‸ლ)
Dragonite:	> cute
Master9000:	hes trying to cite the one book he was forced to read lmao
SuperGummying:	70
Kireina:	whats happening lol
SuperGummying:	Keep going
Kireina:	?
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ
SuperGummying:	42
SuperGummying:	Hurry up
Kugallyblitz:	ok here it goes
Kugallyblitz:	first to answer and answer correctly will be crowned "more logical" <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
superheronerd:	I wish I could be one of those super cool and smart chemists or something
SuperGummying:	Okay blitz
Master9000:	lmao
Dragonite:	let alone against a real person
Kugallyblitz:	for master and gummy
Dragonite:	gummy, you couldn't logic yourself out of a paper bag
Kugallyblitz:	guys here's a quick logic test
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd say those have a lot of real world application
Master9000:	in boolean
Neon Strike Kitty:	I took nutrition classes
Master9000:	then tell me what 1+1=
SuperGummying:	Tbh I think I can have better logic than you
Master9000:	ok gummy
Master9000:	yeah super tasks are pretty cool but again it doesnt have all that much real world application
SuperGummying:	Master my logic is amazing
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's all I can remember
Neon Strike Kitty:	ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=y
Kugallyblitz:	when it comes to teaching, and learning, I'd like to be taught something I can actually use on a day to day, or month basis, however, I wouldn't mind learning so cool out of this world theoretical subject, like a super task for instance, because ya know, it cant be TOO boring now can it
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ
Master9000:	thats basic logic there buddy
Master9000:	yeah no shit
SuperGummying:	That's what he told me
SuperGummying:	It looks shady
SuperGummying:	Don't spend money on this website
superheronerd:	When math gets out of real world use it's all over for me
Master9000:	you already answered
SuperGummying:	I do
Master9000:	nevermind
Master9000:	do u remember what
SuperGummying:	What did you tell me again?
Master9000:	thats not a high standard to beat
Kugallyblitz:	lol gummy
Master9000:	and thus hate advanced trig which loses real world roots to be useful to
SuperGummying:	I listen to blitz the other day
SuperGummying:	Ida I do listen
Neon Strike Kitty:	you never listen
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lies, Gummy
Kugallyblitz:	hell only 23% roughly of the USA is PROFICIENT at math
SuperGummying:	Guys I listen in personal finance
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's more about people not being willing to put in the effort
Master9000:	i only do math for the tech application of it
Kugallyblitz:	I wouldn't expect everyone to be great at math, bella
Master9000:	its fine
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sewing is useful
superheronerd:	Also I'm horrid at math don't hate me guys 😌
Dragonite:	^
Master9000:	we already know youre doomed gummy
superheronerd:	Yes
SuperGummying:	Would you guys get angry if I told you I pretend to listen in personal finance?
Master9000:	3 century old economics
Kugallyblitz:	you'd be great at basic logic in an argumentative essay, for example
superheronerd:	Heck if i know
Kugallyblitz:	proficient too
Kugallyblitz:	or at least decent
Dragonite:	good job school
Dragonite:	how is sewing "economics"
Kugallyblitz:	if you;re good at math
Kugallyblitz:	im glad someone said it
superheronerd:	I took home ec. Easy A. But I learned sewing but that's cool
Kugallyblitz:	THANK YOU
Neon Strike Kitty:	Those are the people who didn't pay attention in math.
Neon Strike Kitty:	You know how people fail at basic logic?
superheronerd:	Even then it doesn't teach everything
Dragonite:	some schools have a home economics class but it's always an elective
superheronerd:	Unless you take the classes yourself
superheronerd:	Here they don't teach you a thing about bills, taxes, banking, _being a good adult_
Kugallyblitz:	and things of that sort
Master9000:	since im stuffed with tech stuff this year
Kugallyblitz:	just saying not everyone is gonna be a mathematician
SuperGummying:	Wait Bella they are teaching me personal finance
Master9000:	tahts gonna be one of my senior year courses
Kugallyblitz:	yeah, but it'd be easier if they taught more real world stuff than ya know, physics, unless that certain individual becomes a theoretical physicist when they go out into the real world
Dragonite:	what did you just not say
SuperGummying:	I did not just say that
SuperGummying:	No one saw that
SuperGummying:	Whoops didn't mean to say that
SuperGummying:	Pretty sure*
superheronerd:	As a requirement..
Neon Strike Kitty:	Might not be smart but at least you're pretty
superheronerd:	If only they taught taxes and finances..
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes, you're pretty
SuperGummying:	And that as well ^
Neon Strike Kitty:	but you learn things that help you contribute to society
SuperGummying:	I'm pretty sure ida just wants me to study
Neon Strike Kitty:	The subjects themselves might not be helpful
Kugallyblitz:	stuff like that
Dragonite:	i definitely did not learn my proper social skills in school lol
Kugallyblitz:	a car
Kugallyblitz:	a job
Kugallyblitz:	I mean the stuff that helps you get a house
Kugallyblitz:	when I mean not important stuff
Kugallyblitz:	well
Kugallyblitz:	that is true
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's not a very good way of thinking, blitz
Master9000:	and some coding/math
Kugallyblitz:	good for you
Kugallyblitz:	so if you can just pass
Kugallyblitz:	lets be honest, school doesn't really teach you anything important except for probably social skills and reading skills
Master9000:	also tell them you owe me 125 and to send it over promptly
Aqua033:	If my best was a D, she'd be fine with that
Master9000:	they gave in too easily
SuperGummying:	My parents know at this point idc so all they want me to do is pass
Kugallyblitz:	aww really
Aqua033:	My mom doesn't allow anything but the best from me.
Master9000:	85 is mastery or something like that here
Kugallyblitz:	anything over 79.99% is passing, and mastered
Kugallyblitz:	at my current school anything over 59.99% was passing, but not mastered
Master9000:	in almost all cases
SuperGummying:	Yeah....no wonder I never got an academic reward
superheronerd:	In most cases I would think
superheronerd:	Bare minimum is really not the thing to do
Master9000:	My parents wont allow anything bellow a 90
Dragonite:	you go to school
SuperGummying:	Dragonite go to school
SuperGummying:	That's what I do
SuperGummying:	Yeah all you do is pass by the bare minimum
Dragonite:	( :
Dragonite:	when i was in elementary school 70 was passing and 69 was failing
superheronerd:	Slightly jealous of this grading system
Dragonite:	well thjat's no fun
Kugallyblitz:	very generous grading system
SuperGummying:	50% is a pass
SuperGummying:	I passed
superheronerd:	Ap always has a homework thing
Master9000:	bellow passing
SuperGummying:	Master what was my mark?
Master9000:	and so do they probably
SuperGummying:	Math let's see
Kugallyblitz:	you get a 0
superheronerd:	Give me your smartness pls
Kugallyblitz:	guess what
Kugallyblitz:	but when you copy the answers of someone you constantly bother
Kugallyblitz:	you get a 0
Kugallyblitz:	cos if you're caught
Kugallyblitz:	I gave him a lesson why you should change answers
Kugallyblitz:	well
Dragonite:	i never bothered with anything weird like changing answers though, i was just like "no"
Dragonite:	people were constantly asking for my homework in math in senior year
Kugallyblitz:	wow lol
Master9000:	im pretty sure 95% of people are involved in some form of homework exchange in my ap world class
Kugallyblitz:	he never bothered me again
Kugallyblitz:	"Smarter than the average bear motherfucker"
Kugallyblitz:	to which I said
Kugallyblitz:	he looked at me
Dragonite:	(◕ ε ◕)
Kugallyblitz:	I got a near perfect 29/30
Kugallyblitz:	and he got a 0
Kugallyblitz:	except I changed the answers
Kugallyblitz:	so I was like sure you can copy my homework
Kugallyblitz:	copying math hw at that school was taken ery seriously
Kugallyblitz:	now
Kugallyblitz:	and so he asks if he can copy my math homework
Deino Mite:	im pretty good at all subjects in school
Kugallyblitz:	and then he keeps bothering me "yogi yogi"
Kugallyblitz:	and this kid called me yogi
Kugallyblitz:	at lunch, I would eat a lot of junk food
Kugallyblitz:	in 6th grade
Kugallyblitz:	i got a really funny story about math
Master9000:	tbh theres no subject that doesnt make at least some sence for me
Dragonite:	that happened with me and history when i was 14
Dragonite:	i see where this is going
Neon Strike Kitty:	And I ended up having some decent advice.
Master9000:	the remaining half probably just arent interested in or cant afford to care about it
Kugallyblitz:	oh boy
Kugallyblitz:	uh huh
Neon Strike Kitty:	One day, one of my classmates asked me for help with it.
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, back in my third year, I was taking chemistry. It was my worst subject.
Kugallyblitz:	oooh story time
Master9000:	its because they have no interest in it and fall behind for half of them
Neon Strike Kitty:	Here's a weird story
superheronerd:	Pls rescue me
superheronerd:	I'm taking algebra in this summer
Kugallyblitz:	I dont get why it's so hard for the other 76% of the USA but it is
Master9000:	Same
Neon Strike Kitty:	^blitz
Dragonite:	trigonometry master race
Kugallyblitz:	I dont know why but math in general just makes perfect sense to me
Neon Strike Kitty:	I greatly enjoy algebra
superheronerd:	Everyone loves marth
Neon Strike Kitty:	(Math is fun)
superheronerd:	It is not in my skill set
Neon Strike Kitty:	Do you love him?
Neon Strike Kitty:	What about Marth?
superheronerd:	How do you do it
Kugallyblitz:	I absolutely love math
superheronerd:	You win 😵
superheronerd:	Oh god do you guys actually like math then?
superheronerd:	Blitz, same. Aside from the volunteering. Good on you though
Dragonite:	i went to math summer camp in 7th grade
Kugallyblitz:	gues I AM
Kugallyblitz:	I mean I volunteered to take summer school math so I can get more college credits so...
Master9000:	x>x ?
Dragonite:	i'm a bigger nerd than me
superheronerd:	That is the question.
superheronerd:	Who is the biggest nerd?
Dragonite:	i'm a bigger nerd
superheronerd:	Hey nerds
Master9000:	and got hte +50
Master9000:	PENTAKILL
Master9000:	PENTAKILL PAPAJOHN
willofd2011:	Nice ^w^

Master9000:	could be
regal swan:	sugar cookie?
willofd2011:	*gives everyone a cookie cause why not* lol
SuperGummying:	No you aren't look away
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm in that chat
SuperGummying:	Yup they are happy
Deino Mite:	gummy's forcing us to say yes!
SuperGummying:	Let me check
SuperGummying:	Hold on
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because you tell them to?
SuperGummying:	My people will be happy
SuperGummying:	The Grand Duchy of Gumsaw
SuperGummying:	Whoops meant Duchy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, you've got all these *coughs* amazing military strategies, but what about your people?
Dragonite:	duchy
SuperGummying:	And the Grand Duchy of Gumsaw
Master9000:	<@137336478291329024> should i mute gummy <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Like the Confederation of the Gum
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	With buffer states
SuperGummying:	Well you can have the Gumlin Empire
Dragonite:	\/ban \<@199725993416589313>
SuperGummying:	And btw screw the Soviet Union
Master9000:	prove it
SuperGummying:	My military strategy is amazing
Master9000:	and why everyone cheered when stalin died and the truth was revealed
Deino Mite:	also not that great
Dragonite:	like, there's a reason the USSR and the rest of the world were not friends
Deino Mite:	erasing people from history
Neon Strike Kitty:	^
Master9000:	also not something you want to do
Master9000:	killing 50% of your people because you suck at actual military strategy
Dragonite:	not something you want to emulate
Dragonite:	massive human rights violations
Dragonite:	gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Give me lithium
Master9000:	no you dont
SuperGummying:	I love the Soviet Union though
Dragonite:	hydrogen, helium, lithium and beryllium
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm fire
Master9000:	also gummy news flash communist russia fell like 30 years ago
SuperGummying:	What four elements?
Deino Mite:	gummy is a communist sympathizer!
Dragonite:	the soviet union is not something you want to emulate
Deino Mite:	why are they cities in communist russia?
Master9000:	out of the four elements we have here which one would u probably want?
SuperGummying:	Gumscow, Saint Gumlinberg, and Gumlingrad are the cities
SuperGummying:	Of The Gumlin Empire
Dragonite:	｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
Dragonite:	of exactly nothing
Master9000:	of
SuperGummying:	I'm an emperor
Kireina:	Therefore Taunt is ***SUPER EFFECTIVE***
Kireina:	gummy is an enigma
Kireina:	He doesn't follow the rules of common sense
SuperGummying:	...
Kireina:	Not w/ gummy it isn't
Dragonite:	taunt is a status move though
Master9000:	***SUPER EFFECTIVE***
Dragonite:	_taunts Gummy_
Master9000:	that means theres more between each one as you get higher
Master9000:	level ups are exponential gummy
Master9000:	ok well
Kireina:	^
Dragonite:	you monster
SuperGummying:	It was cool
Kireina:	......
SuperGummying:	I never seen anyone fainting before
Kireina:	Gummy care to explain why this is 'rad' ?
Kireina:	...?
Aqua033:	He had 10,000 when the ser- what
SuperGummying:	It was rad
SuperGummying:	Someone fainted in my school today
Kireina:	Tell me when you do cause uh clearly you ain't until you do
SuperGummying:	Btw
SuperGummying:	Watch me
Kireina:	Maybe, maybe not
SuperGummying:	To be fair I'm still going to beat him
Kireina:	so he wouldn't have had that big of an advantage
Kireina:	Nah, most of the bots were setup around the time we were able to access the server
Aqua033:	Yeag
Aqua033:	To be fair, he was the one who set everything up and made sure everything was running
Kireina:	Nah, I'm pretty sure he got most of his points when he is messing around with the bots
SuperGummying:	What a cheater
Kireina:	Then I stopped caring
Kireina:	The closest I closed the gap to was like 5,000 points
Deino Mite:	master gave himself extra levels at the beginning of the server
Kireina:	That'll literally be impossible (it would take a while at the very least)
SuperGummying:	Because I wanna be #1
Master9000:	why
SuperGummying:	I gotta beat master
Kireina:	I'm gonna be the wot
superheronerd:	What else could we possible talk about?
Dragonite:	why are we discussing my use of /me
superheronerd:	I can see that now lmao
superheronerd:	Wow
Master9000:	ctrl f all his /me's lmao
superheronerd:	_was not aware of this _
Master9000:	it didnt work for dragonite before a LOT
superheronerd:	It didn't work for you before?
Master9000:	i got /me to work
Master9000:	weird
Master9000:	_oof_
superheronerd:	It is now raining ?
superheronerd:	Space
Master9000:	yeah
superheronerd:	State-wise?
Master9000:	where are u?
superheronerd:	It's cold outside, and it's may. Make it stop. 😟
superheronerd:	Pretty awesome
Master9000:	a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
Neon Strike Kitty:	so that's nice
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well he's participating
superheronerd:	It didn't register to me there are more blues now
Master9000:	im a bit surprised eyan is 6th
superheronerd:	I honestly was just looking at that
willofd2011:	Hmm?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just realized that my name now matches my icon's hair color
Master9000:	will you must be proud
superheronerd:	It's impressive
Master9000:	its all of her exp at most and 65.277777...% exp at least
Neon Strike Kitty:	156
Neon Strike Kitty:	or capital
superheronerd:	Or the little ^w^
Neon Strike Kitty:	60 with xd
Master9000:	that was fast
superheronerd:	It's gonna be really all of them
Neon Strike Kitty:	564 results with lol in them
Master9000:	most likely
Master9000:	also i need to check what percent of will's exp came from messages with some sort of laugh expression in them
Neon Strike Kitty:	Panda's gonna be the first non-Triforce blue
Master9000:	the leaderboard isnt exactly what i expected but im also nto surprised
Neon Strike Kitty:	Jello's like 1 point above Blitz
superheronerd:	But I'm for it
superheronerd:	Blitz is here so often that it will be a short victory
SuperGummying:	Mine sounds better
SuperGummying:	Gumlinspam
Neon Strike Kitty:	Just gotta pass kugal
SuperGummying:	Dragonitespam
superheronerd:	Spam is not the way
SuperGummying:	Spam
superheronerd:	Also I really just want to see if I can ever break the top ten for a second here
Master9000:	what a 3rd person talker
SuperGummying:	What a spammer
Master9000:	blue team triple
SuperGummying:	Welp
Master9000:	oof
Neon Strike Kitty:	This
Master9000:	why would i do that
SuperGummying:	What
SuperGummying:	Master get to Gumlingrad
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, guess what
Master9000:	what did u expect
superheronerd:	Even if I'm bored and can't play injustice
SuperGummying:	Nooo
superheronerd:	So imma stay in this cozy library
SuperGummying:	But Gumlingrad needs you
superheronerd:	It's cold outside.
superheronerd:	Plus I mean
SuperGummying:	😭
Master9000:	oof
superheronerd:	I don't need to do anything 😇
Neon Strike Kitty:	*you're
Master9000:	no she doesnt
SuperGummying:	Bella your second in command you need to be at Gumlingrad
Master9000:	and thats the story of how gummy ran away from a 9 year old with a glock and burned allong with his city
SuperGummying:	No there aren't
superheronerd:	_turns around and goes back to doing anything else_
Neon Strike Kitty:	and don't actually work
Neon Strike Kitty:	Your tactics are always the same
SuperGummying:	No retreating at Gumlingrad
Master9000:	sounds stupid
SuperGummying:	Than we fight
SuperGummying:	We run and burn until we reach Gumlingrad
Master9000:	or one you should be proud of
Master9000:	not a good one
SuperGummying:	Hence the scorched invite policy
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals the paranoia*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals self*
SuperGummying:	I'm always paranoid
Master9000:	thats some next level paranoia
SuperGummying:	You are the suspect though
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals the suspects*
SuperGummying:	You two are the most likely suspects if something happens to my stuff tbh
SuperGummying:	You two don't touch my money
Neon Strike Kitty:	ISK
Master9000:	not even ukraine is doing that badly and theyre in a war against russia
SuperGummying:	$9.20 usd
SuperGummying:	Nope
SuperGummying:	That's like $9.31 usd
Master9000:	thats a terrible conversion rate
SuperGummying:	Noooo my $12.55 Canadian
Master9000:	have fun looking at the $0.01
SuperGummying:	Have fun getting me a psychologist
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals it*
SuperGummying:	Imma go back staring at YouTube money
SuperGummying:	Darn
Neon Strike Kitty:	You missed
Neon Strike Kitty:	*is on a different continent*
Master9000:	*blocks hit* sir
SuperGummying:	*smacks ida*
SuperGummying:	Screw you ida

SuperGummying:	That doesn't make sense
SuperGummying:	....
Master9000:	get rekt
Master9000:	1 3 5 7 9
SuperGummying:	You can't even prove that
SuperGummying:	There are no odds
Master9000:	because according to you, the odds are better for you listening to a girl than a guy
SuperGummying:	That's the first question
SuperGummying:	Why female?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals Gummy's youtube dollar*
Master9000:	we need to get u a female psychologist buddy
SuperGummying:	I look at it everyday
Master9000:	cant touch what doesnt exist
SuperGummying:	My YouTube money is priceless
SuperGummying:	Hey do not touch gummy money
Neon Strike Kitty:	Swan, you up?
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK I wanna play YGO
Master9000:	he said my payment should be here by the end of the month
Neon Strike Kitty:	Def
Master9000:	yep
SuperGummying:	Now did Dragonite pretend to be me?
SuperGummying:	Gummy back
Neon Strike Kitty:	My cat is 17 years old, nearsighted and partially deaf
willofd2011:	I don't have cats either
Inferno:	I have cats, can confirm, it demands everything
willofd2011:	Lol

superheronerd:	It demands everything.
Neon Strike Kitty:	My cat is demanding something and I don't know what
regal swan:	torture i will never go through again thats school
willofd2011:	Sounds like it lol
superheronerd:	😌
superheronerd:	A thing that takes sleep time away
willofd2011:	What's this thing called school <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
superheronerd:	Right. Time zones. Just curious 😁
Master9000:	Got out of school an hour ago
superheronerd:	I guess I've never asked, but do you have classes or anything?
Master9000:	I'm ~~cutting~~ shaping a bush
superheronerd:	I have an hour to do nothing~
superheronerd:	Oh well.
superheronerd:	My summer course starts three days after my current four end. 🙃
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah, I remember when I went to school <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
superheronerd:	The exams typically are derived straight from it, so I think I'm pretty solid
superheronerd:	Not bad
superheronerd:	The Quizlet my prof gave us had 97 things on it. Only took less than 40 minutes
superheronerd:	The test itself is basically bach and Mozart.
Master9000:	He was only 1800s tho <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Master9000:	Whenever I hear post renaissance music I automatically think of Beethoven unless they say after Modern period because then it goes to 20s jazz and so on
superheronerd:	It's not as much as it sounds, really.
superheronerd:	I gotta write an in class essay on Mozart too
superheronerd:	Enlightenment and baroque time period music and musicians of the time
Master9000:	Better than being surprised by just how much you don't know
superheronerd:	I knew more of it than I thought _shrugs_
Master9000:	What's the test on?
superheronerd:	Ok I finished studying for my test
Master9000:	I like scolding my dad about tech stuff tbh
Master9000:	Just cleaned up the studio comp and installed the correct driver for the printer instead of the bs fake one they tried to get from an unofficial website
Neon Strike Kitty:	So what's up?
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's kind of night here lol
Master9000:	Good afternoon lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	Morning
regal swan:	cya
Master9000:	Cya bella
superheronerd:	Later nerds
superheronerd:	That reminds me  to go study
SuperGummying:	Argue with master
SuperGummying:	Dragonite act like me for the hour
superheronerd:	Uh huh
SuperGummying:	😇
SuperGummying:	Not texting in class btw
SuperGummying:	Summer classes don't sound fun
superheronerd:	Summer classes make my plans to work more so much more inconvenient
SuperGummying:	I'll argue that later
SuperGummying:	Never brb class
Master9000:	Yeah you are
SuperGummying:	Master I'm not paying you
Master9000:	Even with unreal high compounding interest that's gonna take a long ass time to make a serious dent in the price
SuperGummying:	I hope that helped
SuperGummying:	*Gives Bella 5 cents*
SuperGummying:	Hmm
superheronerd:	Haha.
superheronerd:	I don't
superheronerd:	The total I need for the things I want is at $375.
SuperGummying:	Yeah
superheronerd:	You think I have $50?
superheronerd:	Think I'm totally getting deluxe edition because of the supergirl skin to powergirl. How fun
Master9000:	Why?
SuperGummying:	I need $50 worth of the grand Big Mac
SuperGummying:	*looks at Bella*
SuperGummying:	Fine I'll get Bella to get for me
Master9000:	Good thing you just said I get another $50 out of you yesterday
SuperGummying:	It's only $50
SuperGummying:	$$
Master9000:	With what
SuperGummying:	So you can get it for me
SuperGummying:	You live in the states
SuperGummying:	No I don't need a credit card
superheronerd:	There is a version of injustice 2 that costs 100 dollars
Master9000:	So many geese...
Master9000:	You think I have a credit card?
SuperGummying:	Because I want this thing but I don't have a credit card at the moment
Master9000:	Why do u need to borrow money
Master9000:	You already owe me
SuperGummying:	Master can I seriously borrow money
Master9000:	Gummy your payments to me are all in USD
superheronerd:	Jeez that's steep
SuperGummying:	Usd
SuperGummying:	I need $50
SuperGummying:	For me apparently $50 usd is $68.23 Canadian
SuperGummying:	Hopefully
superheronerd:	Hopefully in August. I have a free-ish month
SuperGummying:	Well Bella you will get it one day
superheronerd:	Especially with injustice being out tomorrow ):
Master9000:	That's probably you just destroying your graphics card
superheronerd:	Honestly if things didn't keep happening that require me to use money, I could easily get my PS4 by now ):
SuperGummying:	Remember kids don't do dumb things with your credit card
SuperGummying:	I need a new credit card
superheronerd:	20 dollars is only slightly convincing for my efforts to get a PS4
SuperGummying:	400 fps to 100-200 fps
SuperGummying:	Well my gaming pc is starting to get slow
Master9000:	Obviously a board that supports crossfire
Master9000:	May I recommend the ryzen 7 with 6 gtx 1080ti
superheronerd:	Aqua i am envious. Sounds awesome
willofd2011:	Ikr lol ^w^
Master9000:	Sounds good aqua
SuperGummying:	I'll give you $20
SuperGummying:	Pls join
Aqua033:	My mom: I want to get you a gaming computer, but if I do, you'll have to come out of your room every so often.
Me: So, you're telling me that I can have a free and good computer, and the tradeoff is that I have to get outside of my room every so often.
What exactly is the downside here?
willofd2011:	How are you guys doing ^w^
Master9000:	The damage is already done
Master9000:	Gummy that's like shooting someone then trying to take the bullet out
superheronerd:	No
superheronerd:	Hey will (:
Master9000:	Hi will
SuperGummying:	*rubs it* there all better now will you be on my side?
willofd2011:	Hai friends ^w^
SuperGummying:	It's just a scratch
SuperGummying:	*looks at Bella's arm*
Master9000:	Repeatedly
superheronerd:	Yeah, that too.
Master9000:	Not after you attacked her
superheronerd:	~
superheronerd:	I am on my side.
SuperGummying:	You are on gummy side
SuperGummying:	No Bella
superheronerd:	That works too
Dragonite:	_throws Dragonite at Gummy_
superheronerd:	But I'm neutral
superheronerd:	Sounds funny
SuperGummying:	Okay how about you lift me and throw me into Dragonite
superheronerd:	There is flaw in these actions, it seems.
SuperGummying:	Okay you are heavy
SuperGummying:	*tries again*
SuperGummying:	Okay um
superheronerd:	_literally doesn't budge_
SuperGummying:	Is it working?
SuperGummying:	*tries to lift bella*
superheronerd:	But oh well
superheronerd:	Precisely
SuperGummying:	I question if I can even lift you tbh...
superheronerd:	Riiiiight
SuperGummying:	*throws Bella at Dragonite*
SuperGummying:	Um
SuperGummying:	Oh
superheronerd:	But it broke
SuperGummying:	*smacks Bella on the head*
SuperGummying:	*pulls Dragonite down the toilet*
superheronerd:	Oh well
Dragonite:	Good point
Dragonite:	_looks at the fragments of toilet scattered all over the floor_
superheronerd:	Steel toed shoes must hurt so bad if you get hit by one
Dragonite:	stop being so violent
Dragonite:	_puts on a steel-plated boot and stamps down on the toilet_
superheronerd:	Thanks
SuperGummying:	*kicks Bella really hard*
superheronerd:	So no being mean ~
superheronerd:	I can actually kick you harder, thank you very much 😌
SuperGummying:	*kicks bella*
SuperGummying:	*hits Dragonite*
superheronerd:	He could dress like Mario
Dragonite:	he might as well become a plumber, at this rate
superheronerd:	How lovely.
Dragonite:	_skewers Gummy on a stick and flushes him down the toilet_
superheronerd:	Could've been worse i guess
SuperGummying:	I felt like it
SuperGummying:	Idk
Master9000:	Why
Master9000:	But
SuperGummying:	It was like a tap
superheronerd:	For no abuse?
SuperGummying:	It wasn't a hard poke
superheronerd:	Thanks?
SuperGummying:	That's why I'm just poking you
SuperGummying:	You didn't do anything
superheronerd:	What did I do ):
Master9000:	*takes away the stick*
SuperGummying:	*pokes Bella with a stick*
superheronerd:	Oh jeez
SuperGummying:	*beats Dragonite with a stick*
Master9000:	So does dragonite
SuperGummying:	And he Defenestrates me
SuperGummying:	Because he's um mean
superheronerd:	🤔
superheronerd:	But why
SuperGummying:	*beats master with a stick*
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **superheronerd leveled up!**
superheronerd:	This chat has demonstrated the lack of sleep you guys all have.
Master9000:	*Defenestrates gummy again*
SuperGummying:	Hey that's mean
Dragonite:	_chucks Gummy out the window_
SuperGummying:	*slaps Dragonite*
Dragonite:	_slaps people_

Aqua033:	Now that I know I can be an asshole with this, I'm going to be
Aqua033:	I couldn't be assed to change it back, so I kept it
Aqua033:	It was because this girl kept calling me Awua, because it's cute, and I changed it
Aqua033:	Ngl I didn't even do the name change thing to annoy people at first
Kireina:	icic
Aqua033:	I'm not nearly as bad with my occasional changing of the Q to a W
Aqua033:	There's this one person, who goes by Spell
Except sometimes, he changes it to Speii, but the I is capitalized. So by the time people remember how to ping him, he's back to Spell.
Kireina:	lol
Aqua033:	How to annoy the hell out of people who ping you:
Step 1: Change your name and keep it for 6 months.
Step 2: When people finally remember how to ping you, change it back.

Deino Mite:	so then its 1-1 for g2 vs tsm
SuperGummying:	Yes
Deino Mite:	did tsm beat g2 in the first matchup?
Deino Mite:	so theres gonna be a three way tie 4-6
Deino Mite:	either fw or gam will be 4-6

willofd2011:	Lol
BreeZaps:	Chugga's fans are crazy people.
MajesticEclipse02:	And that is ?
SuperGummying:	Just do what I do majestic

superheronerd:	I want 50 dollars
MajesticEclipse02:	I tried my best
Master9000:	thats up to $75 now right?
SuperGummying:	You didn't help me yesterday
Master9000:	i saved that just in case
SuperGummying:	No majestic

SuperGummying:	For no reason
SuperGummying:	Master I'll pay you $50
SuperGummying:	Yeah let's make a conversation
Master9000:	*continues to create conversation to distract eyan*
superheronerd:	See ya eyan
Master9000:	cya
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I'm gonna stop talking and try to get the work done that I need to get done.  I'll see ya guys later for stream.
superheronerd:	DCTV get their own panel and i really really want to go see it
SuperGummying:	They showed the killing joke movie in comic con last year
KingofZeal:	I don't see myself going to twitch con any time soon unless my stream took off
superheronerd:	The worst part is that comic con is in San Diego and that's not even terribly terribly far from me
willofd2011:	Do you think you'll ever go to twitch con eyan?
Dragonite:	and also there is nothing biased about magfest being a blast
KingofZeal:	Granted, my experiences were mildly biased
Dragonite:	brb apparently grandma's playing Ping Pong
KingofZeal:	I never thought I'd care for conventions, but after being to many, they're a hell of a blast
Dragonite:	it was a glorious mess
Dragonite:	i was at Comic Con once
Master9000:	conventions have never been of personal interest
SuperGummying:	Lol we said that at the same time
KingofZeal:	I wish I could recommend Magfest, but yeah, I just can't do it, it's not in me anymore
SuperGummying:	I wanna go to comic con
superheronerd:	I'd much rather go to comic con tho
MajesticEclipse02:	I want to go to blizzcon at some point in my life
Dragonite:	and i'm not a claustrophobic person
Dragonite:	i honestly couldnt do Pax, the stories of the crowds alone make me claustrophobic
KingofZeal:	If you specifically wanted to see me, best I could suggest is Tekko in Pittsburgh.  I plan on going next year no matter what
superheronerd:	I'd love to go to any PAX
willofd2011:	It's gonna cost quite a bit for the flight to the east coast alone but I can try and save up lol
Master9000:	*links the lenny DNA*
SuperGummying:	Go to PAX
Dragonite:	_skewers Gummy with Pax_
SuperGummying:	PAX
Master9000:	how can u turn down taht face <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Dragonite:	(っ◕‿◕)っ
KingofZeal:	It wouldn't be good for me
KingofZeal:	I honestly think I'm just too mentally broken for Magfest
Master9000:	*is unable to relate*
Dragonite:	_dies of convention withdrawal in general_
Dragonite:	i need to do that
KingofZeal:	I just don't see myself making Magfest
KingofZeal:	You could try to find your way to tekkoshocon in Pittsburgh next year.  I can pretty much guarentee I'll go to that
Dragonite:	yall need to do that
superheronerd:	I've never been to a convention
Divexz:	and a whole lot of ducats
MajesticEclipse02:	Same will
Divexz:	23 intrigue
willofd2011:	*has never been to Magfest*
Master9000:	how do i sacrifice my sister?
Dragonite:	xnx
Dragonite:	_dies of Magfest withdrawal_
Dragonite:	dammit
Kireina:	The latter sounds more fun
Kireina:	Or Sacraficing someone
MajesticEclipse02:	Ball*
MajesticEclipse02:	A crystal vall
Dragonite:	~~eyan i'll give you my soul if you go back to Magfest~~
Master9000:	whats the catalyst for using souls?
KingofZeal:	Yeah, that might help
Kireina:	I better see you hit that DnD button Eyan
MajesticEclipse02:	Do you want to borrow my soul for more power ?
KingofZeal:	Don't be shocked if tonight's stream looks like garbage
Master9000:	<:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
KingofZeal:	Ye
KingofZeal:	On top of everything else I need to accomplish
Master9000:	for mario tennis?
KingofZeal:	I have 3 and a half hours to make an overlay for tonight's stream
Master9000:	youre welcome
SuperGummying:	Lol
KingofZeal:	You guys are distracting me
KingofZeal:	Anyways

KingofZeal:	^
Master9000:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_DqV1xdf-Y
Dragonite:	cooking makes them easier to digest
Deino Mite:	*insert unlimited power meme here*
SuperGummying:	Dragonite don't touch gummy
superheronerd:	What's this about souls?
Master9000:	how does it affect the origional owner of the soul?
MajesticEclipse02:	Heh
KingofZeal:	Or something like that
KingofZeal:	Why, I use souls for unlimited power of course
Master9000:	go for it dragonite
willofd2011:	Lol ok XD
Master9000:	what do u use souls for?
Dragonite:	can i have gummy's soul if i promise to barbecue it for you?

SuperGummying:	Ida I almost lost $1500
MajesticEclipse02:	*uses awesome powers to make the fighting stop*
Animal_Glue_:	lol
Master9000:	it was a after we had a conversation about sports which then involved tennis, then eyan brought up the game and now we are all awaiting the stream to see it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Great, now I can have dinner
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals Gummy's wallet*

SuperGummying:	Don't let ida hurt me pls
SuperGummying:	*hides behind master*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know but it's hilarious
SuperGummying:	.....
Animal_Glue_:	Wait since when do we love mario tennis?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*takes Gummy's shit and sells it back to him at five times the asking price*
MajesticEclipse02:	My bad I don't know English, but still!!! This is a serious problem
Master9000:	*doesnt take gummy's shit*
SuperGummying:	*patronizes ida*
Master9000:	i dont think we're going to your hole potato store
Neon Strike Kitty:	Actually pin it
Kireina:	the problems that made the problem go wrong
Dragonite:	just take pictures and call it "science"
Kireina:	we are addressing the problems
MajesticEclipse02:	Stop patronizing me!!!! This is a serious problem that must be addressed
Master9000:	the potato wanted bigger holes...
Kireina:	not enough holes? 🤔
Dragonite:	clearly the potato thought otherwise
Kireina:	🤔
MajesticEclipse02:	I did though!!!!
Kireina:	so you didn't poke any holes
Master9000:	same
Dragonite:	i knew it
MajesticEclipse02:	I open the microwave and my potato is basically gone
MajesticEclipse02:	Look I was microwaving a potato and out of nowhere I hear a loud bang
Dragonite:	also someone pin this: [3:20 PM] MajesticEclipse02: So my potato just freaking exploded
Dragonite:	did you stick it in the microwave without poking holes in it first
MajesticEclipse02:	Exploded
MajesticEclipse02:	Freaking
MajesticEclipse02:	And it
MajesticEclipse02:	I was making potatoes
MajesticEclipse02:	I'm serious
regal swan:	lol?
MajesticEclipse02:	So my potato just freaking exploded
Master9000:	do they just rush banshees on most mids?
Rainy:	As much as I like memeing against TSM, I really wanna see Bjerg pop off on ahri
KingofZeal:	And yes, they're playing, everyone plays 2 games a day
KingofZeal:	They're playing right now
Master9000:	no youre not <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Lightning:	Is TSM playing today?
Divexz:	not much missed
Divexz:	I'm watching PDXcon and writing an 8 page essay
Master9000:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Bob Ross is better
Dragonite:	(barf) League of Legends
KingofZeal:	Which I just did btw if anybody wants to watch MSI on my stream.  @here
Master9000:	had me confused there lol
Master9000:	oh ok
KingofZeal:	Whoever was streaming first keeps the autohost, I have to manually switch it
KingofZeal:	It's just the way autohost works
Master9000:	eyan do u want it to be hosting bob ross during lcs?
Master9000:	tfw you dunk on someone thru fountain and then oneshot the gp who tries to come out of fountain <:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Master9000:	well u got it right once before so it counts <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	TM
KingofZeal:	There's also the fact that I'm a strong independent man who does whatever the hell he wants
SuperGummying:	Great
SuperGummying:	....
Master9000:	eyan you have tm down but theres also `:LUL:`
KingofZeal:	Not after that first blood, lul
SuperGummying:	Confidence boost
SuperGummying:	I mean beating flash wolves would be nice as well
KingofZeal:	I think things have to get pretty weird to not make it out of groups
KingofZeal:	If that's the case, they pretty much only need to beat G2
SuperGummying:	That's the most important right now
SuperGummying:	I mean I think it's just best they get the first seed for NA
KingofZeal:	Cause nobody's beating SKT at this point
KingofZeal:	They probably do need to win both though, getting 4th basically means you have no shot of making finals and coming second
KingofZeal:	If they win both games, they're auto lock for groups
SuperGummying:	They may have a chance
SuperGummying:	If tsm can win the two games today
KingofZeal:	Very TSMy
KingofZeal:	I like TSM's draft for this upcoming game
Master9000:	a song wont support a region to the death
KingofZeal:	I cheer for NA as much as the next guy, but that highlight music, so hype
Master9000:	KR tho
SuperGummying:	But na 😭
KingofZeal:	^
Master9000:	well youre gummy
SuperGummying:	Well I still think out of all the msi music that one I posted is the best
KingofZeal:	Uh, no, I wanted the highlight music they use
Master9000:	i like it
Master9000:	8 bitty
SuperGummying:	https://youtu.be/skTmDvbfu34
SuperGummying:	This is better Eyan
SuperGummying:	Lol
KingofZeal:	I HAVE DONE IT, finally found the MSI song that I've been hunting for for two weeks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHbaS0MiA3c
SuperGummying:	Kk
superheronerd:	I'll be back

Neon Strike Kitty:	8 am
Neon Strike Kitty:	I stayed up til 8 talking to you fools
superheronerd:	I mean I guess?
Master9000:	development counts as well
superheronerd:	At least for me.
superheronerd:	Not all of them.
Master9000:	those are online
superheronerd:	Or with games
Master9000:	so much to do on the internet
SuperGummying:	Yeah sleep is hard
superheronerd:	Even if I want to sleep, it's hard to have it happen
SuperGummying:	Gummy doesn't sleep
superheronerd:	No
Master9000:	dejavu
Neon Strike Kitty:	Do you people just not sleep?
Master9000:	<:KappaPride:305603580017246209>

SuperGummying:	i missed you
SuperGummying:	where were you all day yesterday
Dragonite:	now what
SuperGummying:	DRAGONITE
Dragonite:	i like how it lists "adobe premiere pro: 19.99" without mentioning that it's now a subscription service
Rainy:	#throwbacksunday
Dragonite:	did not know that still existed
Dragonite:	pinnacle studio
Master9000:	I remember not installing any editing software yet
Dragonite:	it was way overkill for whatever they needed to do though
Dragonite:	my school used it, for whatever reason
Dragonite:	i remember that thing
Dragonite:	final cut pro
Rainy:	But my desktop runs a gutted windows 10 because I'm too lazy to wine everything.
regal swan:	morn all
Master9000:	Look up a bit and read the OS discussion
Rainy:	All my laptops run mint, I am quite a fan
SuperGummying:	http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/multimedia/best-professional-video-editing-software/
SuperGummying:	Not according to this
Crow_Songs:	what am i doing
Master9000:	Do it
Crow_Songs:	WELCOME TO THE DOMAIN OF LINUX
Rainy:	HI
Crow_Songs:	HELLO
Rainy:	Because final cut is factually better
Master9000:	Looks better and I have <@212257792722075650> here (any day now) to argue about the apps
Master9000:	*cough* linux *cough*
SuperGummying:	Why use final cut when you can use premiere pro
Rainy:	But yeah, otherwise trash
Rainy:	And it looks pretty
Rainy:	So is garage band
Rainy:	Final cut is 👌
Master9000:	It's a pretty low standard to beat
Rainy:	OSX is still way better than iOS
Master9000:	Linux
SuperGummying:	Windows
Master9000:	Mac OS still sucks
SuperGummying:	And you complain about Apple
SuperGummying:	See master
Master9000:	*sends rainy a gamepigeon challenge*
Rainy:	Yeah, but not a lot, just a little bit
Master9000:	Right <@212257792722075650> ?
Master9000:	That has to count for something
Master9000:	I'm not using safari
Rainy:	You use iOS, your input is invalid
Master9000:	
Master9000:	Yeah it has emotional implications such as more irritable or tired. Just usually used in a different context ig
Rainy:	So is hungry an emotion?
Master9000:	It works
Master9000:	Feeling happy, glad, aroused, sad
Rainy:	Never thought of it that way.
Rainy:	Is that an emotion?
Master9000:	I thought that would be arousal...
Rainy:	It's the only emotion I have nowadays
Rainy:	Something about you being incredulous that I feel guilt.
Master9000:	That was intentional how much of it did u get thru
Rainy:	lol
Rainy:	But mostly I'd feel guilty
Rainy:	Tempting, but I'm sitting far enough away that she's pretty much unintelligible..
Master9000:	Send an audio clip lol
Rainy:	But I am at a ceremony sorta thing and this speaker is like listening to a mixture of cotton candy and coffee.
Rainy:	I like silent k's
Rainy:	Nah
Master9000:	Did you mean heathens?
Rainy:	Was that rude of me?
Rainy:	Entertain me, knaves
Pogi:	<@!128672344624463872> is it bad that I like Serj's single stuff better than when he was on SOAD?
Master9000:	yeah, go look at the clips of explosions that happened while we were playing and he was drunk in <#305488106050813954>

JelloHammer:	Have a listen to this:
SuperGummying:	I have no clue who that is
JelloHammer:	Because Amy Lee has one of the best voices in rock
JelloHammer:	Honestly though, the whole ordeal was idiotic
superheronerd:	I didn't know that actually
superheronerd:	Yeller*
Master9000:	*Cites thefatrat songs*
superheronerd:	Yes the teller. Good to know
JelloHammer:	he just appears for that one song
superheronerd:	The yeller?- oh
JelloHammer:	Is actually not part of the band
JelloHammer:	The guy who goes "WAKE ME UP"
JelloHammer:	Did you know that a male singer was crowbarred into Evanescence's Bring Me to Life against the band's wishes (by the record label) because they thought that a solo female singer for a metal band would not do well?
SuperGummying:	...
Master9000:	Yes
Rainy:	WAKE ME UP
Deci:	like, classical genre, or classical as in super old
JelloHammer:	fun fact time
Master9000:	How about hardcore dubstep remix 2017?
SuperGummying:	Classical music hmmm
JelloHammer:	a true classic
Master9000:	Ok
Deci:	that's not classical rainy
JelloHammer:	AH yes
Rainy:	Bring Me to Life
Master9000:	The sleeping man

KingofZeal:	She is
JelloHammer:	add that to the guro porn list
KingofZeal:	Actually
Rainy:	I am sorta
Master9000:	Wait but you're not schala
Rainy:	Shoot me in the face
Rainy:	Yes, kill me daddy
JelloHammer:	lul
Master9000:	She's annoying
KingofZeal:	BYE
KingofZeal:	ALRIGHT I'M LEAVING
Master9000:	Start with my sister plz
JelloHammer:	Obviously
KingofZeal:	And pervy rain
Master9000:	Oh ok sounds goof
KingofZeal:	Obviously for mass murder of girlscouts
Deci:	cuz he's coming to murder rainy for being a perv
Master9000:	For what purpose?
Deci:	yo dudedon't joke about that
KingofZeal:	k bye
KingofZeal:	Little did you guys know what I needed to take care of was getting myself a gun
willofd2011:	Night lol ^w^
Master9000:	Scout is a girl
Master9000:	What
Deci:	scout.
Deci:	boyscout?
Deci:	girlscout
Deci:	out
Deci:	peace
JelloHammer:	Night
Master9000:	Soon™
Rainy:	Peace out
Rainy:	Have fun
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I need to go to bed soon and there's something completely unrelated to discord I need to take care of before bed so I'm gonna stop talking for the night.  Peace
Deci:	So she says
Rainy:	I've had a lot of preactice
Master9000:	Lol
Master9000:	I was about to say
KingofZeal:	In more ways than one I'm sure
Deci:	she is
KingofZeal:	You're pretty good at it
Rainy:	Distraction is my middle name
Master9000:	<3
KingofZeal:	Oh, I know
Deci:	they're not sorry
KingofZeal:	But ya'll keep me distracted, lol
Master9000:	Same
KingofZeal:	If I stopped being distracted every time I pulled up discord to try to work on it, I'd probably have finished days ago
Master9000:	Manage*
Master9000:	But since Eyan is as he is, I'll tell him that all he needs to do for that is set mee6 permission to delete messages in that channel off
Master9000:	We can make that happen rainy
Deci:	T.T *cries in despair*
Rainy:	I'll shut up now
KingofZeal:	Thus why once I finish setting everything up, realmaster is being left in charge, lol
Rainy:	I'm a horrible person, I'm sorry
Rainy:	Aware of anal?
KingofZeal:	Oh, I'm aware
Rainy:	Can we at least leave the throne room filterless? Is that even possible?
Deci:	see, that's the kinda mindset that'll burn you out though. You can delegate the small stuff, man
Rainy:	Heh, anal
KingofZeal:	I'm real anal about setting up community type stuff like this
KingofZeal:	I'd rather set everything up anyways Deci so it's fine
Deci:	or we could force realmaster to do so
Rainy:	I was worried that gif wouldn't work for a second
KingofZeal:	I've been trying to finish my discord stuff for days now
Deci:	if I knew how, I'd do it
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I'll get around to it eventually
Rainy:	https://media.tenor.co/images/14cebb65ac54e3934cdf1f5ec22ce454/tenor.gif
KingofZeal:	Ya'll aren't helping in that endevor
Deci:	cuz i don't know how
Deci:	then you should probably update the language filter to include other tenses
Rainy:	*rolling eyes anime gif*
Rainy:	No fucking
KingofZeal:	Contrary to what it may seem like, I actually do want to try to make things slightly more family friendly, no matter how much I'm failing in that endevor
Rainy:	Yeh
Rainy:	100%
Rainy:	Totally
KingofZeal:	Yes, it's totally needed
Master9000:	It's already shaped to fit the job <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deci:	unlike us men, who are like dogs
Deci:	women can make a lot of things look seductive
Deci:	could probably pull it off, tbh
Master9000:	Eyan do we really need fucк to be banned lol
Rainy:	*if that's possible*
Rainy:	*eats baguette seductively*
SuperGummying:	Screw the Russians
JelloHammer:	is that what they call them nowadays
SuperGummying:	And the British
JelloHammer:	'baguettes'
SuperGummying:	It was the Russians
Rainy:	Those baguettes
Deci:	and look where taht got him
Rainy:	We're all into frenchies, admit it
SuperGummying:	They didn't surrender when Napoleon was in power
Deci:	he's not into frenchies
KingofZeal:	There's a reason I didn't say Feck the French, lol
JelloHammer:	I get the civ memes
Rainy:	At least Feck the french is
Deci:	it is
JelloHammer:	I mean
Rainy:	I think it's a stream meme
Rainy:	Jesus, robits these days
JelloHammer:	why do people hate the french so much
Rainy:	Why is past tense okay
JelloHammer:	Genuine question
willofd2011:	Lol
JelloHammer:	LOL
Rainy:	Feck the french
Deci:	:p bots fucked you good rainy
Deci:	why be nice to them? their standard issue weapon is a white flag
Rainy:	Dammit
Deci:	wait, you're not invading them?
SuperGummying:	Eyan be nice to the French
Rainy:	Screw? How boring
KingofZeal:	Screw the French
Deci:	it is magical
Deci:	I can confirm that a mystical place called taiwan exists
SuperGummying:	I can confirm the French Empire
JelloHammer:	And the Vatican
JelloHammer:	I have been to India (Obviously), the middle east, Singapore, Malaysia, the UK, Italy and Switzerland
JelloHammer:	So I can confirm
JelloHammer:	I have been to all those places except America
Master9000:	Places not countries, young deci
Rainy:	Can you confirm it?
JelloHammer:	America, Not America and the Vatican
Deci:	the other half of the world doesn't exist, 'm sure
Master9000:	America because merica
China because that's where everything is made
Ukraine because I can confirm it exists
JelloHammer:	Only three places exist
Deci:	Wait, I thought it was America, Canada, and Mexico?
SuperGummying:	And the french empire
JelloHammer:	Actually let me rephrase that
JelloHammer:	And North Korea
SuperGummying:	My waifu is the best
Master9000:	There's only 3 real places, America, China, and Ukraine
JelloHammer:	Besides Waifus
JelloHammer:	Music is my life
Rainy:	UK is made up as well, but no
Master9000:	That doesn't exist?
SuperGummying:	I though jello lived in the U.K. <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Rainy:	Oh yeah I forgot that despite Jello living in some made up country he is still very versed in music.
JelloHammer:	"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."
Master9000:	If not for just a temporary disconnection from the treeeeeeeeeee
Master9000:	What is leave?
Rainy:	~~Hotel~~ Kingdom California I guess
JelloHammer:	Ever
JelloHammer:	You cant leave
KingofZeal:	Of course, did you expect otherwise?
JelloHammer:	No
Rainy:	I swear, I can't leave for five minutes
Rainy:	Are you guys talking about me in here?
Master9000:	You're welcome <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
willofd2011:	Hopefully lol
KingofZeal:	I'm sure the bot will consider your feelings and grant your wish
KingofZeal:	Sure, let's go with that
JelloHammer:	Did I do it correctly
Kireina:	?
Luckyskarm:	<@!116347313080762372> lol, how about "lets not" XD
willofd2011:	XD
JelloHammer:	Duly noted
KingofZeal:	By asking the bot kindly
KingofZeal:	Very carefully
JelloHammer:	How do you request songs?
KingofZeal:	I only joined cause of Rain
KingofZeal:	I'd rather not
Master9000:	Eyan listening to instalok???
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know why
Kireina:	either/or works
Kireina:	or do
Luckyskarm:	Just don't cause Darth unnessesary trouble^^
willofd2011:	Lol
Deci:	also, Ida, i love how you're both muted and deafened in the vc
Deci:	act like adults? taht's too hard. i'll just act like a slightly responsible child
willofd2011:	^^
KingofZeal:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	Can't just claim to be an adult, gotta act like one too
Luckyskarm:	I want you to be really nice today
SuperGummying:	just saying
SuperGummying:	tbh im almost an adult
Luckyskarm:	You act like your 10
willofd2011:	Night ^w^
SuperGummying:	i act like im 65
KingofZeal:	Good night
Luckyskarm:	night Swan
Luckyskarm:	Well you act like one😏
regal swan:	night all
SuperGummying:	im not a kid
SuperGummying:	lol
Luckyskarm:	<@!162952008712716288> i'm trusting you with the kids
KingofZeal:	The only thing I hate about tavern brawls like the current one is there is always that one class that is super op and just not worth playing against
Luckyskarm:	lol!
SuperGummying:	*kicks luckyskarm*
SuperGummying:	okay now
Luckyskarm:	Aww thx <@199725993416589313>^^
Neon Strike Kitty:	Funny thing is my draw was absolutely awful
Neon Strike Kitty:	Had an opponent concede on their first turn
KingofZeal:	That feel when you need to clear a HS quest quickly and your opponent concedes turn 2
SuperGummying:	<@!192233330652086272> happy mother's day mom
regal swan:	never play ygopro so it take me awhile anyway if u want to hit me up later today/tommorow
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm gonna need to build a new deck
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hmmm
regal swan:	fusions allowed
regal swan:	withought tuners  and all that shit
KingofZeal:	And of course Cadence went hardcore with Hearthstone when I trying Shadowverse before Un'Goro
Neon Strike Kitty:	Also I use YGOpro since that doesn't require me to buy cards
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I remember you liking it Deci.  I think Jello like it too.  Tried to get Lightning to try it but she never did
willofd2011:	?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Old schoolish?
Deci:	but that might be because i got like 200 free card packs for some reason
SuperGummying:	lillie face to cute to edit
SuperGummying:	someone wanna edit for me?
Deci:	I've actually liked it
willofd2011:	Plus a billion more other things on top of that lol
regal swan:	could we play old schoolish?
KingofZeal:	I should give shadowverse another go, kind of tried it and forgot about it
willofd2011:	Pretty much lol
Deci:	and some rules let you fuse some, and some rules let you sacrifice them, or upgrade them, o do like 10billion things with them
regal swan:	maybe tommorow ill play i kinda got burned by yugioh so yea
Neon Strike Kitty:	but some extra rules let you summon another one
Neon Strike Kitty:	*per
Neon Strike Kitty:	For the most part it's 1 minion ber turn
KingofZeal:	5 mana 5/5s are much easier to play
KingofZeal:	I'll stick to curvepiratesomethingstone
Deci:	Eyan, Imagine if in order to summon your 5/5, instead of paying 5 mana, you had to also have 1 specific other card on teh field, and another specific card in your hand.
willofd2011:	Haven't played in years tho
SuperGummying:	i used to play but i rage quit
willofd2011:	Kinda
Neon Strike Kitty:	Anyone else happen to play it and feel like dueling?
KingofZeal:	Probably why I don't play it
Neon Strike Kitty:	The game's famous for being unnecessarily complicated
Neon Strike Kitty:	and there's no mana, just unnecessarily convoluted summoning rules
Neon Strike Kitty:	they're just either dead or not dead
Neon Strike Kitty:	but unlike Hearthstone the minions don't have health
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's like Hearthstone in that you have health and minions
KingofZeal:	Something like that
willofd2011:	^
Deci:	You activate traps cards, occasionally
KingofZeal:	I don't know the first thing about YuGiOh
willofd2011:	Worth a try lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Awww
KingofZeal:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	Do you accept the challenge
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eyan, I challenge you to a game of YuGiOh
KingofZeal:	Also, cleared Touhou 16 Lunatic with Reimu, just Cirno remains
SuperGummying:	im active because i gotta show master i have more logic than him
Neon Strike Kitty:	it doesn't happen for me anymore
Neon Strike Kitty:	but now I work the night shift, so
KingofZeal:	I'm always here to be active, except when I'm not
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've known that feel
Master9000:	Same
regal swan:	why is it when i start going to bed it gets active?
Master9000:	I'm on my phone and God the audio sucks
SuperGummying:	master go to sleep
Neon Strike Kitty:	or yesterday morning, I guess
Master9000:	That's totally the only reason why
Neon Strike Kitty:	Citing last night as my evidence, excluding the Auschwitz card
KingofZeal:	I don't upload streams to YouTube 😉
Neon Strike Kitty:	What's really sad is when I'm the most innocent of a group
SuperGummying:	you should upload that to youtube
SuperGummying:	eyan last night stream was innocent
SuperGummying:	...
willofd2011:	Oh look a pretty butterfly
KingofZeal:	I am clearly pure and innocent
SuperGummying:	will tell her
willofd2011:	Lol
regal swan:	my point proven
SuperGummying:	demon lord
SuperGummying:	ask um
SuperGummying:	gummy is though
regal swan:	no one pure innocent
SuperGummying:	gummy is innocent though
regal swan:	innocent my butt
SuperGummying:	but gummy no pyschopath
Master9000:	sounds a bit pyschopathic talking in third person
willofd2011:	We'll try but no promises lol
MajesticEclipse02:	Same though lol, goodnight everyone, my Internet is about to die anyways
SuperGummying:	he is so innocent
SuperGummying:	why would little old gummy do anything
Master9000:	make sure gummy doesnt get anyone else killed while im away

SuperGummying:	im kinda ashamed to have the tsm icon currently
Zek:	dont know if I should root for the Celtics or Wizards tomorrow
Pogi:	np m8
Kugallyblitz:	thanks pogi btw for the explanation
Inferno:	*I play competetive I was just being a cuck*
SuperGummying:	i used to play ahri a lot before i became like really one trick
KingofZeal:	Ahri is suprisingly a hard champion to play, or maybe I just suck at her while wishing I was faker at her
Pogi:	How do you think I became Smash Brother Champion
Inferno:	good to know its just as good in league
Inferno:	dont get hit is the best advice in smash 4 tbh
KingofZeal:	But you have to know what you're doing to some extent
KingofZeal:	Yes, Ahri wins at 6
SuperGummying:	remember
SuperGummying:	i listen to eyan
Pogi:	You can win at 6 I think
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	then again eyan this is gummy
KingofZeal:	^
Master9000:	its not like you ever want to be snared
KingofZeal:	"Don't get hit" is pretty obvious advice.  😛
KingofZeal:	I mean, it's pretty boring advice
SuperGummying:	k i'll try to remember that thanks eyan
SuperGummying:	yup lux mid
KingofZeal:	As long as you don't get snared, I'm pretty sure that's a good lane
Master9000:	they dont know
SuperGummying:	could be a support though but i think it's a mid
SuperGummying:	lux
KingofZeal:	oh, who are you against
Master9000:	what
SuperGummying:	im ahri
KingofZeal:	Who are you?
SuperGummying:	wish me luck
SuperGummying:	ahri mid
SuperGummying:	alright
Pogi:	Alternatively, if somebody calls you a feeder, then that means you died a lot, and gave the other players kills. That is bad.
Pogi:	<@303048546179874816> Basically means that the player has a lot of kills, so they are fed in the way that they are ahead of everybody else. So if the team is fed, then that means everybody on the team has a lot of kills.
SuperGummying:	ahhhh it's gg
SuperGummying:	both
Kugallyblitz:	what does the term fed, in LoL mean anyway, when you feed someone or some team?
SuperGummying:	but they are soooo fed
SuperGummying:	only the jg and my friend and me are doing good
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm just in the chat for the music
Inferno:	and i was support
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got everyone muted anyways
SuperGummying:	darius is feeding
Inferno:	I mean, I went 1/8/7 because my FPS tanks during fights
Master9000:	do it
SuperGummying:	janna is being dumb
willofd2011:	*tries not to sing along*
Neon Strike Kitty:	It was fun
SuperGummying:	6/7
SuperGummying:	ugh so bad
Neon Strike Kitty:	The enemy team was taking the drake and then they were getting killed by me
Inferno:	He fed top lane in the one game he played
Aqua033:	Video games aren't fun
Aqua033:	What are you talking about
Master9000:	he sat under turret and talked in dm's and edited video
Inferno:	And me
Master9000:	i queued with gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I managed a decent Elder Drake steal
KingofZeal:	Lol, you answered before I asked
KingofZeal:	And who carried who?  😛
Neon Strike Kitty:	he carried me with Lulu but I contributed to teamfights so that's nice
Neon Strike Kitty:	I queued with DesertSpirit earlier
Master9000:	somewhere
Master9000:	thats illegal
Master9000:	no way
KingofZeal:	Shocker, video games are fun
MajesticEclipse02:	
KingofZeal:	Probably because you actually had some fun
MajesticEclipse02:	Guys check out this awesome air guitar

Master9000:	everything except for what he can take offense to flies over him now
Neon Strike Kitty:	he's probably trying to give you advice, but I wasn't there so I can't tell

Master9000:	proc t-lords to proc ludens lmao
cadance:	idk, phreak's an idiot <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	or something

Aqua033:	Because I just got home
Aqua033:	No, I haven't
cadance:	you must not have been watching that MSI game

Master9000:	5 way tie tho
Deino Mite:	inb4 4 way tie for 3rd place
Master9000:	schrodinger's league match
SuperGummying:	I mean c9 wouldn't have been able to beat skt as well

cadance:	was that a glitch in the matrix?
Master9000:	your need to specify your knowledge of it argues for the contrary
SuperGummying:	I knew that
Master9000:	they dont need override permissions to talk in a channel that is read only for `@everyone`
Master9000:	yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	and that's not even getting into server settings
Neon Strike Kitty:	Can access, message and modify every channel
Neon Strike Kitty:	I do
Master9000:	you know how the role admin works right?
Master9000:	those were fine
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **willofd2011 leveled up!**
Lightning:	Hey guys, how're you all doing tonight?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just changed the everyone and Animal Man permissions

Neon Strike Kitty:	*is tilted about Eurovision*
KingofZeal:	JK TSM is trash
Master9000:	faker?
Master9000:	i got a 2v1 double kill it was over 5 mins after that
Deino Mite:	what were you saying about it not being a land slide?
Master9000:	and theres the ff20
Animal_Glue_:	it's a lie
Master9000:	*smells cake*
SuperGummying:	Well this is off to a bad start
KingofZeal:	TSM actually has a team comp that is "TSM" like so this game should at least not be a landslide
Deino Mite:	thats really bad for tsm
Deino Mite:	skt lost to fw?!
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
Master9000:	against gp graves
Master9000:	i just got a double kill 2v1 <:FeelsGoodMan:305609186996125696>
SuperGummying:	I think they can win
SuperGummying:	Alright tsm
KingofZeal:	It's going to start out as that, but I'll leave the option open for expansion
Master9000:	is the affinity system going to be based on fire water shadow lightning or is that something seperate?
Master9000:	she just walked back in when i opened the fridge lmao
Master9000:	oh wow i didnt even know the cat was outside
Master9000:	how long have these damn acer sponsorships been going on?
Sky:	G2 <:4Head:230182706187599872>
Master9000:	cant wait for ADC Rammus in solo q
Master9000:	this reminds me of my teammates...
KingofZeal:	By overstaying
KingofZeal:	And threw super hard
KingofZeal:	G2 went full GAM
KingofZeal:	LOOOOOL

Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
KingofZeal:	I'll let you know if I want you to do anything
KingofZeal:	Or at least, I still want to look over everything once more
KingofZeal:	Nah, I'll do it
Master9000:	eyan want me to set up the banished permission for the rest of the text channels?
KingofZeal:	The irony is, they've disrespected all game so when they start respecting, it allows a Baron, lol
Master9000:	its all just ANELE
KingofZeal:	But G2 is clearly not respecting GAM right now
Master9000:	lmfao twitch chat
KingofZeal:	Oh, it's definitely still a game
MajesticEclipse02:	Never mind I wouldn't get it
MajesticEclipse02:	Oh league stuf
cadance:	only 2k gold
cadance:	i think g2 can still come back

MajesticEclipse02:	?
KingofZeal:	G2
KingofZeal:	Hey guys, want to hear a joke?
MajesticEclipse02:	I made potatoes
Luckyskarm:	*puts Gummy in Darth's room*
Luckyskarm:	*sigh*
SuperGummying:	*beats luckyskarm*
Luckyskarm:	Don't sass me.
Master9000:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
MajesticEclipse02:	Excuse you ?
Luckyskarm:	Be nice for mother
MajesticEclipse02:	I think
MajesticEclipse02:	I'm a not nice person
MajesticEclipse02:	Never
willofd2011:	^ lol
Luckyskarm:	Kids, be nice to eachother
MajesticEclipse02:	Myfut
Master9000:	Oof
MajesticEclipse02:	*glares at dragonite*
MajesticEclipse02:	Theows
Master9000:	What wasn't English?
MajesticEclipse02:	English people.
Master9000:	You missed
Dragonite:	/me theows Master at a tree
Master9000:	And idk about kids at knives
Master9000:	Throwing trees at kids is fine if you're strong enough to do it anyway lmao
Dragonite:	what about throwing kids at knives or trees at kids
Master9000:	That happened and almost flew back to me
Master9000:	If the knife it's the tree blunt end it can bounce back
Master9000:	Go for it but be careful
cadance:	but can i throw knives at kids trees?
Master9000:	Don't throw knives at trees kids
SuperGummying:	yes
cadance:	did froskurinn really just make a mighty ducks reference
Kireina:	They are the CLG of (whatever region they come from [China?])
Kireina:	FW are actually fucking insane I don't understand LMFAO
Inferno:	FW OP pls nerf
Master9000:	This is how you know when you threw a knife with adequate force
Inferno:	LOL
Kireina:	Nah they gonna fucking burst out the gates like WE WONT LOST TO ANYONE ELSE
KingofZeal:	Maybe SKT will be tilted enough that they lose to TSM, HA, HA, HAHAHAHAHA
Kireina:	fucking gods
Kireina:	Korean Slayers
Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	also FW
Kireina:	Basically whenever Vlad and other champs got reworked
SuperGummying:	well lost that trial
Kireina:	back when they did the mage reworks/mini-reworks
Kireina:	That was like
Rainy:	Yeah, that was the pinnacle of rito balance TM
cadance:	or am i hallucinating
cadance:	didn't they put something on syndra a couple patches ago that let her pick up multiple balls with her w?
KingofZeal:	v_v
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	get you rmind out of the gutter
Rainy:	Yeah cadance, jeez
cadance:	uh i meant the creative juices
KingofZeal:	This place is supposed to be somewhat family friendly
KingofZeal:	Cadance please
Rainy:	Now TSM is gonna beat FW in a fluke and the memes will flow wildly
cadance:	pants can come later, better to sit on a towel for now and feel the freedom to just let the juices flow <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Rainy:	You aren't wrong, but I need to go shopping after this game, so pants are important
cadance:	or just no pants
Rainy:	I need a change of pants, that was so clean
Rainy:	Faker got inseced
KingofZeal:	FW have always been the one team that can beat them
KingofZeal:	And on that day, Skt got dumpstered
Rainy:	Cancer is always meta
cadance:	can't believe tank fizz is meta
Master9000:	russian hackers lmao
cadance:	i just paused unpaused and it came back
cadance:	yeah it did
Rainy:	yup
Master9000:	weird
Master9000:	did stream just black out for anyone else?
Rainy:	Probably not since ANX
Rainy:	I can't remember the last time I saw an impressive Baron call
Rainy:	That baron was smart
Master9000:	*continues singing*
Master9000:	sorry lol
Luckyskarm:	My ears hurt lol
Master9000:	get musiced
Luckyskarm:	DARTH WTF
Master9000:	lmao
Master9000:	lmao the last ratio change was in 1.0.0.143
Rainy:	Shaddup tatsu
Rainy:	Really good except when it matters
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Rainy leveled up!**
Rainy:	Huni's making me nostalgic for IMT
Aqua033:	>Hearthstone
>Balance
Ha
Master9000:	yeah her patches have barely any number changes http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Orianna
KingofZeal:	Kind of like how Blizzard used Paladin a half year ago when balancing arena
cadance:	she still plays exactly the same as she did when i started playing
KingofZeal:	It'd not suprise me that Riot chose certain champions as benchmarks for balance, pretty sure Ori would be one of those
cadance:	has ori even had anything done to her in the last few years?
Deino Mite:	i really dont think skt can lose though
Master9000:	just changes the meta
Master9000:	i dont thinkg rito nerfs her anyway
KingofZeal:	I suppose I can't object to that
cadance:	rofl
Rainy:	playing the long con
Rainy:	Faker's just making sure Rito doesn't nerf her
Master9000:	ignoring sleep in this
Master9000:	my level of energy is a sin curve with the highest being in the evening/night and hte lowest when i wake up
SuperGummying:	master i still did something
KingofZeal:	Faker is making Orianna not look broken, this actually saddens me
Rainy:	FW has no chill
Luckyskarm:	You sound dead
cadance:	FW just got a 3 for nothing fight and skt is still even in gold
Master9000:	just not in an excited state
Deino Mite:	and any normal person would save lillie
Master9000:	im awake
Luckyskarm:	Darth,really. Take a shower or something you need to wake tf up
Master9000:	you pressed buttons in the way the game intended you to
Master9000:	not really
SuperGummying:	i stop team skull from hurting lillie
SuperGummying:	i show courage
SuperGummying:	alright master
SuperGummying:	would always have it his way
SuperGummying:	he was a horible artist
Master9000:	yeah he just popped up on my recommended friends list
Luckyskarm:	You sound sleepy, if your awake for 3 hours you really shouldn't be this tired
SuperGummying:	i remember him yelling at me
SuperGummying:	dart explosion...................
Master9000:	why
Luckyskarm:	Take a cold shower then
Master9000:	i just woke up 3 hours ago
Luckyskarm:	Go to bed
Luckyskarm:	Darth, you sound so tired
Master9000:	i still like mercs for the tenacity on darius
cadance:	except sorcs
Master9000:	is dart explosion ever here anymore?
cadance:	what happened to tabi that it's pretty much the only boots anyone gets anymore
Master9000:	is riot ok with the tabi meta on marksmen lol
Deino Mite:	^
KingofZeal:	So lose FW damnit
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	Beating SKT increases your odds of getting out of groups by 10 fold so it's bad if anybody beats them at this point
Deino Mite:	im watching boku no hero adademia right now so i didnt see it
SuperGummying:	what did i miss?
SuperGummying:	alright saved lillie in episode 40
KingofZeal:	That was shit
KingofZeal:	Yea
Inferno:	riiip
cadance:	HLY JESUS SHIT BALLS
cadance:	THAT FLASH WAS SO BAD
cadance:	FAKER WHATWLRKASFKLSDAF
KingofZeal:	I think if TSM just stopped being nervous and just played the damned game, they could beat any team minus SKT
Deino Mite:	and tsm do stand a chance against we in a series
Deino Mite:	and g2 gets 4
KingofZeal:	They'll probably lose regardless, but at least they'rd be a chance of it being a series
Deino Mite:	tsm gets 3
Deino Mite:	so 1 and 2 seeds are skt and we
KingofZeal:	If they get 4th, they're just gonna lose to SKT in bracket
Inferno:	yeah, they do
Deino Mite:	i want to see an NA team win worlds at some point in my lifetime
Inferno:	but Its more a matter of if they will smarten up
KingofZeal:	TSM needs the 2/3 seed
KingofZeal:	The problem is
Inferno:	I want to see TSM go further
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	inb4 tsm loses to the russians and brazilians at worlds
KingofZeal:	Yea
KingofZeal:	Well, if the beat TSM, they'd probably be through no problem
Deino Mite:	if tsm beat skt, its almost certain they make it out of groups
KingofZeal:	It'd help if TSM beat them later, not that I see that ever happening
Inferno:	SKT best team tbh
KingofZeal:	Ironically, it's important for SKT to keep dumpstering everyone else
Master9000:	if it was a 50 games per team tournament that wouldve been good
cadance:	imo
cadance:	3-4 isn't terrible at this point in the game
cadance:	systematically picked GAM apart bit by bit
KingofZeal:	Yeah, it only took them 7 games
Deino Mite:	tsm has a good chance at making it to brackets
Inferno:	good stuff
Deino Mite:	ya
cadance:	they dominated
Inferno:	Heard about that
cadance:	won?
Strike:	
KingofZeal:	In other news, TSM won, facinate
Master9000:	its a damn nickname
Master9000:	i just told you
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	i use it as a test dummy as well
Strike:	its just the nickname
Strike:	and?
SuperGummying:	i like the other name
SuperGummying:	master
Kireina:	I don't really see anything wrong w/ goals so long as it generally pertains to the stream and enhances the experience for all
Strike:	nickname changed for more accuracy
Pogi:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L2BDGL-kpo
KingofZeal:	I dunno, there's a fine line with that kind of stuff, but the line shifts based on the person who's actually leading the channel.  Doing something like a donation goal or something though isn't a terrible idea in itself
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	thats a funny way of spelling gummy
Pogi:	If you want to sell out, you have to do it better than the Game Grumps
Luckyskarm:	Lmao, my volume is maxed
Master9000:	i have all the volume controls on my comp maxed out and i can still barely hear luckskarm
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	Ooh, level 15
KingofZeal:	I think so long as I keep things realistic and in good fun, I can make things work fairly well.
KingofZeal:	That's actually fair enough
Master9000:	just for realism, selling out is only if you get paid to do something you **dont** believe in
KingofZeal:	lol
Luckyskarm:	F*ck everything
Luckyskarm:	Just go wild
KingofZeal:	There are a lot of cool ideas that can work with that stuff
KingofZeal:	It's kind of like, I want to be just a bit of a sellout, but I don't want to be a bit of a sellout, lol
Master9000:	*links all of the bit explosions again as well*
Luckyskarm:	^
Master9000:	*cites the cup from last night*
KingofZeal:	I could do #sellout ideas like that, but that seems #sellouty
KingofZeal:	Lol
Luckyskarm:	We'll just donate more bits to make you agree
KingofZeal:	Part of the reason I agreed to it is I wasn't ready to end stream but I was done with League
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	not sure thats quite how the math works out
KingofZeal:	I'd say doubtful
Luckyskarm:	So, there's a 50% every Friday we can convince you to play CAH?
KingofZeal:	This is true
Master9000:	in varying amounts lol
KingofZeal:	I tend to drink every Friday.
Luckyskarm:	Be drunk more often then XD
KingofZeal:	Maybe something like that
KingofZeal:	That also would not have worked if I wasn't drunk
Master9000:	once a year thing?
KingofZeal:	That was actually a hell of a lot of fun.  I'm not making a habit of that but as a one time thing, it was pretty awesome
Master9000:	did u watch the clips on the black omen?
KingofZeal:	Nah, I won the second game
Luckyskarm:	Eyan, aren't you just dead from our CAH game last night😏
willofd2011:	Same
Master9000:	minus allergies
Master9000:	me every morning
KingofZeal:	Also allergies
KingofZeal:	Tired and dead on the inside
Master9000:	?
KingofZeal:	What is life
KingofZeal:	Oof
SuperGummying:	lol
Master9000:	oof
Luckyskarm:	*resets Gummy*
SuperGummying:	never
Aqua033:	Do it
Master9000:	go to your room or im reseting your points <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Luckyskarm:	I will not take this disrespect
SuperGummying:	i will
Luckyskarm:	Don't argue with your mother
SuperGummying:	no
Luckyskarm:	Get the f*ck back
Aqua033:	Ah, shit
SuperGummying:	*leaves the room*
Aqua033:	We'll lock the door if we have to
Master9000:	^
Aqua033:	You damn well better stay in there
SuperGummying:	i won't stay
SuperGummying:	never
Ayana:	​hes not here
Master9000:	=room check supergummying
Luckyskarm:	Then stay in there
SuperGummying:	i am in my room
Master9000:	^
Luckyskarm:	You should already be in your room
SuperGummying:	i would go in but i rather not have both of you send me to my room
Master9000:	sure
Master9000:	eyan and i agreed for last stream for me to be in there that i would stay muted
Luckyskarm:	Would you talk to me?
SuperGummying:	than we know for sure they have a chance
Master9000:	<@!192233330652086272> yeah when theres someone to talk to
SuperGummying:	if tsm beat skt
Deino Mite:	but g2 and tsm have a better score than fw and gam
Rainy:	Who knew that it was a good idea to play around Bjerg and Hauntzer , huh?
Deino Mite:	then it will be close between g2, tsm, fw, and gam
Deino Mite:	its gonna be skt and we
SuperGummying:	hmmm
SuperGummying:	3-4
Deino Mite:	TSM might actually make it out of groups
Deino Mite:	that feels good
cadance:	dayum tsm stomped that shit
SuperGummying:	TSM
Luckyskarm:	<@162952008712716288> do you ever talk on vc?
SuperGummying:	tsm is doing really good
cadance:	man the cameras make it so hard to see
cadance:	oh wait that's actually a lion on her neck
SuperGummying:	However you spell that
SuperGummying:	Frostkurinn
SuperGummying:	You mean
cadance:	lmfao "consistent? their first two games were complete opposites" > "well we actually have to define consistency in this case, strangely enough"
cadance:	i wish i could see her arm piece better
cadance:	i love panther tattoos

Inferno:	Quebec sucks tbh
cadance:	somewhere near-ish quebec but not quebec cuz he hates quebec

Master9000:	how did u do that
Luckyskarm:	Darth, can you do this?
Inferno:	there was one here
Neon Strike Kitty:	So there's an actual storm here
Inferno:	good idea
Aqua033:	Also, I feel like we should move this to <#311411150611021824>
willofd2011:	Never leave any good and fed champion in general alone ever lol
Aqua033:	<Is a Fiora main
Inferno:	True
Aqua033:	Never leave a good Fiora alone, either
Inferno:	they have stacking down to an art form I swear
willofd2011:	Lol
Inferno:	***Ever***
Inferno:	Never leave a *Good* nasus alone
willofd2011:	Wow
Inferno:	he 2 shot the nexus that game....
willofd2011:	O.o
Inferno:	"I hear the Nexus Gives 12 Stacks"

"Target Aquired"
Inferno:	he has also gotten 4000 stacks as Nasus in a 30 minute game
Inferno:	he just doesnt try
Inferno:	I mean, probably
Aqua033:	If you can successfully run AD Bard on a controller, you can play competitive eSports
Inferno:	he PIONEERED the AD bard idea
willofd2011:	Dang O.o lol
Inferno:	we think he could be almost challenger if he wanted to be
Aqua033:	They must be easily actually diamond
Aqua033:	How
willofd2011:	Nice lol
Inferno:	fun fact, i have a friend who got to gold with AD Bard on controller
Aqua033:	Hell, I'd say that if you can't get 150 CS by 20, you need to work on CS
willofd2011:	That's sort of why I prefer top lane lol
Aqua033:	If you can't even get 100CS by 20 minutes as a laner, your CS is really, really bad and you need to work on it
Aqua033:	That was a really, really bad game
Inferno:	taste. the. rainbow
willofd2011:	Lol
Inferno:	lol
Inferno:	I mean, im a **LUX**/Sona main, I think I know how to intentionally kill steal
willofd2011:	And do less of the supporting stuff lol
Inferno:	I basically play Fill tbh
willofd2011:	I always steal kills and stuff unintentionally and sometimes intentionally lol
Inferno:	I find it fun.... which is weird
willofd2011:	I can't play support for the life of me lol
Inferno:	maybe both
Inferno:	...or slow
Inferno:	sounds pretty bad
Aqua033:	When you have 77CS
Aqua033:	At least you're not the jungler with the most kills, least deaths, and most CS in a 20 minute game
Aqua033:	I mean
Inferno:	which makes it even worse
Inferno:	and I'm not lvl 30, so no ranked
Inferno:	lol
Inferno:	especially since im support
Kugallyblitz:	D:

SuperGummying:	The only thing I know about that is the music
Kireina:	LOL
Master9000:	for even more proof of why muskets suck
Master9000:	look at 20 minutes into the first pirates of the carribean movie
SuperGummying:	Lucky you aren't the boss of me
Master9000:	gummy
Kireina:	At the very least he couldn't possibly have lost 490 duels in a row
Master9000:	yeah it was (***makes up some random number***)
Master9000:	oh right
Kireina:	I thought it was (***makes up some random number***)
Kireina:	But
Master9000:	you already lost a total of what 5 duels or so?
Luckyskarm:	Gummy, no
SuperGummying:	Let's duel
SuperGummying:	*pulls out a sword*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm dueling
Kugallyblitz:	cos food

Master9000:	Evolution lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	The real reason is that I'm lazy
willofd2011:	Food <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
SuperGummying:	....general is still high rank though
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm just a general
Kugallyblitz:	Oh man I love food
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't help
Dragonite:	brb food
SuperGummying:	I would dig a hole
Kugallyblitz:	You should say NO cos jumping off cliffs is SO overrated it's all about CLIMBING UP THE CLIFFS NOW
willofd2011:	XD
Dragonite:	_gives Gummy an F for trying_
SuperGummying:	Fall while laughing mid air
SuperGummying:	Jump across
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	I would run off and start laughing
Dragonite:	_takes notes_
Kugallyblitz:	gummy
Kugallyblitz:	there's a correct answer to determine your common sense
Kugallyblitz:	You see a cliff and all of your friends jump off, do you jump off? 
Yes?
No?
Luckyskarm:	There's nothing to tell
SuperGummying:	Your turn to tell them
SuperGummying:	Blitz
Kugallyblitz:	here's the common sense test
Aqua033:	You don't, though
SuperGummying:	Tell them I have common sense
SuperGummying:	Ida help me
Kugallyblitz:	just some stuff not a lot, but some
Master9000:	stuff
Neon Strike Kitty:	What did I miss?
Dragonite:	the truth hurts, matey
SuperGummying:	Dragonite shut it
Master9000:	could be
Dragonite:	it's not that gummy refuses to use his common sense, it's just that he doesn't have any to begin with
Kireina:	like this
SuperGummying:	Doesn't mean gummy will listen to you
Kireina:	Assuming gummy does his usual thing and refuse common sense
SuperGummying:	Gummy does understand
Luckyskarm:	Damn
Luckyskarm:	Oooooh
Kireina:	A feline could probably still understand it better then gummy
Master9000:	ok im gonna ask my cat what sin 45 is
Luckyskarm:	Lies
Kireina:	In general
Master9000:	for a feline?
Kireina:	Trig is pretty easy though >_>
Master9000:	why are you wasting your time with it
Kireina:	I was about to stay wrong chat, but I guess it sorta applies here anyways 🤔
Master9000:	its like trying to teach a cat how to do trig
Kireina:	^
Master9000:	yeah hes hopeless
SuperGummying:	Master isn't going to teach me anything
Aqua033:	I've been trying to get a new computer for a few years now
Master9000:	gummy im gonna sneak into your house one day and wipe your hard drives and have them install Mac OS
Aqua033:	In my defense
Luckyskarm:	Darth, we must teach Gummy a lesson
SuperGummying:	Master you have an iPhone......
SuperGummying:	Yay Mac OS
Master9000:	Apple
Aqua033:	Hmm?
Master9000:	well that explains why youre losing <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Aqua033:	My monitor when asked about homework:
SuperGummying:	Lucky are you the new provoker?
Luckyskarm:	Don't let Gummy control you
SuperGummying:	It sucks
Master9000:	my monitor:
SuperGummying:	No it's not
Master9000:	me: yeah
Master9000:	parents: are you doing homework?
Dragonite:	it's very well fine-tuned

Dragonite:	_'s bullskitty alarm starts acting up again_
SuperGummying:	I know how to coach
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Master9000:	Could you do better gummy?
SuperGummying:	But really flash wolves
SuperGummying:	I mean I knew they would lose to skt
SuperGummying:	Tsm lost....
Kugallyblitz:	Dragonite should be the general of poking things. his job is just poking things in general. This is why he is the General  of poking things, general poker. <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you been demoted to field officer
Master9000:	Shit I lost another knife
Dragonite:	i'm the General of Getting On Your Nerves
SuperGummying:	Bella is the second in command and master is a marshal in charge of artillery
regal swan:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	Ooh I did a thing!
SuperGummying:	You lead cavalry
SuperGummying:	Blitz is now the new marshal
Dragonite:	_pokes gummy_
SuperGummying:	You are demoted to general
SuperGummying:	Ida you are also no longer marshal
Master9000:	all she did was stare at me for a bit
Master9000:	thats more than we have gotten out of gummy
regal swan:	lol me too
Kugallyblitz:	every time dragonite pokes things I just imagine a big dragonite just poking something like he's not allowed 👌
Dragonite:	_pokes remote detonater bomb_
Kugallyblitz:	oh boy oh boy
regal swan:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	and of course that's what makes me level up
Neon Strike Kitty:	And this is why I hid a remote detonated bomb in your left arm
Aqua033:	I mean, it kinda is
SuperGummying:	This is why you are no longer my second in command
SuperGummying:	Ida
regal swan:	yes cancel invasion
Neon Strike Kitty:	Actually, screw it. They haven't figured it out yet so we could cancel it while we still have time.
Neon Strike Kitty:	The russian invasion is already well under way, and you want to cancel it?
SuperGummying:	Later Bella
regal swan:	later
Kugallyblitz:	Later bella
superheronerd:	Well, I'm off to watch a game about space and aliens. Later nerds
regal swan:	that sucks
Luckyskarm:	*throws gummy in his room*
Kireina:	However, I had to buy new clothes...and a new keyboard (piano)
Kireina:	Thankfully they were in the closet
regal swan:	insert katy parry joke here
Kireina:	it was not fun.
Kireina:	my cousin set off a set of fire rockets in my room
Kireina:	assuming you don't set off explosions
regal swan:	lol
Kireina:	Probably
Kireina:	I would've died by now
Kireina:	if you were my cousin
Kireina:	My cousin is also like 7 so.. hmm I should think of a new example
SuperGummying:	I'm your cousin
Master9000:	Hmmm
Kireina:	That someone is my cousin z_z
SuperGummying:	Call off the Russian invasion
Kireina:	They also do a thing called not listening like a certain someone I know <:Thonk:281612113485627392>
SuperGummying:	Oh wait I did scream to Moscow! The other day
Dragonite:	why the hell _wouldn't_ they be in Russia
regal swan:	because russia
Kireina:	Because they do things called running
SuperGummying:	Are they in Russia?
SuperGummying:	Why the hell
SuperGummying:	Ida
Kireina:	Cause I'm like don't tell me if he's in a higher grade or I'll take the fun I make of his spelling/grammar seriously.
Master9000:	Something like that
Kireina:	What grade is gumgum in again? I forget he's in like 10th grade or something right? <:Thonk:281612113485627392>
Master9000:	I will fire you if you don't give me 12 modern ak-47 s within the next hour
Kugallyblitz:	Gummy D:
Luckyskarm:	*Gummy is dead.*
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Neon Strike Kitty:	How do I give you the raptors if they're in the middle of Russia right now?
Dragonite:	_feeds Gummy to the raptors_
Kireina:	Oh wait I just remembered we exposed gummy as a botter not a spammer <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Master9000:	Gummy
SuperGummying:	The raptors
SuperGummying:	You don't give me
SuperGummying:	Fire you if
SuperGummying:	I will
Master9000:	The museum gets a lot out of them
SuperGummying:	Now
SuperGummying:	Give me the raptors
Kireina:	Lucky might be a bigger spammer then Gummy at the rate he's going <:Thonkang:269201062475464704>

SuperGummying:	I'll bring raptors to your house
SuperGummying:	Lucky I swear you tell me that one more time
Kireina:	Assassin
Neon Strike Kitty:	btw I need a new volunteer

Neon Strike Kitty:	I tie someone to a spinning target, throw three knives and all of them hit the person
Master9000:	Start writing stuff down
SuperGummying:	You said bow and arrows
Kugallyblitz:	I Is even more worsier then bellz can
Kireina:	Tell me that when you relearn English.
Neon Strike Kitty:	*can throw knives better than that*
Master9000:	I told you that five times now

Kireina:	Indeed
superheronerd:	Yeah go study.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Go study
SuperGummying:	Gummy doesn't take orders from anyone
SuperGummying:	Lucky you go to your room
superheronerd:	It is definitely a mix
Kireina:	Although, it ends up being a mix of both.
Kireina:	It's just spelling errors he refuses to acknowledge
Luckyskarm:	Bad child. Go to your room
Kireina:	It's not even grammar half the time
Neon Strike Kitty:	I tried teaching you but you didn't learn
Luckyskarm:	*pinches gummies ears again*
Kireina:	It's hopeless (not really, but quite high)
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've given up
Kireina:	Please don't
SuperGummying:	Ida teach me
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Has basically given up on teaching Gummy proper grammar*
Kireina:	*Still hasn't fixed spelling/grammar mistake*
SuperGummying:	*pinches lucky hard*
Kireina:	It's ok just know that you have better grammar than GumGum.
Luckyskarm:	He had it coming
Luckyskarm:	Don't care.
Kugallyblitz:	Im sad now

SuperGummying:	What do you mean? That's says anyone
Kireina:	ear pinching hurts like a bitch how could you
Kireina:	Yo
Luckyskarm:	*pinches Gummies ears* bad child

SuperGummying:	*kicks blitz again*
Kugallyblitz:	no gummeroo D:
Kireina:	Yeah I have no idea either
Kireina:	yes ( *I say yes, but I have no idea what you're trying to say. Gummy can't abuse anymore or Gummy can abuse anyone or Gummy can't abuse anyone)
Neon Strike Kitty:	What?
SuperGummying:	Gummy can abuse anyone

An exception was made in 2015, when Australia was allowed to compete as a guest entrant as part of the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the event.[6][7][8]

Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know if there's specific ones for them in English
Kireina:	I wasn't sure what to call baby sheep and if there was like a he/she specific name for them
Neon Strike Kitty:	Two girls

Kireina:	Wait, if he bots in this case he wouldn't be a spammer, but a botter. <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
Kireina:	Not here? Must be using a spam bot. <:Kappa:305551256104206336>

Master9000:	I'm actually providing useful info
SuperGummying:	You are a spammer
willofd2011:	Lol
Kireina:	And of course is nowhere near as worse as true attempt at spam
Master9000:	Your point?
SuperGummying:	Master you have more points than me
Kireina:	With the way you type it could be considered spam, but like I said it could definitely be worse.
Master9000:	Yeah you are
SuperGummying:	No I'm not a spammer
Kireina:	Doing pretty good, hella bored in class tho, and we're trying to convince gumgum that he's a spammer (could definitely be worse.)

Kireina:	I know you joke about beating people, but uh we all know how that would go, unless of course you been lifting then I'd be afraid (whether or not you actually are because hey the internet amirite 🤔 ) edit: fixed ofcourse
SuperGummying:	Than he should admit it
SuperGummying:	If he's afraid that I will beat him
Kireina:	because you'd still be on slow mode LOL
Kireina:	That wouldn't exactly help your cause
Kireina:	I didn't think he was serious lmao
SuperGummying:	Master I will spam you so much if you try anything
Kireina:	Wait is there an actual slow mode for discord? LOL
superheronerd:	Need, really. Didn't have breakfast yet
SuperGummying:	Help
SuperGummying:	Ugh
Master9000:	It's for science gummy

Kireina:	Should have? or need 🤔
superheronerd:	I should have food
Kireina:	Pls do
SuperGummying:	No
SuperGummying:	Master
Master9000:	I may put on slow mode for gummy lmao
SuperGummying:	I do it everywhere
SuperGummying:	You seen it before
SuperGummying:	....but Bella I always do it
Kireina:	Honestly
superheronerd:	Bad
superheronerd:	Noooo

SuperGummying:	That
SuperGummying:	Never do
willofd2011:	How are you guys doing lol ^w^
SuperGummying:	I would
Kireina:	Like honestly LOL you'd be that person texting someone a paragraph but feels the need to send them the text in 3-4 words 🤔
superheronerd:	4 parts? How long would that take?
MajesticEclipse02:	I need food
Kireina:	Do you see how short your sentences tend to be
SuperGummying:	No I'm not
Kireina:	Yes
Kireina:	you gonna die
SuperGummying:	Do I look like a spammer to you?
Kireina:	LMfao
SuperGummying:	I'm a spammer
SuperGummying:	Well according to master and ida
Master9000:	There's 4 fucking parts to the ap physics exam
Master9000:	Also I checked the schedule during the exam
Kireina:	Cause you know College and shit
Master9000:	Old news Keepo

SuperGummying:	I want food
Master9000:	Time for food
Master9000:	I just did an ap exam
SuperGummying:	I'm doing nothing as well
MajesticEclipse02:	I have nothing to do, I'm in ceramics and literally the class is dead, there's nothing to do since we have nothing to complete
SuperGummying:	I'm goofing off in class
MajesticEclipse02:	I feel like this class should be over right now
MajesticEclipse02:	Holy heck my perspective e of time has slowed down so much in this class
SuperGummying:	<@191299047896776704> what did he say?
Deino Mite:	Gummy, my hero academia quoted napoleon
Deino Mite:	and when we are allowed on phones
Deino Mite:	depends how much wifi is at the place
Deino Mite:	so, im heading off to cape cod on a class trip so you might not hear much from me over the next two days
cadance:	clear a wave in half a second
cadance:	and since you can buffer hydra at any point during your e, you get that much more dmg instantly
cadance:	also if you activate hydra and press q, they both go off at the same time
cadance:	you can do e > q > e under tower and that gives you massive damage and lets you get out before the tower can target you
cadance:	that's not even all of them
cadance:	it's stupid
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
cadance:	hydra cancels your e animation and lets you get the w off, q cancels your w animation and lets you get the second e off
cadance:	e > hydra > w > q > e
cadance:	you do do a full combo in less than a second
cadance:	he's so much smoother
cadance:	god i love this new renekton
cadance:	i would watch kripp but he's playing shadowverse
cadance:	pretty much
willofd2011:	lol
Luckyskarm:	So, your just waiting to play League?

SuperGummying:	That didn't work

superheronerd:	I don't like that it doesn't strike through the middle
Luckyskarm:	But can you color text?
cadance:	struck through, underlined, bolded, italicized all at once
Luckyskarm:	~~you mean this?~~

cadance:	you can also strike it through? word
cadance:	when you REALLY want to get your point across
cadance:	underline bold italic interesting
cadance:	__***test***__
willofd2011:	Lol
cadance:	literally just wayne gretski and terms i got from watching the mighty ducks
cadance:	yep that's pretty much my knowledge of hocky
cadance:	and wayne gretski passes the puck to wayne gretski.... he'll have to get past wayne gretski if he wants a chance at the goal..... GRETSKI DODGES, HE DEAKS, IT'S JUST GRETSKI STANDING IN GRETSKI'S WAY.... AND GRETSKI SCOOOOOOORES, GRETSKI'S TEAM LEADS 1-0
SuperGummying:	I'll be laughing hard

KingofZeal:	HE SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES
willofd2011:	An irl stream lol
SuperGummying:	When they score just yell loud
KingofZeal:	lol
SuperGummying:	That would be interesting
SuperGummying:	Well Eyan you could make a new twitch channel and stream that while commentating the game
KingofZeal:	Next game is Saturday according to what I read but I haven't seen confirmation on the time
KingofZeal:	I may
willofd2011:	Stream right after the game? Or would that be too late?
KingofZeal:	Trust me, I've tried
cadance:	stream game online? hello? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Also, hockey is way too fast paced to watch while doing something else
KingofZeal:	Don't have a TV in my room
willofd2011:	Lol
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	*and chat goes silent as they contemplate cadance's brilliant idea, wondering why they didn't think of it themselves*
cadance:	play hearthstone while watching game
willofd2011:	^^
superheronerd:	^
KingofZeal:	Pretty sure that'd get me banned
SuperGummying:	On twitch
SuperGummying:	Stream the game
SuperGummying:	Why don't you do both Eyan?
KingofZeal:	The only bad thing is, now I'll probably not stream more nights so I can watch the Penguins, lol
willofd2011:	That's good and my day was good thank you ^w^
KingofZeal:	And TSM didn't go 0-2
KingofZeal:	The Penguins won
superheronerd:	Pretty swell.
KingofZeal:	Excellent
SuperGummying:	Good you?
willofd2011:	So how was everyone's day ^w^

KingofZeal:	Bamboozled by my own bot
SuperGummying:	....so um is the answer a no?
willofd2011:	I guess so lol
KingofZeal:	*Allergies are God's way of nerfing people just to shuckle with them
superheronerd:	that was amazing
willofd2011:	XD
KingofZeal:	Oh screw you
willofd2011:	Lol

cadance:	i'm gonna kill myself
SuperGummying:	Lol
KingofZeal:	*Cough cough*
SuperGummying:	Probably
Aqua033:	It's Cadance, do you think he'd have a girlfriend? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Man, do I feel a draft
KingofZeal:	*Cough*
SuperGummying:	Gf or just friend?
cadance:	used to be almost every day
Aqua033:	I'd do that
cadance:	gummy i drive 30 miles just to hang out with a girl i know
willofd2011:	It feels like I would run over everything when i start driving lol
Aqua033:	My mom is almost always pissed off at the drivers here
SuperGummying:	That's 6 miles
SuperGummying:	I drive 10 kilo in town
cadance:	i like the drivers in kansas
KingofZeal:	All drivers suck, except me, I'm exceptional
SuperGummying:	I'm a good driver though
KingofZeal:	There isn't

KingofZeal:	That's a new one
willofd2011:	Lol XD
superheronerd:	Is there a city that actually had good drivers?
KingofZeal:	Cadance actually obeying the rules
Aqua033:	You haven't been to New Jersey, Cadance
KingofZeal:	Wow
cadance:	worst drivers ever, horrible traffic, shitty political situation that i won't get into because eyan said no politics discussion
KingofZeal:	10/10
SuperGummying:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Because Candace is there
superheronerd:	Why do you despise Denver?
SuperGummying:	We are heading to Colorado
SuperGummying:	Alright Bella call off the Texas and New York invasion
cadance:	i despise denver
cadance:	it's.... interesting
superheronerd:	I think it's super cool
superheronerd:	I've been to Colorado once
cadance:	i've said colorado like 20 times
Aqua033:	I wish microwaves were quieter
SuperGummying:	Now cadance where do you live so I can invade your state?
SuperGummying:	Marshal actually

SuperGummying:	You don't call my province you stupid
SuperGummying:	........
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>

Demon Lord 93:	I'm in canada but I live really close to the border
cadance:	pretty much if it's west of the Mississippi River i've been there
cadance:	i've been to so many places in the US

Demon Lord 93:	I went there last fall for the first time in years

Demon Lord 93:	has anyone here ever been to Minnesota?

SuperGummying:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	That's pretty ironic, I too live near an oakdale
cadance:	gummy i used to be able to see vancouver island from my house does that count?
superheronerd:	He goes to Merced now though. Don't know how far out that is
SuperGummying:	You guys really need to visit Canada
willofd2011:	Yeah lol
cadance:	ah that's right next to oakdale
superheronerd:	Oh really?
cadance:	modesto?
willofd2011:	Funny enough Bella got it lol
superheronerd:	An old friend of mine lives up in Modesto
cadance:	are you in oakdale?
cadance:	right outside of fresno
cadance:	and that's in madera
cadance:	i could have sworn i drove through san fran on my way to my step dad's family's house
willofd2011:	Lol yeah
KingofZeal:	I'm not half bad at world geography, but take that to a local level and I can't find my way to anywhere outside a 10 mile radius, lol
cadance:	oh wait fresno is more south than i thought
willofd2011:	It really doesn't help that I'm bad at directions too lol
superheronerd:	Because it's extremely different to me
SuperGummying:	In no street lights
SuperGummying:	You seem interested
SuperGummying:	Oh come on
superheronerd:	10 minutes tops
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	Bella how much do you wanna bet that you will be able to survive in my town?
KingofZeal:	I like my nice cozy suburbs, and then of course I can taste the city with the cozyness of Pittsburgh
Aqua033:	brb
SuperGummying:	Okay i just notice I have so many Russian places I want to go to
superheronerd:	I went to the Midwest last year and I could not get into it
cadance:	you aren't making this easy will
superheronerd:	But city is what I prefer to live in
KingofZeal:	Ah
superheronerd:	I'm saying I would be okay with the country
willofd2011:	Actually a bit more south from Sacramento lol
KingofZeal:	Wouldn't outdoorsy make you more country?  lol
superheronerd:	Given I'm pretty outdoorsy, i just love the city
KingofZeal:	The Pittsburgh suburbs are just right for ol' Eyan
SuperGummying:	1. LA (so many things I wanna do there)                             2. Paris (already been to but I wanna see Napoleon's tomb)                                                                                          3. Moscow (reasons)                                                              4. Saint Petersburg (reasons)                                                5. Volgograd (reasons)                                                         6. Kaliningrad (reasons)
superheronerd:	I thrive on city life
KingofZeal:	Especially that big of one
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I'm not much of a city person
Aqua033:	Still, it leaves me as a sorta socially awkward mess around anyone and everyone I don't know well
willofd2011:	Well not close to Sacramento but it's around that direction I think lol
superheronerd:	It's not for everyone, for sure
KingofZeal:	I've actually been there but I was too young to really remember it well
KingofZeal:	Based on what my aunt said about LA, I don't think I'd like to live in a place like that
superheronerd:	Everything is really conveniently nearby
cadance:	wow i am so sorry for you will
superheronerd:	I consider the Los Angeles area to be lucky as well.
Aqua033:	It kinda is, yeah
KingofZeal:	That sounds like a personal problem Aqua, lol
willofd2011:	Close lol
Aqua033:	People here are assholes to anyone who isn't a ~~filthy normie~~ part of any sport
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **cadance leveled up!**
cadance:	are you in sacramento will?
KingofZeal:	I consider myself very lucky to be where I'm at geographically
KingofZeal:	I love PIttsburgh
willofd2011:	Tho San Francisco is not that far either lol
Aqua033:	That's mainly because of the people, though
Aqua033:	Philadelphia's been pretty shit to me
willofd2011:	Eh slightly closer to Fresno i think lol
Zek:	terrible city
Zek:	No just Pittsburgh
Aqua033:	Pennsylvania sucks, can confirm
cadance:	1. Japan (everywhere, because you can do that in japan)
2. Australia (sydney, specifically the Blue Mountains)
3. Scotland (Glasgow predominately, but also Edinburgh)
SuperGummying:	Series
Zek:	as well as Pennsylvania
SuperGummying:	League of legends championship
superheronerd:	I have no idea what LCS is
Zek:	California is a terrible state
KingofZeal:	Plus you're in LCS driving distance range, lol
Aqua033:	She's offline
Aqua033:	Ah, nevermind
KingofZeal:	I asked cause I have an aunt who lives in LA
Aqua033:	brb
Aqua033:	I need to ask my friend about moving to my place
SuperGummying:	I wanna see Kaliningrad
Aqua033:	Oh shit, that's right
cadance:	my top places to visit
superheronerd:	And New Zealand
superheronerd:	I really would love to see Australia
SuperGummying:	And you seen the size of it
Aqua033:	The places I want to go when I graduate are: Some random ass place in GB, to take my friend there to see a friend of theirs, Sydney, Austrailia, because a friend lives there, and somewhere in Canada because idk
SuperGummying:	Hey I got lost in my town before
SuperGummying:	Yup
SuperGummying:	Lol
superheronerd:	And you choose the biggest city in the area?
SuperGummying:	You know I can get lost very easily right?
superheronerd:	Trust me, it's very easy to find.
SuperGummying:	Bella wanna be my tour guide? Since I have no clue where Hollywood is
cadance:	too many homeless
cadance:	i didn't like LA or San Francisco when i was there
superheronerd:	I go to LA every Friday though
SuperGummying:	I got a list of what I want to do there
SuperGummying:	LA is the number one place I wanna go
cadance:	NorCal is cool, the napa valley is amazing if you like wine
superheronerd:	More like a suburb of LA
cadance:	LA is still southern california lol
KingofZeal:	Do you live in LA?
superheronerd:	I'd love to see Northern California
Aqua033:	What I'm probably gonna do after I graduate is travel a lot
cadance:	i'd move to glasgow instead
willofd2011:	*goes to look at a map*
SuperGummying:	I'm moving to Scotland
cadance:	uh gummy it's edinburgh but why?
cadance:	san fran? or more north, like fresno?
SuperGummying:	What's the capital of Scotland?
willofd2011:	I live in the central valley lol
superheronerd:	Driving upstate takes _ages_
Aqua033:	I've considered moving to Washington once I get out of high school
cadance:	all have different types of people
cadance:	all 3 states
cadance:	yeah, southern california, northern california, and the central valley
willofd2011:	Lol I guess so XD

Aqua033:	I think...Spokane or something like that?
Aqua033:	Not there
cadance:	i used to live in Oak Harbor
Aqua033:	Uhh
cadance:	where near seattle?
willofd2011:	I've never been to the east coast so i really don't have an opinion lol
Aqua033:	On one hand, I was born near Seattle in Washington state, and most of my family lives there. 
On the other hand, everything online I've done up to this point is due to my location on the east coast.
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	eh
cadance:	so it doesn't count
cadance:	any water near them is icy
cadance:	canada has no coasts
SuperGummying:	That's all you need to know
superheronerd:	It's more of a younger person thing at least
SuperGummying:	I live in Canada
superheronerd:	Weirdly people don't usually say it ironically here
Aqua033:	I don't really have much of a preference tbh
cadance:	west coast still best coast
cadance:	i live in colorado
KingofZeal:	Either that, or they're trying to justify where they live, lol
KingofZeal:	Any time I hear somebody say west coast best coast, it feels like they don't mean it
SuperGummying:	Alright guys I'm catching up to master
Aqua033:	I'm not gonna deny that
superheronerd:	West coast best coast
Aqua033:	tbh though
With all the trouble my area has caused me, it was worth
cadance:	west coast best coast
willofd2011:	Lol
superheronerd:	west coast problems..
cadance:	<:kffcRage:283764909387415553> <:kffcRage:283764909387415553> <:kffcRage:283764909387415553> <:kffcRage:283764909387415553> <:kffcRage:283764909387415553> <:kffcRage:283764909387415553>

Aqua033:	My birthday is in July
SuperGummying:	My bday is in a month
KingofZeal:	ooh, probably will be then
willofd2011:	It's next Thursday eyan lol
Aqua033:	Not to make others feel bad, it's just fun
SuperGummying:	My mood is weird
Aqua033:	I tend to be depressing when I'm in a particularly good mood, ironically
KingofZeal:	No idea when your birthday is, but hopefully I'm streaming that day
SuperGummying:	Bella who's side are you on?
superheronerd:	I don't either, for mine.
willofd2011:	*has no idea what she's doing on her birthday*
superheronerd:	You're not gonna win this one, <@199725993416589313>
SuperGummying:	.....
Aqua033:	I can be as negative as I want :3
SuperGummying:	Aqua don't be negative
superheronerd:	Oooh next Thursday?
Aqua033:	I don't like me either
SuperGummying:	Aqua I don't like you <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
willofd2011:	I just realized that I'm turning 24 next Thursday fun lol
SuperGummying:	I mean they went 1-1
Aqua033:	Nah, I was just laughing to make you feel better <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	Okay people do think it's funny
willofd2011:	Lol
Aqua033:	Ha
SuperGummying:	Okay you have to admit that was funny
SuperGummying:	Lul
SuperGummying:	Biggest mistake today was expecting tsm to go 2-0
Aqua033:	I've screwed up a ton
KingofZeal:	Well, the good news is, we can all happily accept we've all screwed up somewhere before.  lol
willofd2011:	Lol yeah I have been for the past 2 almost 3 years lol XD
SuperGummying:	But ida isn't here
SuperGummying:	I was about to make another joke
SuperGummying:	Same
superheronerd:	I have too
KingofZeal:	I've made more mistakes than I care to admit
SuperGummying:	Will I forgot you were legal age
SuperGummying:	And I still haven't learnt my lesson on them
SuperGummying:	But I made the most mistakes on YouTube
SuperGummying:	But I don't take in everything
KingofZeal:	I knew a particular person who never bothered learning from their mistakes and just bitched about them
SuperGummying:	I try to learn
KingofZeal:	Learning from your mistakes is the important part
willofd2011:	I just don't drink at all lol
SuperGummying:	Or freedom!
SuperGummying:	I still haven't learn my lesson about the whole sub bot thing
SuperGummying:	I love how ironic that was to me
SuperGummying:	Than yeah....
SuperGummying:	Though if you aren't going to learn from it
SuperGummying:	Yup it is
KingofZeal:	Sometimes making mistakes is a good thing
SuperGummying:	Though I did stop in the middle of the road to play Pokemon go
KingofZeal:	I've actually learned some good lessons from it though
SuperGummying:	Yeah I don't do it anymore
KingofZeal:	Don't get me wrong, drinking can be a lot of fun, but it's very important to do it responsibly
superheronerd:	Still dont do it though.
superheronerd:	Different reasons.
SuperGummying:	And I only did it a few times
SuperGummying:	Don't worry you already lecture me enough on texting and driving
superheronerd:	I'd rather not start a drinking and driving talk.
superheronerd:	0/10 is pretty accurate
SuperGummying:	I mean my friend rolled the vehicle when he was drinking and driving
superheronerd:	I've seen my fair share
superheronerd:	Drinking incidents are always very...touchy.
KingofZeal:	That second drinking incident was fun, luckily Lightning was actually there for me.  She had the pleasure of listening to my horid mental breakdown.  Not fun v_v 0/10
SuperGummying:	It 19 where I live
SuperGummying:	And the legal age there is 18
SuperGummying:	I'm like no where near that
SuperGummying:	Montreal....
superheronerd:	Wherever Montreal is I think
superheronerd:	I have a couple friends that live out there though
superheronerd:	Yeaaah I'm good, thank you haha
SuperGummying:	So just hope over and start drinking lol
SuperGummying:	I mean you are almost legal here Bella
superheronerd:	I know pretty much nothing about it
superheronerd:	Weirdly, I'm not far off from it being legal
SuperGummying:	Yeah that's a bad habit if you drink when upset
KingofZeal:	I told myself I wouldn't drink when upset after the first incident
KingofZeal:	But one of them kind of was a result of shitty things happening after I started drinking
KingofZeal:	There's been two instances I overdrank though
SuperGummying:	Awwww
KingofZeal:	Nah
SuperGummying:	Get drunk tonight Eyan
KingofZeal:	I keep my drinking pretty controlled, at best once a week, except maybe around Christmas, and usually only a few drinks anyways.  Then I'll get super drunk once every few months for the lulz
SuperGummying:	From drinking and driving
SuperGummying:	Doesn't stop my friends
superheronerd:	You avoid alcohol bc it's _illegal_
SuperGummying:	Things I saw
SuperGummying:	I avoid alcohol because of horrors
SuperGummying:	It's not that bad
KingofZeal:	And even then, that could be far worse
KingofZeal:	The only actual bad habit I have is drinking
SuperGummying:	Even a little kid like me
KingofZeal:	Every adult I know tells me it's a good choice
KingofZeal:	I know I have.  😛
SuperGummying:	I think I may be addicted
SuperGummying:	Tbh Eyan you made a right choice not drinking coffee
KingofZeal:	I still shudder at the thought that I had braces for 5 years.  😭
KingofZeal:	My thought process with coffee is, I'm already tired as hell when I wake up, coffee would help me not be tired until my body got used to it.  Then I'd have to drink something to still be tired in the end anyways and my already not so great teeth would be worse for wear
KingofZeal:	See ya Ida
SuperGummying:	You know I want a coffee now
superheronerd:	See you
SuperGummying:	Have fun ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	Off to work >.<
superheronerd:	I don't see coffee like. Making a difference when people drink it
SuperGummying:	Does 5 cups in an hour look like I'm addicted?
SuperGummying:	I'm not addicted
KingofZeal:	No, smelling coffee does not count, lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy's definitely addicted to coffee
KingofZeal:	Yeah, but most coffee drinkers more or less become addicted to it
Neon Strike Kitty:	does that count?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've smelled coffee
SuperGummying:	Coffee is only a habit if you are addicted
KingofZeal:	I always am happy to find fellow non-coffee drinkers.  It seems like it's weird these days to not drink coffee
superheronerd:	The closest I get to coffee is coffee ice cream..
KingofZeal:	Coffee is a habit I'm so glad I've avoided
Neon Strike Kitty:	https://giphy.com/gifs/coffee-futurama-fry-zWwngnPi6vWfe
SuperGummying:	Surprised I haven't had a caffeine overdose yet
SuperGummying:	Record is 4-5 cups in one hour
Neon Strike Kitty:	Nope
SuperGummying:	COFFEE!
SuperGummying:	You guys wanna know a good drink?
superheronerd:	I like a really good sprite that gives a burn when you drink it
superheronerd:	Root beer is a worthy favorite soda/drink.
Neon Strike Kitty:	(I personally despise Mountain Dew because it's just water that hurts my tongue)
KingofZeal:	Maybe I should rebrand my favorite drink to root beer
Neon Strike Kitty:	Probably not
SuperGummying:	Is it moonshine?
KingofZeal:	I too love root beer.  I usually say Mountain Dew is my favorite, but I could always be in the mood for roo beer
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's a national thing, might not exist outside the country
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know what it's called in English
SuperGummying:	Now what's that one soda?
Neon Strike Kitty:	and am just gonna pop it up at random from time to time
SuperGummying:	This is torture
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got this saved
willofd2011:	O.o
SuperGummying:	Let's be civil
SuperGummying:	Whoa whoa ida
superheronerd:	I envy you then. It took me forever to break out of a bad soda habit
Neon Strike Kitty:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	Alright
SuperGummying:	Wait nvm
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't actually know if it's a soda
SuperGummying:	Ida we can't be friends
Neon Strike Kitty:	except that one soda
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't even like sodas
superheronerd:	People are really 50/50 on it
superheronerd:	So good.
superheronerd:	Root beer is one of my top drinks
SuperGummying:	Ida you do know it's soda right...
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not even gonna try it solo
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's got the word beer in it
SuperGummying:	Because I decided it was a good idea
superheronerd:	They're meant separate
willofd2011:	Lol
superheronerd:	Why would you
SuperGummying:	It tastes funny afterwards
SuperGummying:	Don't mix root beer with water
SuperGummying:	Okay um
SuperGummying:	Love this banter talk we have going on
SuperGummying:	Lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Alright
SuperGummying:	I got allies
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lost this one how?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd like to be part of that but the timing would most likely be invoncenient >.>
SuperGummying:	You lost this one
SuperGummying:	Oh yes ida
SuperGummying:	Now where was I?
SuperGummying:	Have fun lol
SuperGummying:	Kk
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I'm going back to not paying attention to this conversation.  Maybe I'll do a multiplayer civ game on stream some day in the near future
SuperGummying:	Chips
MajesticEclipse02:	Pringles
SuperGummying:	That's 3/2 vs 3
KingofZeal:	Granted in multiplayer, I can be a bit cut throat, but that's cause I'm jaded from being burned so many times
SuperGummying:	So if Eyan joins my side
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're invited again
SuperGummying:	Eyan I'll do give you civ money
KingofZeal:	I'm actually a pretty passive player in Civ
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, with that attitude you're not gonna play with us 😛
KingofZeal:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	but Civ has more than one way to win
KingofZeal:	2, I don't need somebody to give me land, especially when I can just take it
SuperGummying:	Civ 5
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, it's probably time for me to tell you this
KingofZeal:	1, don't know what we're talking about
Neon Strike Kitty:	but we would all get wrecked
SuperGummying:	If you help me beat ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	it could be fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm actually wondering if we should invite him to play with us
SuperGummying:	And two Eyan I will give you land
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **superheronerd leveled up!**
superheronerd:	Timely interruption
SuperGummying:	Okay one I did not expect that
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
KingofZeal:	Why am I helping you?
SuperGummying:	If we both fail I still have Eyan to help me
SuperGummying:	Don't worry I got something up my sleeve
Neon Strike Kitty:	LOL
SuperGummying:	I know how to keep my money
SuperGummying:	How?
Neon Strike Kitty:	and his people will rebel
Neon Strike Kitty:	He's gonna go bankrupt
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know if that would be a good idea
SuperGummying:	Just in case master or Dragonite attack
SuperGummying:	You can be my ally
SuperGummying:	Also if you play with us
superheronerd:	Riiiiiiiight
SuperGummying:	It's working
SuperGummying:	So I'm trying to lower her morale
SuperGummying:	Ida thinks she can beat me in civ
SuperGummying:	Bella it's easy
cadance:	you need a map
superheronerd:	K now I'm the one who is lost
Neon Strike Kitty:	We'll see
Neon Strike Kitty:	Alright
SuperGummying:	You can't do anything
SuperGummying:	As long as I have buffer zones and an ocean beside me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Again, I sincerely doubt that
SuperGummying:	Those will be used to beat you
SuperGummying:	Don't forget civ tactics
Neon Strike Kitty:	I sincerely doubt that
SuperGummying:	Plus
SuperGummying:	That counts a lot
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know how much that counts for
SuperGummying:	You never watch me play napoleon Total War have you?
Neon Strike Kitty:	but I've never actually seen those so-called "amazing tactics"
Neon Strike Kitty:	You talk about them everyday
SuperGummying:	I talked about them everyday
SuperGummying:	Yeah you do
Neon Strike Kitty:	I do?
SuperGummying:	Don't lie
SuperGummying:	Ida you know they are amazing
SuperGummying:	Good
Neon Strike Kitty:	No, there's no real world countries.
Neon Strike Kitty:	What's so amazing about them?
SuperGummying:	Wait are the Russian and Sweden army in this game?
SuperGummying:	I need to show my amazing tactics and strategies
SuperGummying:	Still I want to play it again because its war
LuckyTumminello:	oh ok a streamer I watch on youtube did a playthrough on it that games reminds me a lot of a game I was obssesed with as a kid called shining force
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't recommend it
SuperGummying:	Like I said the intro song scared me because it was in Russian
Neon Strike Kitty:	Fire Emblem
superheronerd:	You didn't even finish the prologue
LuckyTumminello:	I don't even know what game your talking about
SuperGummying:	I played through the first chapter
SuperGummying:	Not for me
superheronerd:	And amazing
superheronerd:	Bc it is addictive.
superheronerd:	Don't worry lucky, it takes up far too much time to play
LuckyTumminello:	lol
LuckyTumminello:	Gummy has a point
SuperGummying:	Only you react differently
SuperGummying:	I can tease you
SuperGummying:	Hey if you can tease me
Neon Strike Kitty:	*stifles a laugh*
SuperGummying:	Right right?
SuperGummying:	And ida and me always get along
SuperGummying:	.....yup
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's best that way
LuckyTumminello:	I have a feeling this will make ida and gummy get along because they will both attack me: I have no idea what game your talking about 😃
SuperGummying:	Nope he's not touching me
SuperGummying:	*hides behind Bella*
Neon Strike Kitty:	May Seth have mercy on your soul
Neon Strike Kitty:	*throws Seth at Gummy*

SuperGummying:	*starts running*
SuperGummying:	why did i say bleh in front of ida?
SuperGummying:	camilla
SuperGummying:	bleh

Dragonite:	no i'm dragonite
SuperGummying:	dragonite you are wrong
Dragonite:	wrong
SuperGummying:	no thats a lie
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're always trying to go into ego mode
SuperGummying:	even though it appears like you arrive when i try to go into ego mode even though ida and dragonite figured me out at this point
SuperGummying:	oh good
superheronerd:	I get distracted from discord really easily so I'm not sure
SuperGummying:	right away
SuperGummying:	yes ma'am
Neon Strike Kitty:	IT'S NOT DIFFICULT
Neon Strike Kitty:	LEARN THIS
Neon Strike Kitty:	*would have

SuperGummying:	ida if you could turn off my ego
Neon Strike Kitty:	*turns off Gummy's ego*

SuperGummying:	even though it ended up with me ban
Dragonite:	wrong
SuperGummying:	yes it was smart
Dragonite:	and no
Dragonite:	i want to do that again
Dragonite:	man, it's been a long time time since i taped my 3DS to the wall
SuperGummying:	was it ever smart for me to get a 3ds capture card?
SuperGummying:	dragonite
cadance:	just do what eyan did and tape your DS to the wall then put a camcorder in front of it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Dragonite:	_emulates Sch - wait a minute . ._
SuperGummying:	kk
Neon Strike Kitty:	but seriously gtg
Dragonite:	it's a pain in the neck
Neon Strike Kitty:	I emulate
Dragonite:	you need an extra wire to record sound though
SuperGummying:	i think you can still get those
SuperGummying:	ds capture card
SuperGummying:	true
Dragonite:	also a 3DS capture card will do you no good for a GBA game
Dragonite:	_looks at OBS_
SuperGummying:	get a 3ds capture card if you wanna record
Neon Strike Kitty:	anyways I'm late, I'm late
Neon Strike Kitty:	If I had a recording software I'd do a playthrough of SS- Seth only
SuperGummying:	stupid region lock
SuperGummying:	darn
SuperGummying:	unless i cheat
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd say we should do a vs in our castles but Fates is region restricted
Neon Strike Kitty:	Most likely
SuperGummying:	i think you can beat me in fire emblem than
Neon Strike Kitty:	[–]PugiPugiPugi43 5 points 4 months ago 
Whether he's a paladin or in my randomized run a fucking gorgon, Seth is a god, his states are broken on their own, but then he has those fucking growth rates. I've soloed the game with Seth, and if it weren't for the fact that your lord is nesseccary to deploy, he'd be fucking invincible. He's 99% invincible, so close enough.
SuperGummying:	was i lied to?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not against Seth
SuperGummying:	.....but i thought camilla can fight?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Seth proceeds to 1-shot Camilla*
SuperGummying:	camilla!
SuperGummying:	besides i got something up my sleeve
Dragonite:	okay usopp
SuperGummying:	with me giving orders
SuperGummying:	he can't solo my army
Neon Strike Kitty:	and that's not even difficult
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seth can actually solo the entire game he's in
Kireina:	lol
Dragonite:	actually let's start with the basics, who wants to give gummy a primer in 'role play?"
Dragonite:	who wants to give gummy a primer in "role play vs reality?"
SuperGummying:	can't win
SuperGummying:	no he can'
Neon Strike Kitty:	*watches your army get slaughtered*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*positions Seth in the middle of the map*
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	we are invading
SuperGummying:	here is my army
Neon Strike Kitty:	You look very four-legged
Neon Strike Kitty:	*rings a Bullskitty alarm*
SuperGummying:	thats me pointing
SuperGummying:	see
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	i even have a picture
SuperGummying:	i gave orders
Dragonite:	_'s bullskitty alarm starts making loud noises again_
SuperGummying:	and rode a horse into battle
SuperGummying:	yes i have
Neon Strike Kitty:	https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/8/8e/Seth.png/revision/latest?cb=20160930095912
Neon Strike Kitty:	Have you ever actually held either of those?
Dragonite:	_stabs Gummy repeatedly with a bayonet_
SuperGummying:	and bayonet
SuperGummying:	with a musket
SuperGummying:	yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	But can you fight?
SuperGummying:	im a master tactician and strategist
SuperGummying:	the dude is like me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not as powerful as Seth, though
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ephraim's a master tactician and a skilled spearman
SuperGummying:	you said you would watch it
Dragonite:	good for you
SuperGummying:	one piece dubs are out
Dragonite:	now what
SuperGummying:	dragonite
SuperGummying:	he cxan't take over my place
SuperGummying:	he got lucky
Neon Strike Kitty:	He says that right before taking over a fortress deep inside enemy territory with only three soldiers
SuperGummying:	don't pick a fight with me than
Neon Strike Kitty:	“Trust me. I don't pick fights I can't win.”
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ephraim
SuperGummying:	whos that?
Neon Strike Kitty:	
SuperGummying:	and elise
SuperGummying:	^^
Neon Strike Kitty:	great, now the wall's red
Pogi:	Two of them
Pogi:	She has an amazing personality
Pogi:	Don't hate on my girl Camilla
Neon Strike Kitty:	Your opinion is awful
superheronerd:	Don't even get me started on Roy, Ike, and Marth
SuperGummying:	ida i have my opinion
superheronerd:	Chrom and Lucina are where it's at
Neon Strike Kitty:	I should stop hitting my face against the wall
Neon Strike Kitty:	My forehead is bleeding
SuperGummying:	she looks nice though
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's almost on the level of your favorite FE character being Camilla
SuperGummying:	dragonite turn around
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ
SuperGummying:	hey it's better than the sub bot things
Neon Strike Kitty:	*sighs for way too long*
SuperGummying:	i blame dragonite
SuperGummying:	can't believe he was runner up
SuperGummying:	it was so painful at the end though
Aqua033:	I never liked it

Neon Strike Kitty:	*Why do you care about the Pokemon anime?*
SuperGummying:	i can't believe he lost 😭
Dragonite:	most of them have one of those ports that you can plug a screen into
Dragonite:	i mean, you can have a second monitor on a laptop, too
SuperGummying:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgN-umPPhY
SuperGummying:	this is what i saw
Neon Strike Kitty:	*is on a laptop*
SuperGummying:	i saw something i shouldn't have seen
SuperGummying:	im about to cry

Dragonite:	i have discord and IRC up on my second monitor, plus my youtube Watch Later on my phone
superheronerd:	My first goal is to not have a straight up potato for a computer
superheronerd:	Nope
SuperGummying:	i did tell you that before right?
SuperGummying:	you know my other uses with a second monitor
SuperGummying:	bella
superheronerd:	Of all the cool things a second monitor could bring..
SuperGummying:	im starting to tweet more instead of letting youtube do it for me
SuperGummying:	thats how i get the news
SuperGummying:	dragonite i always had twitter up on my second monitor
Dragonite:	why would you do that to yourself
SuperGummying:	thats why you use a phone or have a second monitor with twitter being up all the time
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've not managed to get checking twitter back into my habit since then
SuperGummying:	yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Remember that I went on a trip a few days ago?
SuperGummying:	why
Neon Strike Kitty:	I stopped using my twitter
SuperGummying:	i found master's first tweet yay
SuperGummying:	^
Luckyskarm:	Sleep is 4 the weak
Master9000:	And hopefully I can now finally sleep
Master9000:	We are now rgb
SuperGummying:	thanks
Luckyskarm:	Grats on your new role Gummy
SuperGummying:	yay i finally found my first tweet
Master9000:	Mute being with mee6
Master9000:	If you mute then unmutr someone you have to delete their specialized permission before banishing them will prevent talking
SuperGummying:	i don't even rememebr what we were talking about before
Master9000:	Oh yeah there's a slight pesky feature I just realized
SuperGummying:	that was a fun sports talk
Pogi:	ding ding ding
Master9000:	I was expecting `/tts ding ding ding ding` etc...
Dragonite:	uhh
KingofZeal:	I did it
KingofZeal:	ding
Master9000:	Don't do it Eyan
Aqua033:	I didn't do tts
Aqua033:	We don't
Master9000:	I don't think we have tts in this channel lol
Aqua033:	*Ding*
Master9000:	So many dings
Pogi:	The Preds have a history of losing to the Sharks and Red Wings every year. Can't lose to them if they are already out.
Zek:	May be wrong
Zek:	Except it's actually quite even between the two I think
Zek:	Kind of like how the Bruins have a history of losing to the Canadians :(((((
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seriously though, sports talk is just an alien language to me
KingofZeal:	I think it's a 9-1 record now or something in the playoffs
KingofZeal:	Yup
Pogi:	The Caps have a glorious history of losing to the Penguins and the Islanders
KingofZeal:	Or loss from the perspective of the Caps
Zek:	😦
Pogi:	So what I got from that video
Zek:	And I'm also pissed because this is probably their last or second to last year before they become mediocre again
KingofZeal:	And then just tack on one more win at the end of that video
Master9000:	Thx
KingofZeal:	I linked a video just a little ways up, that explains all you need to know
SuperGummying:	go to sleep master
KingofZeal:	And it's pretty troll cause of the history between the two teams
Master9000:	Cuck C~~r~~osby???
KingofZeal:	The Penguins won realmaster, which is my team
Zek:	And it's funny af
Kireina:	zek
Kireina:	Hockey
Zek:	Everyone is chanting cuck Crosby
Kireina:	Capitals
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know
Master9000:	What's all this sports talk?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Master, go to sleep
Master9000:	I forgot to turn on do not disturb on my phone and finally reached over to get it after enough notifs lol
Kireina:	like god damn
Kireina:	Cap fans ptsd when the hear Penguins,Islanders, and Rangers. Which is justified since those teams have owned them like slaves.
Zek:	This metro car is lit though
KingofZeal:	LUL
Zek:	LUL
Zek:	Oh wait
Zek:	Thank god I have my side hoes in the form of the Bruins
KingofZeal:	lol
Zek:	<@!304073163669766158> that video made me want to end my life
Kireina:	JESUS
Kireina:	LMFAO
Kireina:	That video
Pogi:	Eh, true
KingofZeal:	I'm 95% sure the Penguins only won that series from peaking Godly goaltending
Pogi:	Dude is a monster
Pogi:	Nah, Pekka Rinne has been single handedly keeping the Preds from not sucking for years.
KingofZeal:	Cause Fluery carried the shit out of the Pens this series
KingofZeal:	Is that sarcasm?
Pogi:	Look on the bright side, at least a freaking goalkeeper isn't carrying your team
KingofZeal:	And then they got wrecked by the Penguins in round 2 of the playoffs
KingofZeal:	It's all the more hilarious is cause for the last two years, they've been a kickass team
KingofZeal:	All you need to know Ida is that being a Caps fan is suffering
SuperGummying:	ida i am french
Pogi:	unlucky
Dragonite:	_slaps mee6_
SuperGummying:	<@95708393578172416> no way we need oilers vs senators finals
Neon Strike Kitty:	This is all french to me
Pogi:	<@!304073163669766158> We still need that dank Preds vs. Penguins finals
SuperGummying:	now hopefully the oilers win as well
KingofZeal:	To forever continue the suffering of Caps fans
KingofZeal:	I don't even care, I'm just happy they beat the capitals
Dragonite:	ouch
Dragonite:	> 12 and 21
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't understand the video
SuperGummying:	yes
Pogi:	Are the Sens still in?
SuperGummying:	like i said go canada
SuperGummying:	hopefully the penguin's lose to the senators
Dragonite:	_checks the standings_
Pogi:	WANNA BET?
Dragonite:	the mets suck more
Pogi:	<@137336478291329024> The Royals suck now, it's ok
KingofZeal:	Just watch that video, and tackle another year of the capitals losing round 2 to the Penguins
Zek:	#NO RIGHTS FOR OMNICS
Dragonite:	_still upset at <@95708393578172416> for the World Series two years ago_
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't even know what's going on
KingofZeal:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmC1lNvVwlI
Zek:	KICK HIM OUT OF THE LEAGUE
KingofZeal:	You don't have to understand sports to enjoy the hilarity of this situation Ida
SuperGummying:	i hope a canadian team wins
Pogi:	:^)
Zek:	FLURRY IS NOT A HUMAN BEING
Pogi:	My Preds make it to the conference finals and you nerds are still playing
Neon Strike Kitty:	>sees sports talk
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Oh capitals capitals capitals, you still can't make it past the second round
Pogi:	Meanwhile
Zek:	What I mean t
Zek:	Uncalled penalties

Zek:	THESE REFS
KingofZeal:	It must suck to watch the Capitals go full Capitals
Kireina:	I also believe you've had this conversation many of times
Zek:	DUDE
KingofZeal:	You poor poor soul
Zek:	I live in DC
KingofZeal:	You poor soul
Zek:	Ye

Dragonite:	me made more like forty five cents
SuperGummying:	but it was for a cause
Zek:	Made a total of 2 cents
SuperGummying:	maybe my decision wasn't the best
Kireina:	Is that even possible at *whatever amount gumgum is at*
SuperGummying:	used to
Kireina:	GumGum does youtube for a job? 🤔
Neon Strike Kitty:	not because it's a job
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dragonite's doing it because he likes doingit
Kireina:	what
Kireina:	I mean
Kireina:	*stares at dragonite's lovely body*
Zek:	LIKE 20 UNCALLED PENALTIES

SuperGummying:	what are you talking about?
Kireina:	Sorry I'm too busy focused on `moved`
SuperGummying:	how come you guys never laugh at my jokes?
Neon Strike Kitty:	right
SuperGummying:	laugh
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
SuperGummying:	lol
SuperGummying:	but im worried dragonite may never move out of his parents house
SuperGummying:	yeah it was tbh
Kireina:	I mean it was pretty funny
SuperGummying:	and ida said it was jokes
SuperGummying:	see look at that
Kireina:	He can't be ***that bad*** at saving...could he?
Kireina:	LOL
Dragonite:	(◡‿   ◡✿)
Dragonite:	i'm more worried that gummy's going to waste all of his money and live in a box for the rest of his life
Kireina:	then I'm also a mystery LOL ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kireina:	I thought we were
Kireina:	oh
SuperGummying:	No
Kireina:	are we still not talking about the test?
SuperGummying:	Im not really that oblivious
Kireina:	Oh
SuperGummying:	When were you ever nervous?
Kireina:	That being said I still have confidence in you 🤔
Kireina:	perhaps nervous?
Kireina:	I wouldn't say worried
Kireina:	mmm
SuperGummying:	The only time you did worry was freedom!
SuperGummying:	From what I can tell seems like master and ida worry more than you Dragonite
SuperGummying:	No you don't Dragonite
Dragonite:	i worry about you, but probably for different reasons
SuperGummying:	Not too sure about you as well ida
SuperGummying:	Panda I'm not too sure
SuperGummying:	I know Dragonite doesn't
SuperGummying:	Yeah I can tell you actually worry
Neon Strike Kitty:	We joke because we worry
Neon Strike Kitty:	❤
SuperGummying:	You guys are nice
SuperGummying:	.....
Kireina:	xD
Neon Strike Kitty:	^
Dragonite:	: )
Dragonite:	i don't
Kireina:	but according to things you've said previously I have faith in you
Kireina:	I was mostly referring to RM because he's actually leaving
Kireina:	I mean
SuperGummying:	I didn't study
Kireina:	gl on your test
Kireina:	bai bai
SuperGummying:	Kk bye

Neon Strike Kitty:	and better greens >.>
Master9000:	To avoid flood, you can only gain xp once per minute.
Neon Strike Kitty:	and better reds
Neon Strike Kitty:	There are better blues
SuperGummying:	And I thought red was your favourite colour
SuperGummying:	Spam with me
SuperGummying:	Yeah do what I do
superheronerd:	I have a new goal.
superheronerd:	Blue is my favorite color
SuperGummying:	The blue is nice
SuperGummying:	Yay I'm blue kiddies
Master9000:	ill try to 3d print it on friday since exam tomorrow
Master9000:	yeah too many pixels in the 3d model to make the source material be effective for this
KingofZeal:	I think a realistic look and not trying to downright mimic the original is probably a good idea
Master9000:	ok im done working on this for today
Master9000:	ok hows this?
Master9000:	ok maybe it just needs to be done realistically
Master9000:	where is the middle axis tho?
Dragonite:	just copy the left (his right) and reflect it over the Y axis
Master9000:	i think i fucked it up even more now
VortexOA:	the eyes look janky now
VortexOA:	lol
Master9000:	maybe hes just made to look angry
Master9000:	when its this small of an image you cant tell taht the face is bad lol
SuperGummying:	but the sound is kinda weird
SuperGummying:	same as last year
SuperGummying:	love the NA victory theme
Deino Mite:	you aren't a complete failure
Deino Mite:	good job TSM
SuperGummying:	yay TSM
VortexOA:	lol
Master9000:	you would never see it in normals where the 0-5 top laner has double the 1-0 jungler's farm
willofd2011:	Same
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's about when I started playing
SuperGummying:	i been a fan since pre season 4
SuperGummying:	i was kidding about the whole bandwagon thing
Neon Strike Kitty:	If you vote someone because they're being voted, you're gonna get killed
Neon Strike Kitty:	Think of it like mafia
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Nobody likes a bandwagon fan Gummy
SuperGummying:	okay i like them again
SuperGummying:	hey tsm is doing better
Master9000:	lol
Master9000:	mmmmmmm
KingofZeal:	TSMMMMMMMMM
Master9000:	and heres an overlapping one
VortexOA:	so not too far off actually
VortexOA:	ah
Master9000:	look at the fingers in this
VortexOA:	oh yeah those too lol
Master9000:	yeah face and arms are the shit i cant draw
Dragonite:	the eyes are scary
VortexOA:	everything else is alright
VortexOA:	the nose and fingers are the only things that aren't very good
Dragonite:	ouch
VortexOA:	are you remaking eyans logo?
Master9000:	lmfao i tried to add a full nose
VortexOA:	what up
Rainy:	Redemption round bois
Rainy:	Hauntzer and Sven really put the "Int" in "International Stage"
SuperGummying:	Ugh c9 you should have won
Rainy:	https://twitter.com/TravisGafford/status/862421598548049920
Master9000:	i dont draw good faces lmao
Master9000:	still trying to figure out the eyes for this
Master9000:	oh god how do i do hair
SuperGummying:	Tsm is garbage
superheronerd:	It's still a twenty minute ride too, but oh well
Master9000:	damn
willofd2011:	Nice ^w^
superheronerd:	20 minutes to go, guys~
Rainy:	If GAM wins this game then at least we know TSM isn't hot garbage, just garbage.
regal swan:	thats cool
Master9000:	ok this is starting to get better
willofd2011:	Cake <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
SuperGummying:	Hmm cake
Master9000:	"to truly bake a cake from scratch, you first have to create the universe"-some science guy
SuperGummying:	Apparently I don't make original stuff
Master9000:	what about it
SuperGummying:	Remember Monday though
Master9000:	i have to come up with a new dimension for this its not just copy and paste each part
Master9000:	whats your point though?
SuperGummying:	Was it original though?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think so
Deino Mite:	did the king die before the events of the game and it made the queen go crazy?
superheronerd:	That looks pretty nice so far o:
Deino Mite:	ah
willofd2011:	That looks awesome so far lol ^w^
Master9000:	its from chrono trigger and chrono cross's fan made art of the king of zeal
Deino Mite:	where is eyan's profile picture from?
SuperGummying:	It's 1-1
Master9000:	i won 2-0
Master9000:	yes we did
SuperGummying:	We never settle the 1v1
SuperGummying:	Alright master
SuperGummying:	Nice
Master9000:	
Deino Mite:	cool!
superheronerd:	Hey nerds. I've got 50 minutes of waiting for the bus to kill
Master9000:	i can feel it
Master9000:	im getting close to overloading the program
Deino Mite:	yep
Rainy:	lol, that G2 comeback
Master9000:	i wont be able to fully display the left shoulderpad along with the III
Master9000:	it took a while to finally run into a design flaw
Master9000:	wow
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's an actual storm here
KingofZeal:	Usually the only changes involve the way extra lives and bomb fragments drop and even then, that isn't much of a change
KingofZeal:	Cause I started playing Touhou around when 12 came out
KingofZeal:	This has been true of the last 3 Touhou games
KingofZeal:	From historical observation, there has been practically no changes between the demo an actual game
Neon Strike Kitty:	and then they change the first 3 stages drastically
Deino Mite:	im looking forward to it
KingofZeal:	I'll probably play a lot of Touhou 6 too in the mean time
Master9000:	yeah im gonna be off sooner than usual because of ap final tomorrow
KingofZeal:	I'm working to master Touhou 16, my goal is to make it the first game I beat on Lunatic, lucky for me, I have 3 months to master the first 3 stages before the full game is out
Deino Mite:	yay!
Deino Mite:	so i only saw the hearthstone
KingofZeal:	With time, I'm hoping to make my streams very packed with goody gaming content
Deino Mite:	im trying to get more sleep, so im going getting off my ipad earlier at night
KingofZeal:	I plan on making Touhou a queue game
KingofZeal:	Don't worry
Deino Mite:	i missed it 😦
Neon Strike Kitty:	while in queue
Neon Strike Kitty:	He streamed it last night
Deino Mite:	eyan, are you going to be streaming touhou anytime soon or were you just talking about it cus someone asked about the game?
Deino Mite:	even though tsm were the favorite in their group for worlds and didnt make it out
Neon Strike Kitty:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	I would bet on the Koreans every tournament at this point
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm gonna have to become a pro EU player to fix that
Master9000:	just gamble on the koreans for low risk low reward
KingofZeal:	EU was legit trash
KingofZeal:	NA was actually good last year internationally
Deino Mite:	put your faith in korea
KingofZeal:	I wouldn't really put your faith in EU either
Neon Strike Kitty:	(wait, is EU out?)
Neon Strike Kitty:	Glory to EU!
KingofZeal:	Technically yes, but after that, I think it's safe to say NA is fucked
Deino Mite:	TSM, take my energy!
KingofZeal:	They play WE later
Deino Mite:	so tsm still has a chance
Deino Mite:	oh
KingofZeal:	This is a group bracket
KingofZeal:	They're best of ones
Deino Mite:	3-0?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Even I know it was a bigger slaughter than me vs the Yorick last night
KingofZeal:	They got slaughtered
Deino Mite:	how much did they lose by?
KingofZeal:	The bug might have been because I was accelerating through the replay
Deino Mite:	i get home from school to see that tsm lost to gam
KingofZeal:	The replay is super bugged though, the final score was the 32 million "high score"
Neon Strike Kitty:	I still wanna see that 100 deaths replay
Kugallyblitz:	lol and im a noob
Kugallyblitz:	looks legit to me
KingofZeal:	Frizzled hair indicates the victory, if you don't believe that, then you'll have to go to the Touhou wiki for the diologue, lol
KingofZeal:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~"It totally happened, I swear!"~~ But that replay still seems hilarious to watch
Master9000:	shouldve been streaming <:KappaPride:305603580017246209>
KingofZeal:	So it just looks like me dying a 100 times
KingofZeal:	Apparently the replay is busted and out of sync
Kugallyblitz:	touhou reminds me of geometry dash for its sheer difficulty
Master9000:	usually
Neon Strike Kitty:	Better the game than the PC
Kugallyblitz:	ey yi yi
Master9000:	woooooooooo
Neon Strike Kitty:	gj
KingofZeal:	And then the game crashed on the replay
KingofZeal:	Lol
Rainy:	RIP, but I guess you are officially not trash at TouHou, or something
Neon Strike Kitty:	You could record the replay and post it to your channel
Kugallyblitz:	yay eyan, I know this game is hard, idk how hard but yay!
Master9000:	heres my progress so far
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eyan, I actually got an idea
Neon Strike Kitty:	Congrats! Now teach me to play
KingofZeal:	Since it's not the full game
KingofZeal:	Uh, I'd have to go watch the replay cause unfortunately the demo doesn't mark it as completed
Rainy:	Pics or it didn't happen
Master9000:	screenshot?
KingofZeal:	I BEAT LUNATIC TOUHOU 16 DEMO WITHOUT USING SOME BROKEN CHEAP AYA BS
Master9000:	sup
KingofZeal:	GUYS GUYS
Master9000:	theres so many tiny detalis that feel like youre not even gonna be able to see them while at the same time if i dont add them its gonna look weird
Kireina:	How do you expect anyone to eat at those tables
Kireina:	Not even some spaces
Kireina:	🤔
Kireina:	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Kugallyblitz:	poor tables

Neon Strike Kitty:	Nah, I'm fine
Kugallyblitz:	But you have to tell me so I know! D:
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm irritated because you don't know why I'm irritated!
Neon Strike Kitty:	*throws a table at Kugal*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Just because
Kugallyblitz:	and whats tsm? lol
Kugallyblitz:	why are you guys irritable?
SuperGummying:	Tsm
Kireina:	Well you guys are mad 🤔
SuperGummying:	We are mad
Kireina:	hi kugal
SuperGummying:	Hey blitz
Kugallyblitz:	hello peoples
Kireina:	🤔
Sky:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZHSecCKpLE BRING BACK LE TOUCAN
Rainy:	WT is a fine player, but they really need LiftLifts shotcalling
Rainy:	So, any bets on the tragic accident that happens to WT so they can call in DL?
Master9000:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	your one skill
SuperGummying:	Yeah but you know how good I am with spam
Master9000:	only one per minute counts btw
SuperGummying:	Okay that's easy
SuperGummying:	Oh really?
Rainy:	lol that dredge line
Master9000:	its only 21 messages
Neon Strike Kitty:	Holy shit I'm so close to level 18
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's very close
SuperGummying:	That's not close
Master9000:	2437 / 2855 XP
Master9000:	youre pretty damn close
SuperGummying:	I'm not sure actually
SuperGummying:	I need like another level
Neon Strike Kitty:	*silently waits for the color change*
SuperGummying:	I think they did great during season 4 worlds though, remember game 3 vs ssw?
Rainy:	The memes would be 👌
Rainy:	I just wanna see GAM get 2nd vs SKT
D Shum:	lmao
D Shum:	flash wolves were so bad then
SuperGummying:	Flash wolves
D Shum:	lmao they didnt have to play a good team at iem
SuperGummying:	The only time tsm was good internationally was season 4 worlds and iem Katowice
Master9000:	eyan the king's right eye refuses to exist on the model
SuperGummying:	Even p1 meteos
KingofZeal:	TSM just doesn't have the proactivity to do well internationally right now
Rainy:	Again, FLY VS GAM would be a 50+ kill game
SuperGummying:	Both of them
Neon Strike Kitty:	Great, then I can go to sleep at 5
Master9000:	which C9 Kappa
KingofZeal:	I think C9 would have also done better
Neon Strike Kitty:	I misread the schedule, sorry
Rainy:	I ain't even mad
SuperGummying:	Don't you guys agree?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh yeah
SuperGummying:	C9 would of probably did better
D Shum:	wildturtle did greay but hes not good enough to carry that game
KingofZeal:	I got too much going on tonight to stream
SuperGummying:	Im so mad
Sky:	even when mid game gam started clowning around
KingofZeal:	If I planned on streaming, I would have already announced a change to the schedule I posted
SuperGummying:	Wildturtle did great
Sky:	they just got outmacro'd a bunch
Sky:	yeah he could have flashed that one charm but
Neon Strike Kitty:	So is there gonna be a stream today or just the hosting thing?
Sky:	i dont even think wildturtle had a bad game
Neon Strike Kitty:	*this is why I never bother with pro play*
D Shum:	most op champ in the game
D Shum:	GAM had ahri
KingofZeal:	And still blew it
D Shum:	and also
KingofZeal:	And the dumb thing is, they still could have won that
Sky:	they should just let their star player do the heavy lifting
SuperGummying:	Watch people are going to blame turtle for no reason
SuperGummying:	But than they came back
Sky:	hauntzer and sven straight up inted early game
SuperGummying:	And people called them trash
D Shum:	clg was good cause they knew how to play from behind well
KingofZeal:	But the execution was just as horrible
SuperGummying:	I mean clg did lose to a wildcard last year
KingofZeal:	The draft was horrible
D Shum:	and ur 2 worst players on carries
KingofZeal:	TSM just looked like trash
D Shum:	u have ur best playing playing lulu
KingofZeal:	CLG did well at MSI last year cause they did what worked for them
Rainy:	Their best
KingofZeal:	I really just don't get what they were doing
KingofZeal:	That just was pitiful on all fronts by TSM
KingofZeal:	I mean
Rainy:	Also I don't get why they gave Karma, *screams internally*
SuperGummying:	I'm pretty sure you are going to throw a table at me eventually
SuperGummying:	Thanks Ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	*should have
Rainy:	I believe it so hard
SuperGummying:	Should of backed when they had a chance
Rainy:	I believe it
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Sky leveled up!**
SuperGummying:	I can't believe they counter threw
Sky:	<:WutFace:305610045910024192>
Neon Strike Kitty:	Or should I say *twat*ch emote
Neon Strike Kitty:	*groans over the twitch emote*
Rainy:	kek
Rainy:	FOOOOOOOXXXXXXXX
Sky:	
Rainy:	RIIIIIIICCCKKKK
SuperGummying:	I'm an echo fox fan now
SuperGummying:	Wait no master likes c9
Master9000:	welcome to the dank side gummy
Rainy:	lul
SuperGummying:	I'm now a c9 fan
SuperGummying:	Screw this
SuperGummying:	I want c9
Master9000:	and thats why you build hurricane on twitch kids
KingofZeal:	I want CLG back
Kireina:	xd
KingofZeal:	Granted I guess it isn't a throw when you're down that much
SuperGummying:	....
Master9000:	turtle has been practicing flashing in in practice tool Kappa
KingofZeal:	And then the counter throw
Kireina:	welcome to green
Neon Strike Kitty:	Congrats on the level
Sky:	piss off meeseeks
Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	imagine if he was able to actually kill people
Sky:	im so confused
Kireina:	with the plays he making
Kireina:	WT should think about switching roles
KingofZeal:	He like, literally went behind their back line
KingofZeal:	He didn't just flash in
SuperGummying:	Turtle was great
Rainy:	TFW WT flashes in and doesn't throw XD
SuperGummying:	Told you guys
Kireina:	I believe you mean the throw deci into the dragon pit
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm laughing about it but it still hurts
Kireina:	LUL
Kireina:	Na had to withdraw from the war
Neon Strike Kitty:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't think anyone can beat my sick "throw the adc alone into the dragon pit" play
Rainy:	The team they reverse swept last week, so the precedent is 👌
Sky:	na vs vietnam 🤔
Kireina:	God Bless
Kireina:	Oh the Vietnamese team
Sky:	gigabyte marines
Kireina:	and that team is...?
Sky:	wildcard team
Kireina:	who are they playing? 🤔
Kireina:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473> when I can't watch MSI atm
Sky:	into it <:4Head:230182706187599872>
Sky:	doublelift would've flashed it <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Kireina:	lol
SuperGummying:	We need doublelift
SuperGummying:	Okay as much as I like turtle
Master9000:	or mayb u jinxed it
Rainy:	RIP
SuperGummying:	Spoke way too soon
SuperGummying:	Turtle is actually doing good
Rainy:	Probably break a record for most deaths in a pro game
Rainy:	I really wanna watch a game of FLY Vs GAM
KingofZeal:	In fact, 500 x 500 is probably much higher than I probably needed
Master9000:	the fingers look pretty shit but im gonna fillet them so its a bit more natural
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **KingofZeal leveled up!**
KingofZeal:	I doubt I made anything higher than that for an icon dude
KingofZeal:	Probably
Master9000:	eyan is 500x500 the highest res u have of the icon?
Neon Strike Kitty:	http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/632/211/aa0.png
KingofZeal:	I want literally any other NA team right now at MSI
KingofZeal:	I honestly have no clue what they're thinking
Master9000:	ive barely been watching but twitch <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Neon Strike Kitty:	"I expect nothing but am still disappointed"
KingofZeal:	Welp, I had no hope in TSM, and yet I'm still disappointed
Master9000:	its back to where u put it
Master9000:	sorry was making sure i didnt screw anything up switching between monitors
KingofZeal:	And it looks like you unmoved it but now I can't remember
KingofZeal:	I moved it
Master9000:	this reminds me of my last few games on twitch
Master9000:	eyan did u move zeal palace or did i fk something up?
Master9000:	wait
Master9000:	fuuck
Master9000:	ok that took me a while but i managed to import the image its all getting easier from here
Master9000:	im not gonna add the clock parts into it yet to reduce complexity
Master9000:	ok brb getting some paper
Master9000:	derp
Master9000:	oh this isnt a  perfect circle clock that makes things a bit harder
Master9000:	ok farthest left pixel is 65
Aqua033:	Alright, thanks
Master9000:	and i think for the last one arc length is the measure of the section out of the circumferences vs arc measure being degrees from the circle
Master9000:	second is 106pi*rr/360
Master9000:	1/3 of the circumference
Master9000:	the first one is (120/360)11pi
KingofZeal:	Forgot I had a stats class in the mix
Aqua033:	I just have a bad Geo teacher
KingofZeal:	Oh, and stats
Aqua033:	Algebra's fine for me
KingofZeal:	Minus applied math and alegebra
KingofZeal:	I haven't mathed since high school
Master9000:	yay i got the koz icon to 100px for measurements
Aqua033:	
Master9000:	lets see it
Master9000:	oh buy
Neon Strike Kitty:	*runs*
Aqua033:	The worst kind.
Aqua033:	Geometry
Master9000:	which math?
Aqua033:	Also, who here can math?
Aqua033:	Water de tilts me
Master9000:	lol that timing
Master9000:	ill try both and see what looks better
KingofZeal:	Why not try both?
KingofZeal:	I dunno, the hell if I know, lol
Master9000:	just the outline imprinted or the entire section being slightly into it?
KingofZeal:	Into the clock that is
KingofZeal:	I always envisioned it to be an imprint into the icon
Master9000:	Eyan I want to try making your profile icon 3D, would you want the king being a depression or extrusion from the clock?
KingofZeal:	Apparently Patches caught a chipmunk
Master9000:	brb making this into an expanding brain meme
Master9000:	i have discovered the enlightened calculator mode
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm hitting it sometime next week, I think
Master9000:	628 xp ETA 32 minutes if minutely messages
Dragonite:	he still talks too much, in other words
Master9000:	gummy is pretty close to becoming blue
Master9000:	on PC <:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Roserade:	SKT is love SKT is Life KappaPride
Master9000:	You mean stealing yours?
Dragonite:	he default discord table flip sucks though, i recommend finding a different one
KingofZeal:	Eh, that one's less interesting
Ayana:	​( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Master9000:	=lenny
Master9000:	There's also
KingofZeal:	I have seen the light
KingofZeal:	Ahhah
KingofZeal:	test ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	Btw there's a `/shrug` command as well
Master9000:	Wow that took a while to send
Master9000:	That or they're gonna suck up and say he was giving g2 false hope
KingofZeal:	THey really shouldn't have lost this game *shrugs*
KingofZeal:	G2-8 incoming
KingofZeal:	Yea, Faker basically got five maned and died in a brush from the most solo queue invade ever
Master9000:	r/koreanadvice is gonna have his head for that
KingofZeal:	Cause Faker tossed first blood early and G2 had a solid early game
KingofZeal:	G2 super threw
Neon Strike Kitty:	*invested 2 dollars in this*
Master9000:	I'm not home yet and my LTE is being too slow to watch league stream
KingofZeal:	THey're so bad
KingofZeal:	Perkz shockwaves are giving me cancer
Master9000:	Where is the senate these days...
Master9000:	Do it for the people paying you but only once they realize that <:KappaPride:305603580017246209>
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	The irony is, I actually just want to set up the affiliate system for my old skype group
KingofZeal:	And I will
KingofZeal:	Yes, I could
KingofZeal:	They actually easily could have beaten SKT
Master9000:	You can already have it operational for pattern since it said you get like $45 a month from there?
KingofZeal:	Which of course is also not set up, and might not be fully functional for a while
KingofZeal:	The issue with it is it's dependent on the enlightment role
willofd2011:	Good afternoon ^w^
KingofZeal:	I'd like to have a rough sketch for it before the week is out
Master9000:	And the affinity system is gonna be this week or later on probably?
KingofZeal:	That's silly nitpicking
KingofZeal:	I don't care if the edit tag is on them
Master9000:	One thing I want to point out is just re-copy pasting the rules to get rid of the *(edited)* tags on them
KingofZeal:	I was going to do some cleanup later anyways
KingofZeal:	I'll think about it
KingofZeal:	Nah, I don't want to have a seperate website for something I could just make a channel for
Master9000:	Maybe we could use your subreddit for it?
KingofZeal:	Plus I was planning to cut the creative channel until now
KingofZeal:	The ocean palace that is
KingofZeal:	But I decided to change it cause it was built to host the mammon machine
Master9000:	And mammon machine was its own thing
KingofZeal:	Ah yes, the ocean palace was the original creative channel
Master9000:	For me it's not allergies just sleep deprivation and waking up too early and then getting up and running throughout the day
KingofZeal:	But thank you regardless
KingofZeal:	Usually I'm like a zombie for the first few hours after I wake up, then the allergies kind of wear off until I wake up the next day, and the cycle repeats
KingofZeal:	It's not really a "feel better soon" so much as I just hate spring, lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh, damn. Hope you feel better soon.
Master9000:	Juxtapositionally im at one of my two mental state peaks of the day
Neon Strike Kitty:	*ART*
KingofZeal:	I'm too tired right now to think
KingofZeal:	I forget, lol
KingofZeal:	And I woke up not too long ago so my allergies are still full throttle making me miserable
Master9000:	What was it called?
KingofZeal:	I guess I could just remake the creative channel I was planning to with the intention of sharing pictures, videos, etc.
Master9000:	I've lost lane as Darius many times before Keepo
KingofZeal:	I suppose general clips could just be shared here.  I dunno, let me think on that one
Master9000:	It happens ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not my proudest games
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I am so glad that you guys don't pay much attention to the lanes I'm in >.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was catching up on last night's stream (particularly the games I was in)
Master9000:	Was just thinking more overall records if we wanted to share clips from said autohosted streams
Master9000:	Sounds good
KingofZeal:	I think it would make sense to jusdt make the Zeal Palace an all things Eyan channel
KingofZeal:	No, and I don't really wish to expand my channel list right now
Master9000:	Or a library
Master9000:	Does the palace have a vault or storage area for records of some kind?
KingofZeal:	Probably Zeal Palace in theory
Master9000:	Yeah the announcement brought it out past just your twitch clip section
KingofZeal:	Hmm, that is a good question isn't it
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> with the twitch idea in mind, where would be the best place to share clips?
KingofZeal:	Make's sense
Aqua033:	That's how
Aqua033:	You wait until a caterpiller becomes a moth
KingofZeal:	How does one wait a moth?
regal swan:	now to wait 6 moths to play hearthstone
regal swan:	doesnt work on me
Roserade:	
Kireina:	same
Dragonite:	_lies face-down on the floor_

superheronerd:	Hello 😁
Dragonite:	ahoy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Afternoon/evening
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Roserade leveled up!**
Roserade:	good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's kind of awful, I'll admit
Kireina:	That schedule sounds poop
Kireina:	🤔
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's 4:30 PM and I recently woke up
Kireina:	We're all morning people <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Dragonite:	i am not a morning person, jello
regal swan:	hey jello
JelloHammer:	Mornin people
regal swan:	well early for west coast
regal swan:	lol i didnt want to get up this early
Kireina:	xD
Dragonite:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Neon Strike Kitty:	How come for once everyone is active in my early morning when I'm working the night shift?
regal swan:	morn peeps
Luckyskarm:	*looks at chat*
Master9000:	Yeah that's what I thought I could do but by that point what is stopping you from continuing the over 24 hour daily drift?
cadance:	when Gosu plays league... cold bloods the enemy 2/1 then tries to backstab his own van cleef
willofd2011:	Lol
cadance:	debatable....
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
cadance:	going up to fort collins to feed my snake, then going to denver with dani to get my tattoos touched up a bit and then her and i are gonna just chill for a while cuz it's been forever since we did that
willofd2011:	Or morning if you want to be technical lol
willofd2011:	Okie dokie night eyan ^w^
cadance:	i won't be around much tomorrow
KingofZeal:	See ya'll
KingofZeal:	I'm gonna turn in and try to actually get good sleep so I can be awake for MSI
KingofZeal:	Anywho
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	And it did indeed go 0-3, lol
KingofZeal:	Lowest I found is 60.7
willofd2011:	*hasn't played hearthstone in ages* lol
KingofZeal:	Which might be the highest I've ever had
KingofZeal:	75 was the one I just went 12 wins with
cadance:	i think the last one i drafted, and the like third one i ever used heartharena for, i got like exactly 60
KingofZeal:	62.9 was my worst draft in 25 drafts
cadance:	you underestimate my draft luck
KingofZeal:	And now I rarely see them below 65
KingofZeal:	I don't believe that considering I haven't had one below 60, like, ever
cadance:	so i don't play arena anymore
cadance:	i'm lucky to get an arena deck with a score over like.... 56
willofd2011:	True lol ^w^
cadance:	exactly
KingofZeal:	Granted I did go 12 wins in arena on stream tonight with one hell of a sick mage deck
cadance:	no eyan you don't understand
cadance:	outside of the videos i post because those are always the best possible games
KingofZeal:	Don't have to, I can just watch myself
cadance:	you should watch me play hearthstone
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Like, you make me look like I could win the lottery on any given day with your luck
cadance:	like... sassy black lady bobbing her head with that stiff lip thing
cadance:	i need a sass emote
KingofZeal:	I'm pretty sure you quite possible have the worlds worst timing
cadance:	mhmm
willofd2011:	Party's over <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	I actually was seriously thinking of heading out
cadance:	*grabs the bleach out of the cabinet*
willofd2011:	XD
cadance:	WOW
KingofZeal:	Welp, Cadance is here, time to go to bed
willofd2011:	Lol
cadance:	most of the time
cadance:	i consider any time before 2am too early
cadance:	nah
willofd2011:	Is it bad that I consider any time before midnight too early to go to bed? Lol
cadance:	wow eyan you're still up?
KingofZeal:	Uh, probably like, 10ish
willofd2011:	Good question lol XD
Luckyskarm:	What is "Normal" tho
willofd2011:	Lol yeah
KingofZeal:	Eventually it will reach "normal" again
KingofZeal:	If I keep going to bed later and later and later
KingofZeal:	And I'll go like full circle, and then I'll eventually be normal
KingofZeal:	I figure that eventually, my sleep schedule will like, loop over
KingofZeal:	What a tragedy
willofd2011:	And it was very difficult trying not to fall asleep in class lol
willofd2011:	Actually my family would always make me wake up around 5 or 6
willofd2011:	Wow O.o
KingofZeal:	Needless to say, I was a zombie
KingofZeal:	I only had one semester where I had to wake up super early, as in the same time I woke up for high school which was 6ish
willofd2011:	Like during the fall semester of last year I took early morning classes and let's just say I would've been lucky to even get an ounce of sleep the entire semester lol
willofd2011:	Lol yeah
KingofZeal:	Feels good to know I'm not alone, lol
willofd2011:	That sounds like my own sleep schedule lol
willofd2011:	Lol XD
KingofZeal:	And that's how Eyan started going to bed at 4 in the morning
KingofZeal:	Usually if I got screwed and had an early schedule, I'd just accept getting only like, 3 hours of sleep 3 days a week
KingofZeal:	Cause I always did my best to minimize the days I went to college and I tried to go as late as possible
KingofZeal:	And it was all down hill from there
KingofZeal:	Then college came
KingofZeal:	I remember toward the end of high school, my schedule slowly decayed.  It went from 11 to 12, and by the time I graduated, it was like 1-2.  So I'd walk into school on like, 4-5 hours of sleep everyday
willofd2011:	My sleep schedule has always been messed up lol
willofd2011:	Dang lol
KingofZeal:	Stupid LCK is half the reason my sleep schedule is so screwed up with to begin with
KingofZeal:	As much as I can't wait for MSI tomorrow, I simultaneously wish it wasn't MSI cause I can't watch the Korean league play at this hour during MSI
willofd2011:	XD
KingofZeal:	Pshh, sleep is for the weak
willofd2011:	Lol yeah I'll do the same XD
KingofZeal:	Welp, now I don't know what to do with myself.  Maybe I should try that thing called going to bed
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	You make me feel like a social butterfly, lol
willofd2011:	I'm just a very shy person overall lol
willofd2011:	Not really
KingofZeal:	You aren't much of a talker huh?
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	But it felt like a cheap victory.  I won't probably be content unless I win with somebody that isn't OP
KingofZeal:	Then I beat it on Lunatic
KingofZeal:	I was gonna try to be productive tonight after stream, then I decided I was too tired for that and decided instead to play Touhou
willofd2011:	And you? ^w^
willofd2011:	Nothing much just relaxing and stuff lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	Sup
willofd2011:	Hi lol ^w^
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Oh look, a human
willofd2011:	It is a bit too quiet lol
KingofZeal:	Feels lonely man, it's so quiet here tonight
KingofZeal:	Hoozah, I beat Lunatic Touhou 16 demo with Aya.  Aya is so stupidly broken on lunatic
regal swan:	night all

Ex: ```diff
-This is coded red
```
The condition in this case is `-`
willofd2011:	Ah lol

Master9000:	gonna move this to <#305548986155008000> since this is pretty spammy

Strike:	oh
Strike:	also are banished people supposed to be allowed in commons and terra cave?
Master9000:	that too
Luckyskarm:	^There's an article that explains it

Deino Mite:	hey eyan, if you need any help testing stuff for the server, let me know cus i like helping
cadance:	oh well i gotta go might find out later
cadance:	how are you typing that without pinging everyone
Master9000:	oh its the damn `@everyone` role screwing it up again
SuperGummying:	Do it out what?
Master9000:	you could say that
Luckyskarm:	Why did they make you do it out of curiosity?
SuperGummying:	I know how to flirt with both genders well
SuperGummying:	It went very well
Luckyskarm:	How'd that go Gummy?
SuperGummying:	Strike no
Strike:	~~im basically a bot~~
SuperGummying:	I was pretending to be a girl btw
Luckyskarm:	~~they only wanted your body~~
Master9000:	coincidentally that was the reason you were allowed into it
SuperGummying:	Though the only testing I done was flirting with someone in that account
SuperGummying:	Don't forget gummy has access so he can do testing on the other server lol
Master9000:	oh yeah that too
SuperGummying:	And gummy
Strike:	this is m9k's secondary account
Luckyskarm:	That means someone did a bad.
Master9000:	doesnt explain ocean palace tho
Master9000:	strike has a permission to send messages in this one
Master9000:	wait wtf lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Modify the permissions for the channel itself
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~let me try~~
Strike:	the banish isnt working
Strike:	hey
Master9000:	eyan u wanna run any other stuff before stream or all done with discord plans for a while?
Master9000:	ok im home
Aqua033:	Like how I went against a full AP Maokai and Zac yesterday and went 10/3 in a 20 minute game?
Deino Mite:	sej is so op as a tank, but people are still retarded enough to play things like that in ranked
Deino Mite:	what a fun day of league of legends
Deino Mite:	even though there are no other tanks on the team
Deino Mite:	my sej jg is going full ap
SuperGummying:	So I can't really say
SuperGummying:	Regal you never gave me advice before
Deino Mite:	thats not how numbers work
Deino Mite:	gummy, that ends up being over 100%
regal swan:	wut am i
SuperGummying:	I'm surprised no one called me out for that yet
SuperGummying:	Dragonite is 100%
SuperGummying:	Master is .000000000000001
SuperGummying:	And ida you are .0000001

Ayana:	​i see through the lies of the mammon
Luckyskarm:	From Mee6
Ayana:	​from whomstdvent?
Luckyskarm:	I heard the tragedy of darth plagueis the moron
Ayana:	​did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?
Luckyskarm:	Exactly
Ayana:	​who?
Luckyskarm:	I was petting Darth
Ayana:	​*weaponizes*
Luckyskarm:	Actually
Kireina:	No petting the bot
Ayana:	​*bites*
Kireina:	no
Luckyskarm:	*pets*
Ayana:	​yes
Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	are you stupid
Kireina:	You can literally see the Bot tag
Ayana:	​and coders do make mistakes
Luckyskarm:	Lmao
Ayana:	​IM NOT A BOT
Kireina:	Bots*
Kireina:	Bot's don't make mistakes

Kireina:	Can we not have whatever the hell Cadance was tlaking about this morning? 🤔
Master9000:	the tail end of that message is in the throne room
Kireina:	rip
Master9000:	such as interperetation of the lines to which hte NSFW thing stretches
KingofZeal:	Unless of course you guys need me to make some sort of important decision
Master9000:	i should be back on my home computer which i can actually have do something right by 7
KingofZeal:	Once I have everything fully set up the way I want, I'm basically done managing this server, it's gonna be on the mods
KingofZeal:	Yes, I just haven't set the permissons up
Master9000:	and are we (gurus) supposed to be able to see the channel of the banished to address them or r u gonna do that directly if needed?
KingofZeal:	I don't need to disable them from seeing any channel, only goal is to block them from typing/speaking
Master9000:	and ofc u cant disable anyone from seeing the default channel so it doesnt mess up ***something***
KingofZeal:	k
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I had to use channel permissions but it did wor
Master9000:	you set it to that for each channel permission to over ride it?
KingofZeal:	I tested it last night on Jello
KingofZeal:	Btw RM, the banished role does work in preventing people from talking/typing if I set the permissions correctly.  Even if they have another that grants them permission
Master9000:	
Master9000:	these LTE send times are killing me
cadance:	that's exactly what i have
Master9000:	first priority is remove the disability of gurus to have this annoying popup in the corridors
Master9000:	
KingofZeal:	Now i just need to repermission everything and what not
KingofZeal:	There's 10 channels plus the throne room which will eventually become an affinity room once I figure that crap out
Master9000:	heres one from the shitty mac im stuck to rn
KingofZeal:	k, 8, that's what it should be
KingofZeal:	See ya
Dragonite:	arreviderci !
Master9000:	
superheronerd:	I'll see you guys later 👋🏼
Master9000:	one sec
KingofZeal:	RM, give me a screen cap of your channels list
KingofZeal:	The land bridge is still there, just doesn't welcome people cause it's redundant
cadance:	dammit don't beat me to my own punch line
Master9000:	yes very carefully
Master9000:	how do we steer?
cadance:	no ties to the rest of humanity
cadance:	guess we're just a floating island now
Master9000:	sorry cadance
cadance:	WELP
KingofZeal:	And so it was
Master9000:	the land bridge can now be severed
Master9000:	it is done
Tatsumaki:	🔊  |  **Welcome messages enabled on #lastvillage!**
Master9000:	1
Master9000:	t@welcome
Tatsumaki:	ℹ  |  **Channels with welcome messages in The Kingdom of Zeal**

`
#landbridge
`
Master9000:	2
Master9000:	t@welcome
Master9000:	ok
KingofZeal:	But I think this room is appropriate
Dragonite:	if that still exists
KingofZeal:	I was thinking of just having the welcome room here, the alternative would be the bot room
Dragonite:	bot spam
Master9000:	so which room should i switch welcomes to?
cadance:	i liked the land bridge but FINE
KingofZeal:	Don't need it
cadance:	well fine
cadance:	oh
KingofZeal:	I'm killing the land bridge
cadance:	only thing that really makes sense
superheronerd:	I think the theme is working quite nicely
cadance:	land bridge
Master9000:	want me to switch the bot to send welcomes to what room?
Master9000:	eyan if youre still here
cadance:	god i love xayah
cadance:	also, when you go 0/3 in lane but still end up out damaging the entire enemy team
Pogi:	Yeah, no stopping him I guess. heheexdee
cadance:	i am not here to judge, but to partake in the community
cadance:	oh well it's his shit he can do with it what he wants
Pogi:	^^^
cadance:	because eyan's taking the whole "themed server" thing a bit too far imo <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Pogi:	Why are these rooms named the way they are? Like, I get it's because of Chrono Trigger, but.... why?
Deino Mite:	theres still a chance. time to get challenjour and impress eyan!
KingofZeal:	See ya
Kugallyblitz:	welp, I gotta go amigos, class 😛
KingofZeal:	Most likely
KingofZeal:	If I did let you, I wouldn't let you speak
Kugallyblitz:	Hail to the King!
Deino Mite:	so if i played with you on stream in ranked, that wouldnt mean i get into the throne room? guess its back to devising plans to seize pow- I mean, all hail the King! hahaha
KingofZeal:	The throne room is reserved for people who can be in a call with me specifically when I'm streaming, so I wouldn't count on it.  I do plan to spend a fair amount of time in Enhasa/Kajar though when I get subs/patrons working
Deino Mite:	cus if so, i have even more motivation to climb
Deino Mite:	eyan, if i get good enough at league to play ranked with you, then do i get to be in the throne room?
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	My King is the king of all kings B)
KingofZeal:	Now I'm confusing myself
KingofZeal:	I did make the rules
Deino Mite:	wait, thats the republic
KingofZeal:	Wait
KingofZeal:	I didn't make the rules, I just abide by them
Deino Mite:	SPQR!
Deino Mite:	Emperor > King
KingofZeal:	You should expect no less from your King
Kugallyblitz:	I gotta say the rules tab looks waaaaaaay more organized from before, it may have costed you a soul or two but It was damn well worth it IMO
Deino Mite:	so, if i ever get good enough at league that you want to play ranked with me, i can get into the throne room?
Deino Mite:	ok
KingofZeal:	I'm going to attach that room to the affinity system once I make it
KingofZeal:	Throne room is my streaming room, needs new name belongs to my old skype group
Deino Mite:	what about needs new name and throne room?
Kugallyblitz:	very well done
KingofZeal:	It only cost my soul and several hours of my life
Deino Mite:	ah
Kugallyblitz:	why thanks
KingofZeal:	I kindly wrote that information out for everyone
Kugallyblitz:	oh wait nvm
Kugallyblitz:	corridors is prolly music, commons for whatever, and terra cave, for league?
KingofZeal:	Read the north cape
Deino Mite:	what are the different voice channels for?
Kugallyblitz:	ooh I just noticed voice channels
Deino Mite:	when you finish anime channel, i should be the first added <:VoHiYo:310828799589744641>
KingofZeal:	Like I said, still working on things
KingofZeal:	Anime channel is hidden
KingofZeal:	Cause it's disabled for the moment
Deino Mite:	also, where is the anime channel?
Deino Mite:	eyan, why dont i have permission to send messages in zealpalace
KingofZeal:	lol, so long as I can keep the number of overall rooms trimmed down.  Should this server expand though, I will gladly add rooms and I have a general plan in place should I need to
Kugallyblitz:	or will you... >:)
Kugallyblitz:	I see, just dont cut it when someone is in the process of crossing it
KingofZeal:	Only reason I haven't yet is cause I need to get the bot to point to another room
KingofZeal:	I'm actually probably gonna cut the land bridge, lol
Kugallyblitz:	landbridge is the welcome channel, thats neat like come over the bridge to get into the kingdom kinda thing I assume
KingofZeal:	Last night, after creating so more crap that I needed to, I realized that I really needed to thin things down, a lot
Dragonite:	i like how "corridors of time" is the music channel
Kugallyblitz:	yeah, I like how they are in neat order aswell, by my standards anyways
KingofZeal:	Looks super good and professional
KingofZeal:	I'm very proud of how the north cape turned out
Kugallyblitz:	jesus, sounds rough, Looks  great btw
KingofZeal:	I stayed up till 9 in the morning working on this server, and I still am not done
Kugallyblitz:	LOL good cos I have math class in like 15 min, and Im tired outta y mind aswell I like the sound of "bed
KingofZeal:	No, dear God not now
Kugallyblitz:	oops
Kugallyblitz:	oh wait I thought you said you were live
Kugallyblitz:	wow early
KingofZeal:	I LIVE, or not, I'm pretty dead.  Dear God I'm dead, so dead.
SuperGummying:	Dragonite is .50 lol
SuperGummying:	If you are talking about the listening percentage you are like .98 on it
SuperGummying:	And I am Stalin
SuperGummying:	What?
SuperGummying:	.80?
superheronerd:	Honestly I'm like .80 on the list?
Master9000:	In terms that gummy could understand, Trotsky, not Stalin
Master9000:	Yeah like sticking to an ideal
Dragonite:	i think they share the same root though
Dragonite:	adhere is more for ideals instead of physical things though
Master9000:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aqua033:	TIL
Aqua033:	Huh
Aqua033:	Wait what
Master9000:	
Aqua033:	There, now I'm stuck.
Aqua033:	*Tapes adhesive tape to the wall*
Dragonite:	_adheres Aqua to the wall_
Master9000:	^
Aqua033:	Adhesive and adhere are incredibly different.
Dragonite:	_adheres self to the wall_
Aqua033:	I mean, I sorta do.
Aqua033:	I adhere /s
Master9000:	You don't adhere
Master9000:	You hear
Master9000:	No
SuperGummying:	3 months later
SuperGummying:	I do listen
Master9000:	A fake one
Dragonite:	in what universe do you listen to dragonite
SuperGummying:	.000001
SuperGummying:	I also listen to ida and Dragonite
Master9000:	Shhh
Dragonite:	that sounds like a bomb
Master9000:	Pref m9k
Kireina:	thats too much fucking work
Master9000:	No that's deino
Kireina:	I don't wanna type out realmaster
Dragonite:	can i call you fakemaster?
Master9000:	Only Eyan's allowed to do that
Master9000:	Stop calling me rm
Kireina:	LOL
SuperGummying:	.00000001 for rm
Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	Ok well you can't lie to me about RM
SuperGummying:	.5 for blitz
SuperGummying:	.5 for Eyan
SuperGummying:	No it's Bella
SuperGummying:	I meant listening to friends
Kireina:	Bella, Eyan, and then the .5 being RM for some unknown reason that not even Gummy knows
SuperGummying:	I don't mean family guys
cadance:	wait what's this about a chat bot and why is mine the greatest of all time
SuperGummying:	What since when do I listen to ida?
Dragonite:	i'm not 100% convinced that he actually listens to his mom though
Kireina:	now it is accurate
Kireina:	There
Kireina:	Seems like the list expanded
Master9000:	Both*
Master9000:	Ida and Eyan are not .75
SuperGummying:	Yeah see
Kireina:	Gummy listens to 3.5 people*
Master9000:	He never listens  to me either so no point in me trying
SuperGummying:	Gummy listens to no one
Kireina:	lol
Dragonite:	everybody remind <@199725993416589313> that he has a chat bot to make, 'cause he's not listening to me
Aqua033:	Sounds good with me
Aqua033:	Alright
Dragonite:	_flings fish at Gummy_
SuperGummying:	Ida I said you would be a fish because you flop
Master9000:	Can we steer away from the nsfw a bit
Aqua033:	Me /s
cadance:	who's fckin with me
cadance:	i didn't do that
cadance:	wait why was that last message deleted
Kireina:	lol
Aqua033:	We didn't like him.
Aqua033:	I mean, the server I interact on the most once had someone who got arrested for possession of child porn
Dragonite:	_slow claps_
Master9000:	Tmi
cadance:	tbh i don't remember how i wound up there
regal swan:	gj dude
cadance:	and yes that's a true story
Dragonite:	> accidentally
Master9000:	That's why I don't do that shirt lmao
cadance:	pretty sure i got placed on an FBI watchlist when i accidentally found myself on an instagram page dedicated to child porn, granted i closed it immediately but my ip was in fact on that page soooooo i wouldn't be surprised if they come knocking at any time in the near future
Master9000:	Also <@212257792722075650> and I are probably gonna do archery stuff later this summer
Aqua033:	What the hell
Master9000:	Dude I modded nerf ammo with nails and learned to aim kitchen knives to a foot radius of the target
Aqua033:	Not only for what I say but what servers I'm on
regal swan:	i prefer flamethrowers
Aqua033:	That implies I'm not already on multiple
cadance:	pretty sure i'm the most school-shootery-ish out of anyone here <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	Until you get placed on an FBI watchlist
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eurovision now
Master9000:	That's pretty dank
Aqua033:	I mean, it's fun.
Aqua033:	So I kinda take up an edgy personality
regal swan:	in league they are
Aqua033:	I'm not actually violent, it's just a common joke that I look like a school shooter
Master9000:	Yes
cadance:	are you saying keyboards are the source of murder?
Neon Strike Kitty:	wtf why would I be a fish?
Master9000:	Because keyboards
regal swan:	kinda? then we went from fish to ponies
cadance:	welp we were having such a lovely conversation about ponies and now we're on to murder, the joys of internet chat rooms <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Aqua033:	Aww /s
Master9000:	Go for it
SuperGummying:	No
Aqua033:	Wait I missed a conversation about murder?
cadance:	i created my own magic, and by so doing transformed into an alicorn
SuperGummying:	Oh I forgot cadance
Master9000:	Close enough
cadance:	well i am horny but i'm not a pegasus
regal swan:	and lol
regal swan:	no
Master9000:	Oh you mean a horny Pegasus?
cadance:	gosh don't you people know anything <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	it means i have a horn AND wings
Master9000:	A demented acorn?
cadance:	tyvm
cadance:	gummy i'm an alicorn
SuperGummying:	Not a pony
cadance:	it's probably an earth pony
SuperGummying:	Cadance is a unicorn....
Master9000:	But my friend has a pony and I've never seen it do magic
regal swan:	yea duh
SuperGummying:	You haven't watch mlp have you master?
cadance:	magic, duh
Master9000:	How do ponies get their keyboards
Master9000:	Fine
cadance:	how should i know i'm not a fish
Master9000:	Where do they shop?
cadance:	they go shopping while you clean the tank
cadance:	nah man haven't you seen finding nemo?
Master9000:	Ok so just let the fish go out and find a naturally growing keyboard to use
cadance:	^^^^^^^^
SuperGummying:	I mean they don't have to pay for food
Master9000:	How can a fish afford that?
SuperGummying:	^
cadance:	ever heard of a waterproof keyboard?
Master9000:	He's got a point
regal swan:	but keyborads and water dont mix
Master9000:	Do they succeed even if they're careful?
cadance:	carefully
Master9000:	How do they aim
cadance:	he's got a point
SuperGummying:	With their tails
Master9000:	How so
SuperGummying:	Yeah they can
regal swan:	fish cant type
SuperGummying:	Ida are you sure you are not a fish?
cadance:	same though
regal swan:	?
regal swan:	lol u done with life too
Neon Strike Kitty:	If you'd let me know sooner I would have waited
regal swan:	anyone want to go on a murdering spree with me?
cadance:	3 years later i realized she probably wasn't into me and was only using me to go see the movies <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	what else was i supposed to do except ask her on dates to go see them
cadance:	well she was cute, had a great personality, and an even better ass, and she was an avid twilight fan.... seriously i heard her talking about it with her friends at least twice a day
Neon Strike Kitty:	🤦
cadance:	only reason i know that werewolves weren't introduced until new moon is because i put myself through the last 4 twilight movies because i was trying to get laid in high school
Neon Strike Kitty:	lol
cadance:	purely for this conversation
cadance:	or in this case 64
cadance:	http://www.freevampires.net/young/yd4226_64.html
cadance:	btw literally the only reason i know this is because i googled "read twilight new moon online" and went to page 65
Neon Strike Kitty:	Why do you know this?
cadance:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	so your name is better
cadance:	but the whole "hearing thoughts" thing is cooler
cadance:	well page 64 of new moon is where jacob tells bella that the pack killed laurent.... so i guess that would be okay
Neon Strike Kitty:	A friend of mine used to be called Twilightwolf64, I picked the name to mock him.
Neon Strike Kitty:	*flops*
cadance:	I WIN
cadance:	page 65 of new moon is where jacob reveals that the werewolves can hear each other's toughts
cadance:	hold on
Divexz:	You're an avid twilight fan?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I only have guesses as to what the name means, I'm asking for guesses on why I'm using it.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because it's irrelevant?
cadance:	if you don't even know then how are we supposed to guess
SuperGummying:	Does that mean I got it right?
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's probably got something to do with wolf link, I don't know for certain
SuperGummying:	Because of wolf link?
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's not the reason
SuperGummying:	Zelda
SuperGummying:	Yeah I have
Neon Strike Kitty:	You haven't guessed it
SuperGummying:	I guess it first
SuperGummying:	Give me my cookie
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes
SuperGummying:	Ida it's a zelda server?
SuperGummying:	I want to never go to school
superheronerd:	I want to not go to class ✨
SuperGummying:	I want caffeine
regal swan:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	It is a Zelda thing. Probably.
Kireina:	65 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kireina:	at night...
Kireina:	Is it because you herd sheep? 🤔
Kireina:	Coffee makes the world go round
Dragonite:	is it a zelda thing
Neon Strike Kitty:	You get a cookie if you can guess why
Neon Strike Kitty:	Apparently I'm named Twilightwolf65 in one of my servers
Luckyskarm:	Grats
willofd2011:	Lol
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **regal swan leveled up!**
regal swan:	why we destroying caffeine?

Aqua033:	Yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	wtf, everything's different!
Kireina:	xd
SuperGummying:	Take them
Kireina:	or do you want me to die 🤔
Kireina:	Well I kinda have to take them
SuperGummying:	Drugs are no good
Kireina:	I blame drugs
Kireina:	and I'm always wide awake too
Kireina:	It is
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	Spooky
Kireina:	Unless of course I sleep at 9am then...well... idk since I haven't gotten that far yet xd
Kireina:	No matter what time I sleep I always wake up by 9am
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	Ideally this is around when I would wake up
Kireina:	I don't think you can have fun during an exam 🤔

Rainy:	It's the future Gummy
SuperGummying:	Oh wow this place got a make over
Master9000:	Well that was a lot of reading with more enthusiasm than school had ever managed to get out of me
Master9000:	This is better than all of my school papers combined lmao
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> there's some #deleted channels in the description
Master9000:	
Master9000:	Holy shit 1145 new messages
Zaranius:	I forgot i had these screenshots of when my girlfriend did this to emerald
cadance:	yeah there's no way i got carried, i just died in lane more than i should have
cadance:	and i outdamaged her and their kha
cadance:	granted this last game i got carried to hell and back because camille destroys adc's who go top once she gets e but
cadance:	actually now that i think about it i didn't really get carried.... i had almost double camille's cs
cadance:	so far i don't think i've lost a game with xayah top building cleaver, mallet, hurricane, botrk
JelloHammer:	Alrighty, night folks
KingofZeal:	I too am heading out, I'll figure out the rest of this channel stuff in the morning
KingofZeal:	bye
wolverale12:	<:jpakHi:284220604234727425> cya guys
wolverale12:	-____-
wolverale12:	dad has the wifi setup so it shuts off at 2:30 and turns back on at 5

Zaranius:	<:loliF:218422129304010752>
wolverale12:	You've CLEARLY never seen me before
JelloHammer:	I wonder
wolverale12:	I wonder who I am <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Ah
Zaranius:	Kingofhyrule
KingofZeal:	Who are you on twitch Zaranius
Zaranius:	My sister did lol
Zaranius:	and no i did not draw that xD
JelloHammer:	Noice

KingofZeal:	Got it
KingofZeal:	**test**
wolverale12:	google it
JelloHammer:	hold on
JelloHammer:	master posted this a bit back
JelloHammer:	um
JelloHammer:	does it have the same perfect ass that sinon has
KingofZeal:	How do you bold text on discord
JelloHammer:	Question though
Zaranius:	There's an Asuna one aswell
JelloHammer:	and Sinon
cadance:	because sinon is waifu
JelloHammer:	Cuz Shingeki no Kyojin
Zaranius:	Why is this costume a thing on god Eater?!
wolverale12:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JNo0bcAMzM
wolverale12:	pokemon, digimon, and megaman nt warrior
wolverale12:	I watched like 3 animes
JelloHammer:	Important image to share
wolverale12:	Didn't interest me though tbh
wolverale12:	my friends played that all the time during lunch at high school
wolverale12:	also about yugioh cards since you mentioned it
wolverale12:	I gave it to my cousin actually who got rid of it also when I asked if they still had it when I wanted it back
wolverale12:	since those are worth something now
wolverale12:	I'm so mad at my younger self
wolverale12:	I got rid of it
wolverale12:	I USED to have a lot of the old cards but
JelloHammer:	anime is just meme-y lol
wolverale12:	I have 2 binders of pokemon cards
JelloHammer:	yugioh is way better as a card game than as an anime
Zaranius:	I was a pokemon boy
KingofZeal:	They all had all 3 of those things but each one did one thing best
JelloHammer:	Its the holy trinity
wolverale12:	since I hated the anime for that
wolverale12:	I'm ashamed that I owned yugioh cards as a kid
JelloHammer:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	When I was younger people used to say, digimon-anime, pokemon-games, yugioh-cards.
JelloHammer:	I did own some digimon playing cards
Zaranius:	Same
JelloHammer:	However
JelloHammer:	I too have never played one
KingofZeal:	Despite liking the anime, I too have never played a digimon game
wolverale12:	"BLASPHEMY" ~ pokemon fans here
wolverale12:	but I prefer it over pokemon for the coolness
wolverale12:	I haven't played a digimon game
wolverale12:	also just to put it out there
wolverale12:	so smurt
wolverale12:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
wolverale12:	>was watching the anime before that
wolverale12:	I can't believe I once thought that pokemon games were for kids
wolverale12:	I got into the pokemon games late...
JelloHammer:	Everyone is gonna choose differently based on what they've experienced and what they lik/dislike
wolverale12:	just like how Heartgold was my first pokemon game and I refuse to put any other pokemon games on top of it
KingofZeal:	I can understand some people not liking season 4, but I saw it before the other seasons, so I had nothing to compare it to.  Most people struggle with season 4 purely on the basis of no partner digimon
wolverale12:	but he started out with it xP
JelloHammer:	There's no such thing as an unbiased opinion lol
JelloHammer:	Honestly, everyone's biased
KingofZeal:	I am biased
wolverale12:	lol
wolverale12:	hmm, but you're biased as you said during the stream
KingofZeal:	The 4th season was solid so long as you were somebody who could tolerate the idea that they became digimon instead of having a partner.  After that, it went downhill
wolverale12:	that's when I stopped
wolverale12:	digimon tamers
wolverale12:	season 3
wolverale12:	ah yes
wolverale12:	I stopped at the third season I think?
wolverale12:	where there was the digimon that couldn't talk, and something that digimon was only a video game for the first episode, and then he got a real digimon in it
wolverale12:	also btw about the digimon anime
wolverale12:	It's so ugly, I forgot
wolverale12:	oh god
wolverale12:	_looks at the art for the sun and moon anime artstyle_
JelloHammer:	I was never on the Azu-nyan train
JelloHammer:	Mugi and Mio are so bae
JelloHammer:	STill hilarious though lol
JelloHammer:	I know
cadance:	mugi just wanted to be smacked
wolverale12:	I don't know if you guys will like it though
wolverale12:	Ash is annoying as ever is all I can say...
JelloHammer:	is it that bad?
JelloHammer:	lol
wolverale12:	I regretted that decision...
wolverale12:	I actually watched the sun and moon anime recently
wolverale12:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
wolverale12:	it died when I grew up and got tired of Ash
wolverale12:	oh wait, I'm wrong
wolverale12:	I think the anime died once Ashes voice changed imo
JelloHammer:	alongside team rocket
JelloHammer:	Brock was imo the best part of Pokemon
wolverale12:	cya
willofd2011:	Night all <3
wolverale12:	I think he got denied there
JelloHammer:	and tracey took his place
JelloHammer:	Also, didnt brock stay behind with professor ivy for a while?
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **wolverale12 leveled up!**
wolverale12:	Ash confirmed to be using gameshark since that moment
JelloHammer:	Night will!
wolverale12:	"pikachu the horn!"
willofd2011:	So I wish you guys a good night/morning ^w^
KingofZeal:	Also good night Will
wolverale12:	Ash used hacks
KingofZeal:	Which is ironic considering he can't win a Pokemon league or even take a match off an E4 member
wolverale12:	let's be honest eyan
KingofZeal:	He actually beat the battle frontier
KingofZeal:	Ash did one thing good
willofd2011:	Welp im gonna head to bed cause I'm on the verge of falling asleep lol
KingofZeal:	Actually
wolverale12:	I hate Ash
wolverale12:	If you can't tell
JelloHammer:	Even I have accomplished more than Ash in my month of playing Emerald
wolverale12:	Even Eyan has accomplished more than Ash with his last 2 LP's <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
JelloHammer:	And then brock decides to go anyways
wolverale12:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768> Ash as a trainer
KingofZeal:	I remember it cause she was probably the most waifu thing in all of the anime for me, so I was cheering for Brock
wolverale12:	How the heck did he lose when he had a greninja and a freaking goodra
KingofZeal:	Yes
JelloHammer:	Was it the Pike Queen?
JelloHammer:	Who was it that legitimately fell in love with Brock?
wolverale12:	<:WutFace:305610045910024192>
wolverale12:	I can't watch because of Ash...
KingofZeal:	Digimon was legit anime
KingofZeal:	Digimon no, Pokemon kinda
wolverale12:	<@!304073163669766158> Would you consider the digimon and pokemon "anime" more like cartoons
JelloHammer:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	classic K - on moe scene
JelloHammer:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieHk5FDb0s4
JelloHammer:	mhm
KingofZeal:	At least New Game is getting a second season
JelloHammer:	yeah
KingofZeal:	Eromanga is more than that
KingofZeal:	I generally define moe as cute girls doing cute things
JelloHammer:	Sagiri is too jailbait for it
KingofZeal:	Hinako Note is just not doing it for me, I dropped it
JelloHammer:	Yes
KingofZeal:	Although this current anime season is seriously lacking in good moe anime
KingofZeal:	I may or may not like moe trash
JelloHammer:	Right, <@!304073163669766158> ?
wolverale12:	I consider those to be cartoons
wolverale12:	and megaman nt warrior
JelloHammer:	Eyan knows what moe trash is
wolverale12:	digimon and pokemon
wolverale12:	the "anime" I watch I consider more cartoons
JelloHammer:	so dont worry
JelloHammer:	not weeb
JelloHammer:	see
wolverale12:	_has no idea what that is_
JelloHammer:	so rest easy
JelloHammer:	you aint a a weeb
JelloHammer:	if you are not addicted to moe trash
wolverale12:	xD
wolverale12:	I'm not even sure I could consider myself a "weeb" since I don't even watch anime (or care much about it)
JelloHammer:	OKAy
JelloHammer:	IM A WEEB
JelloHammer:	I KNOW
JelloHammer:	I KNOW
JelloHammer:	Its essentially the same thing lol
JelloHammer:	I was thinking ecchi
JelloHammer:	oh fair enough
KingofZeal:	erotic
JelloHammer:	what ERP
JelloHammer:	I know what RP is
wolverale12:	I tried to make a channel only certain people in 1 group could see it but, mods could see it also :/
JelloHammer:	ERP?
wolverale12:	I wish you could hide certain channels from fellow mods also...
cadance:	i need my ERP dungeon <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	but yeah i wish you could hide voice channels too
wolverale12:	that's an awfully nice voice channel you have there <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	But I'm tired and don't feel like thinking about this anymore
cadance:	alright
KingofZeal:	I need to go through and adjust permissions on everything
cadance:	there you go
cadance:	well to be fair, you still have it set that gurus can edit the channel
KingofZeal:	Only for voice v_v
KingofZeal:	It annoys me that channels you can't join aren't hidden
cadance:	yes i can see it
JelloHammer:	Yes
JelloHammer:	why they gotta do this with everything
KingofZeal:	You guys can see the Throne Room voice channel right?
JelloHammer:	goddamit dubai
JelloHammer:	rip
JelloHammer:	okay so it isnt fixed
cadance:	and roboty
cadance:	like it's very stuttery
cadance:	i can only sort of hear you
cadance:	why did they rework sejuani when she was still decent and aatrox's kit is garbage
JelloHammer:	also, can someone help me test if discord is still blocked here?
KingofZeal:	*glares*
JelloHammer:	*rainbow*
JelloHammer:	The more you know
JelloHammer:	I didnt know there was a place in CT called "Needs New Name"
willofd2011:	Mhm
JelloHammer:	Fair enough
KingofZeal:	Technically realmaster did, but he's a guru
JelloHammer:	I think master has already reached it tho
JelloHammer:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	Looks like Gummy will hit it first
JelloHammer:	so far from blue ogan
JelloHammer:	Im still at level 13
willofd2011:	XD
KingofZeal:	I'm a God
JelloHammer:	they succeeded
KingofZeal:	2 level ups in one night
KingofZeal:	Wow
JelloHammer:	If so
KingofZeal:	#conspiracytheory
JelloHammer:	to find lolicons in real life
JelloHammer:	was just an FBI plot
JelloHammer:	Eromanga Sensei
JelloHammer:	What if
JelloHammer:	I suddenly had a revelation
JelloHammer:	You know what
JelloHammer:	Plus we were all on lists as is lol
KingofZeal:	Oh, I know
JelloHammer:	Eyan, you know this is true
KingofZeal:	*cough*
JelloHammer:	After watching Episode 5 of Eromanga Sensei, we certainly are
cadance:	we're all going to hell anyway <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	well
KingofZeal:	Or just say to hell with it all together
KingofZeal:	I was gonna have a channel that was for a game of the week type of thing but I could just make it an all purpose gaming chat
KingofZeal:	I have an online gaming channel which I intend to keep
cadance:	at the sam;e time
cadance:	and a prehistoric frog
cadance:	hey i'm a kilwala
JelloHammer:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	Im getting excited just thinking about it
cadance:	probably
JelloHammer:	So many wonderful songs I could request
KingofZeal:	I think the Pokemon channel can be slashed
BreeZaps:	Oh okay
cadance:	he's gonna take song requests on stream and that's how he's gonna do it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	That's already the plan Bree
JelloHammer:	Fair enough
KingofZeal:	I intend to use it more Jello
BreeZaps:	I think if there is gonna be patreon and sub just mix them into one supporter group.
KingofZeal:	But yeah, I think for now we can keep that to mammon machine
JelloHammer:	Honestly, I dont see many people aside from master9000 really using it
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Not to sit around discussing music, lol
cadance:	oh
KingofZeal:	It's meant to be a channel purely to control the music bot
JelloHammer:	Well, we need to see how important the music aspect is to the server I suppose
cadance:	yeah i don't think enough people here discuss music to warrant having a channel dedicated to it
KingofZeal:	Cause I have the sub channel also
KingofZeal:	Oh, yeah, I can actually see 4 channels
KingofZeal:	I'm thinking we can cut the sunkeep
cadance:	oh right
KingofZeal:	The throne room silly
cadance:	which one is it
BreeZaps:	Lets see. Just make a gaming channel and put all the gaming stuff into one.
cadance:	WHOA
cadance:	i CAN?
KingofZeal:	And so can Cadence
KingofZeal:	Well, Jello can see one of them
KingofZeal:	Granted, I can see an extra three channels you guys can't
JelloHammer:	Yes
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I'm gonna need to do some trimming down on the channels.  Sometimes you have to create crap to know what you don't actually need
BreeZaps:	Same.
JelloHammer:	It changed my opinion of him completely
JelloHammer:	One short story of Warrior I actually really liked was Goosefeather's Curse
BreeZaps:	The lesson for the book is a good one and kids could learn from it.
BreeZaps:	Yeah
BreeZaps:	And he goes on a journey to get revenge but in the end learns a lesson
JelloHammer:	no blood
JelloHammer:	And they're off screen
JelloHammer:	Yeah
BreeZaps:	But I feel Tallstars revenge is perfect. Only one or two deaths.
JelloHammer:	Yep
BreeZaps:	Yeah because of the plot themes and all the deaths.
JelloHammer:	crookedstars promise*
JelloHammer:	I cant see them doing Crookedstars revenge or bluestars prophecy
JelloHammer:	Oh yeah
BreeZaps:	If they go down that road I hope they do Tallstar's revenge
BreeZaps:	Don't need to squeeze stuff in or cut stuff out
BreeZaps:	Perfect length
BreeZaps:	There the best books to be made movies
BreeZaps:	I swear if the movie sucks I will be mad. If they do make a Warriors movie they need to do super editions.
cadance:	i get that the show was heavily inspired by chinese culture, but come on
cadance:	but shyamalan said he wants everone from the earth kingdom to be asian
cadance:	there are rumors that chloe grace moritz will play toph, which i think would be amazing cuz she was an awesome hitgirl
BreeZaps:	For warriors
BreeZaps:	I hope the first 2 books is a movie then the next two books
JelloHammer:	yeah, I heard
cadance:	he confirmed it in 2015
cadance:	he's actually going through with the sequel
cadance:	wanna know the best part
JelloHammer:	jfc what was he veen thinking
JelloHammer:	dont you talk about shyamalan's disaster
JelloHammer:	omfg
cadance:	granted it was terrible but he did it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	he condensed 23 episodes, like 12 hours of content, into an hour and a half
cadance:	do what shyamalan did for last airbender
JelloHammer:	Imagine adapting 36+ books lol
cadance:	i don't think it'll be that hard with today's tech, and it'll probably turn out like harry potter tbh
JelloHammer:	like, how much can you even condense into 1.5 hours
JelloHammer:	Adapting Warriors is going to be VERY difficult
BreeZaps:	Yup.
BreeZaps:	Yeah same.
JelloHammer:	Which is why I was legit baffled when you told me that one exists lol
JelloHammer:	Thats why i thought it would never be a thing
JelloHammer:	Yeah, I agree with what she says
JelloHammer:	<@137277936238592000> And lets not even talk about New Prophecy with all the cats getting axed from hunger
BreeZaps:	This video was made before the movie was announced. It's a good listen and brings up what I wanted to say. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRJmTkhZ_8
cadance:	eyan pls everyone knows i'm a troll and i haven't been banned <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	He died ina  horrendously painful way
JelloHammer:	I have to admit
BreeZaps:	It's different reading it
JelloHammer:	You know as much as I hated Tigerstar
BreeZaps:	Think. Yellowfang murdered her own son. Cinderpelt getting hit by a car, bluestar going insanely mad. There is so much dark stuff in the books. I don't think kids can watch it
JelloHammer:	*cough* Scourge *cough*
JelloHammer:	lol
JelloHammer:	Oh yeah
BreeZaps:	*as movies
BreeZaps:	If they do the first series as books.
BreeZaps:	If Warriors gets turned into a movie think about all the deaths and dark scenes.
BreeZaps:	How times have changed
JelloHammer:	Though warriors has usually been okay with killing off characters
BreeZaps:	Idk if I spelt it right but anyways
BreeZaps:	Bonded
BreeZaps:	I found out about the books in 2010. Then I joined the forums and "her" and I bounded over the books.
JelloHammer:	Yeah
BreeZaps:	There is no real on screen deaths just off screen like talltail's father buried alive but I am sure the whole journey part of the book can be a good movie thing.
cadance:	you know it's funny, she who must not be named was actually the one who introduced me to warrior cats
JelloHammer:	yes
BreeZaps:	The plot fits it well
JelloHammer:	Some of the books in that were eeh
BreeZaps:	But Tallstars revenge is the best warrior cats book for the screen
JelloHammer:	Though I didnt really care much for New prophecy
JelloHammer:	Every book can be turned into a movie lol
JelloHammer:	Oh yeah
BreeZaps:	That book can easily be turned into a movie
JelloHammer:	Followed by Dawn of the Clans
JelloHammer:	Power of Three my favourite series
BreeZaps:	My fav book is Tallstars revenge
JelloHammer:	Crookedstar's promise and Tallstar's Revenge are my favourite Super Editions
JelloHammer:	Though Crookedstar is a close second
JelloHammer:	My favourite has always been jayfeather lol
BreeZaps:	Weird
JelloHammer:	Nope
JelloHammer:	so I can finally get my hands on it
BreeZaps:	Is there no gift card for that
JelloHammer:	should be getting one next month
JelloHammer:	and I need a credit card for that
BreeZaps:	Okay
JelloHammer:	I buy it on kindle
BreeZaps:	If u have apple
BreeZaps:	Get a iTunes card and go to iBooks and buy the books
JelloHammer:	Cant find it anywhere and i dont have a credit card to buy it feelsbadman
BreeZaps:	Now
BreeZaps:	You should
JelloHammer:	Ah, I havent started vision of shadows yet
willofd2011:	Lol
BreeZaps:	Of vision of shadows
cadance:	damn yall are nuts about it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	The latest one i read was bramblestars storm
BreeZaps:	The newest book yea
JelloHammer:	Is it a new one?
BreeZaps:	Have u read shattered sky
JelloHammer:	But yeah, its amazng
BreeZaps:	Okay
JelloHammer:	like 2 times over
BreeZaps:	Oh
JelloHammer:	just not 5 times over lol
JelloHammer:	Oh ive read dawn of the clans
JelloHammer:	the vision of shadows one
BreeZaps:	READ DAWN OF THE CLANS
JelloHammer:	I forget what its called
JelloHammer:	and the new series
JelloHammer:	except dawn of the clans
JelloHammer:	I've read the entire series like 5 times over
BreeZaps:	Lol
willofd2011:	Tfw you're feeling tired yet not tired at the same time lol
BreeZaps:	<@!128672344624463872> dude it was announced last year
JelloHammer:	lol*
JelloHammer:	Ive been waiting for a movie of this sicne i started reading it lo
JelloHammer:	how did i not know about this
JelloHammer:	holy shit
KingofZeal:	Or rather I suppose there are just certain things I have no desire to touch after what I went through
KingofZeal:	Too many things trigger me.  v_v
cadance:	too bad eyan won't watch it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	You cannot be serious
BreeZaps:	Look it up
BreeZaps:	Lol
JelloHammer:	HOW
JelloHammer:	WHEN
JelloHammer:	WHAT
JelloHammer:	WARRIORS MOVIE
JelloHammer:	WAIT WHAT
BreeZaps:	On the screen
BreeZaps:	My fav books
BreeZaps:	Warriors cats will be turned into a movie so I'll watch that when it comes
JelloHammer:	ah okay
KingofZeal:	It was at Otakon
KingofZeal:	Too bad those memories are mildly tainted by you know who
JelloHammer:	Was this back in the day?
JelloHammer:	Oh thats awesome
KingofZeal:	It was quite amazing
KingofZeal:	I had the privilage of seeing it's first official dub airing on the big screen
JelloHammer:	who's WAY in the deep furry end
JelloHammer:	I know one person
JelloHammer:	Eh you arent the biggest I've met
cadance:	meanwhile i'm probably the biggest furry you'll ever meet <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	Wolf Children is pretty much hailed as a classic
KingofZeal:	This is coming from somebody who doesn't care for furry shit
JelloHammer:	Its actually a very heartwarming story
KingofZeal:	It's not that furry, trust me
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Lol, it's called wolf children for a reason
BreeZaps:	Books do
BreeZaps:	Anime just never interested me
BreeZaps:	Idk yet i'll see
JelloHammer:	Those are actually better in the English dub, so you might wanna check those out if listening to Japanese isnt your thing
BreeZaps:	The movie looks weird they have tails
JelloHammer:	And of course Cowboy Bebop and Baccano
JelloHammer:	Even classics like Akira and Ghost in the Shell
JelloHammer:	Summer Wars
JelloHammer:	The Girl that Leapt through Time
JelloHammer:	Anything by Satoshi Kon's good
cadance:	howl's moving castly and spirited away might freak you out too much <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	not TOO weird
cadance:	ponyo's a good one to start with
JelloHammer:	LUL
JelloHammer:	Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle etc
cadance:	ay jellooooo
cadance:	watch literally any Miyazaki film
JelloHammer:	A lot of the Studio Ghibli stuff is amazing
BreeZaps:	The only anime I watch is Pokemon because well... It's Pokemon
JelloHammer:	Tentacle stuff is only in hentai, dont worry
KingofZeal:	But I bet you you'd see anime a bit differently after watching it
KingofZeal:	Well, I dunno
KingofZeal:	I guarentee you'll like it, if I'm wrong...
KingofZeal:	Look up a movie called Wolf Children
KingofZeal:	Bree
KingofZeal:	I mean, I don't have an issue with it.  😛
BreeZaps:	That and I am worried about seeing weird stuff.
cadance:	>implying waifus and weebs are a bad thing <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	There's plenty of good stuff, it's just kinda hidden behind all the waifus and weebs
KingofZeal:	Most people who hate anime are usually just blinded by all the sterotypes about anime
cadance:	who doesn't like anime wow not being a weeb in 2017 <:LUL:305559915714576385>
BreeZaps:	I use the mute button for every discord I use besides one of them.
KingofZeal:	Good thing there is a convienent mute button
BreeZaps:	here comes haters
JelloHammer:	ANIME YE BOI
BreeZaps:	Lol
BreeZaps:	i h8 anime
BreeZaps:	Oh god. Not anime
JelloHammer:	Closest I could find
JelloHammer:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPmQqNXisyk
JelloHammer:	Mountain of Woe sounds like a power metal song
willofd2011:	Lol
cadance:	well excuse me for getting here in the middle of a conversation <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Nah, it has plastic casing
BreeZaps:	Does mountain of woe have jail cells
JelloHammer:	LUL
JelloHammer:	9/11?
KingofZeal:	That's cause I'm still making them ya numpty
cadance:	i see only 10 channels
KingofZeal:	And enhasa will be for subs/patrons once I get that set up
KingofZeal:	Also you guys can't see mountainofwoe
KingofZeal:	To hell if I remember
KingofZeal:	Or was it 11
KingofZeal:	Only 9 of the channels are talking channels
JelloHammer:	Power overwhelming
BreeZaps:	Seems overwelming
JelloHammer:	wa wa wee wa
BreeZaps:	Do we need that much channels?
JelloHammer:	15 channels
willofd2011:	Wow lol
JelloHammer:	Woah there
KingofZeal:	Should be 15 text channels, and technically 6 voice channels when I'm done.  Granted two of the voice channels are for me and my stream people
BreeZaps:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Perhaps more than we need, but oh well
BreeZaps:	Lol
BreeZaps:	So.... Much.... Channels...
BreeZaps:	Don't worry I will only spam to crash the discord server Kappa
KingofZeal:	Yeah, once I'm happy with the way everything is set up
willofd2011:	My icon is actually something that I made lol
BreeZaps:	So I can spam there
KingofZeal:	That's basically the meme channel
BreeZaps:	Can we have a chat just for spamming
KingofZeal:	I'm making channels now cause almost everyone is asleep so there's less people to disrupt the process, lol
JelloHammer:	Idk vegetables and topping interfere with the taste imo
willofd2011:	Okie dokie ^w^
JelloHammer:	Mozzarella 4 life
JelloHammer:	Pizza for me is just good old cheese and tomato sauce
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **KingofZeal leveled up!**
KingofZeal:	You should show me some of your work.  I might be able to utilize your art once I start doing YouTube again
BreeZaps:	Does pineapple belong on pizza?
willofd2011:	Yep ^w^
KingofZeal:	You do drawings right?
JelloHammer:	fkin beautiful
KingofZeal:	Hey Will
JelloHammer:	that transition from pre end to post end
BreeZaps:	And one of the bosses was skarmory
JelloHammer:	I will say this about MD1
willofd2011:	Yeah lol
KingofZeal:	MD1 was great, they just dropped you in and said, GO
JelloHammer:	Tiny Woods I think it was called
JelloHammer:	no boss
JelloHammer:	just a 3 floor dungeon
BreeZaps:	I'm 20 now so haha
JelloHammer:	MD 1 had a pretty short tutorial iirc
BreeZaps:	We all are
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	I have realized though that sky is pretty long in it's tutorial phase too.  Maybe I'm just getting too old, I dunno
BreeZaps:	The story was good.
BreeZaps:	I just loved the plot twist at the end
willofd2011:	True lol
KingofZeal:	It suffers from "too long of a fricken tutorial" syndrome
BreeZaps:	Yea
BreeZaps:	Once u get through the beginning trust me
KingofZeal:	I watched OddOne play the whole game though, it looked like it got a lot better
KingofZeal:	It was soooooo... meh to me
KingofZeal:	I could not get through the beginning of the game
KingofZeal:	I got probably about a third of the way through and stopped
BreeZaps:	It's good
BreeZaps:	Eyan have u even played the newest mystery dungeon?
JelloHammer:	But I've never played it
JelloHammer:	Funnily enough, I have the full guide for it back home lol
BreeZaps:	I played and it's good
willofd2011:	I agree sky is really good lol
JelloHammer:	Havent had the chance to play MD EotS, but I've heard its really good
KingofZeal:	I liked the originals, but Sky is definitely the best, it's not even really debateable
BreeZaps:	I love MD 1 and 2
JelloHammer:	I had a blast playing through it
JelloHammer:	imo the original mystery dungeon
BreeZaps:	Amazing games
BreeZaps:	Oh yea. The Gameboy Zelda games
BreeZaps:	What else
BreeZaps:	There is lots of games that is timeless. Like OOT, DK64 (for me at least) and the first 3 mario partys.
willofd2011:	Lol
JelloHammer:	bleh
JelloHammer:	goddamit i cant english today
JelloHammer:	or hand drawn desgigns, whichever
JelloHammer:	cuz im pretty sure he made the cg desgigns
JelloHammer:	Also, the moment I first saw the opening cutscene, I thought Akira Toriyama
KingofZeal:	Originally for the SNES, which makes it all the more impressive that it still stands up so well to this day.  It's a very timeless game
BreeZaps:	Is that when u first played it
KingofZeal:	There is a DS remake, yes
BreeZaps:	Yea
JelloHammer:	Is CT there for the ds?
KingofZeal:	Well, I'm gonna stream it after XCom probably Bree, just keep an eye on the announcements.  I also think it will be one of the YT series I do before the year is out if all goes according to plan
willofd2011:	I'll get to getting the game and playing it eventually lol
JelloHammer:	And im just lazy af
JelloHammer:	Unless there is
JelloHammer:	If only there was a pc version
JelloHammer:	But alas I have no method to play it
BreeZaps:	I don't want to play the game but I do want to watch it.
JelloHammer:	Actually sounds like a game I'd love
JelloHammer:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	I think streaming CT will be quite fun, can't wait to do so
KingofZeal:	But that's spoilers 😉
JelloHammer:	I can imagine
BreeZaps:	Then goes to save her like nothing happened
KingofZeal:	Watching the fall of Zeal is actually quite moving in the game, but that's probably also because it's attached to a bunch of other bad things happening all at once
BreeZaps:	Link ditched his girl to sleep for 100 years
willofd2011:	Lol
JelloHammer:	Yes
BreeZaps:	100 years
JelloHammer:	Still less than the time he slept for in BotW <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
JelloHammer:	I think so, yeah
BreeZaps:	Unless I'm wrong.
BreeZaps:	I think it's 7 years
BreeZaps:	You know how Link sleep for 7 years in OOT? I wish we could see how the destration went down.
JelloHammer:	Ah okay
KingofZeal:	As the Kingdom of Zeal actually falls during the events of the game
JelloHammer:	I see
KingofZeal:	It is the only time period though that has a distinct before and after though
KingofZeal:	No, just one
JelloHammer:	I have no knowledge of chrono trigger but I'm inferring that you visit the kingdom in two time periods?
KingofZeal:	Yeah, it's not a club you want to be in, lol
KingofZeal:	Aka when the Kingdom of Zeal existed
BreeZaps:	Sounds like the worst club ever lol. But yeah it sounds good.
KingofZeal:	All my channels are locations from Chrono Trigger's Antiquity time period
KingofZeal:	Plus I was looking for a use for the mountain of woe
KingofZeal:	The banned chat is just so you have a way to talk to the mods
KingofZeal:	Once I set it up across the board, it will ban speaking and typing
JelloHammer:	I dont think you can spam there though
KingofZeal:	Basically
JelloHammer:	Good policy.
BreeZaps:	So when you get the banned role do you get access to a banned only chat room club? Kappa
KingofZeal:	Pretty much
JelloHammer:	Better safe now than sorry later
KingofZeal:	I don't see myself ever needed a feature like that for the people that are currently here, but if I get trucking with stream/YouTube/everything, this place could easily grow out of control if I'm not prepared
BreeZaps:	If it works for you it's not crazy. It does sound good actually
KingofZeal:	I'm rebuilding my glorious Kingdom, and it will be glorious once again
KingofZeal:	I'm thinking long term
BreeZaps:	Okay
KingofZeal:	Keep in mind Bree, I'm also building for the future
KingofZeal:	But you could undo a ban, but a role is easier imo
JelloHammer:	Kicking, nope
JelloHammer:	Banning does, yes
KingofZeal:	Yes
willofd2011:	Yeah lol
BreeZaps:	Doesn't banning a person make it so they can never rejoin?
JelloHammer:	We don't want something like nazi moobot here lol
KingofZeal:	Kicking seems silly since they can just rejoin, banning seems tedious.  Plus I'm the kind of person who prefers bans to be permanent and I'd rather have an option available as a warning system of sorts
BreeZaps:	So you won't just kick them or just ban them so you made a role?
BreeZaps:	Interesting.
willofd2011:	Mhm ^w^
JelloHammer:	Works fine
JelloHammer:	Ah yes
KingofZeal:	The idea is I created a role for people who are tempoarily banned from talking for those who break the roles.  I hope to never have to use it but better to have it in place just in case
JelloHammer:	Just like Hook 3.0
JelloHammer:	Working as intended
willofd2011:	Welcome back lol
KingofZeal:	System working as planned
JelloHammer:	I am back
KingofZeal:	k, you should be back jello
BreeZaps:	🐱
KingofZeal:	You're gonna get access to a channel called mountainofwoe, if you can talk here, just talk here, if you can't, then tell me in mountainofwoe
JelloHammer:	Test away
KingofZeal:	Also, Jello, gonna test something with you again
KingofZeal:	Once I finish the twitch stuff, I'll be working on YouTube next, hopefully *crosses fingers*
KingofZeal:	Building a good solid foundation so that I can do all sorts of cool stuff
KingofZeal:	Got that twitch affiliate stuff
JelloHammer:	Thr british Equivalent for that is "Same shit different day"
KingofZeal:	Completely overhauling my twitch channel
KingofZeal:	But to seriously answer the question
willofd2011:	Lol
BreeZaps:	Oh
KingofZeal:	^
JelloHammer:	Death and Taxes is a common expression
KingofZeal:	Not recently at least
BreeZaps:	oh
KingofZeal:	No actual deaths
KingofZeal:	Oh, I was joking
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **BreeZaps leveled up!**
BreeZaps:	Death? Damn sorry to hear that
KingofZeal:	Death, taxes, trying to get my life together
JelloHammer:	Getting Jiggy with it
BreeZaps:	What has Eyan been up to
willofd2011:	Maybe <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
BreeZaps:	<:pauseCry:308062863056961546>
JelloHammer:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
BreeZaps:	No
JelloHammer:	LAUGH WITH ME DAMMIT
JelloHammer:	Because im fun
JelloHammer:	I have just heard TONS about them
BreeZaps:	Lol
BreeZaps:	How is it a fun fact
JelloHammer:	or*
JelloHammer:	I have not seen a single video of marriland of chugga
JelloHammer:	fun fact
willofd2011:	Lol XD
BreeZaps:	Inb4 "chugga notice me"
JelloHammer:	Good luck with that LOL
BreeZaps:	A stream with chugga? Yeahhhhhhhh
JelloHammer:	oh wow
BreeZaps:	So I can tell u what is happening this weekend. Marriland is streaming with Chugga for 24 hours with 2 other people. I am gonna die just moderating this chat.
willofd2011:	Lol
JelloHammer:	They wont be soon
JelloHammer:	and if there is
JelloHammer:	Nobody
willofd2011:	Who doesn't like cake lol
JelloHammer:	Even cakes like cake
JelloHammer:	Everyone likes cake
willofd2011:	XD
BreeZaps:	I like cake
JelloHammer:	IM THE KINGOFTEAL
JelloHammer:	IM TEAL NOW
JelloHammer:	Okay
KingofZeal:	Yo, jello, I may use you as a test subject for some stuff, just ignore the fact that you're randomly changing roles
willofd2011:	Lol
JelloHammer:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	But highly disturbing
JelloHammer:	Intriguing
JelloHammer:	Hmmm
BreeZaps:	It's like god gave u heaven in your mouth
BreeZaps:	The best food
willofd2011:	Lol
BreeZaps:	Thing in
BreeZaps:	The best
BreeZaps:	It is
JelloHammer:	lol
BreeZaps:	Lets say
BreeZaps:	Marriland is also vegetarian so he asked this many times.
JelloHammer:	what does it actually taste like?
BreeZaps:	It's good
JelloHammer:	but I've heard people rave and rant about it
JelloHammer:	I've never had bacon
JelloHammer:	As a vegetarian
JelloHammer:	Question
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
BreeZaps:	The world
BreeZaps:	Now I suddenly want a bacon burger
BreeZaps:	Just got done msging marriland this weekend is gonna be crazy
BreeZaps:	Hi
BreeZaps:	Just finished watching crazy videos
KingofZeal:	Oh snapples, it's Bree
willofd2011:	Hiya lol ^w^
JelloHammer:	What's up?
JelloHammer:	Heya Bree
BreeZaps:	Hi guys
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Don't spam my new channels fool
JelloHammer:	That was a fun show
JelloHammer:	Reminds me of me watching Amazing Race back in the day
JelloHammer:	wow okay then
KingofZeal:	Super boring, super predictable, and all the best people (which is the appeal of returning player seasons) are already gone
KingofZeal:	Normally, returning player seasons are good, I kinda just want this one to be over
willofd2011:	Ah lol
JelloHammer:	Rip
KingofZeal:	It's been a pretty crappy season tbh
KingofZeal:	Meh
JelloHammer:	Btw, how's survivor going?
KingofZeal:	Don't worry, I tend to agree with you
JelloHammer:	just my two cents
JelloHammer:	but eh
JelloHammer:	When people go, "Oh you cant laugh at that vulgar joke", its a bit off putting
JelloHammer:	But even at regular times
JelloHammer:	if nobody laughs, I mean
JelloHammer:	If you joke about something at the wrong time, then thats your fault lol
KingofZeal:	Or you can just be like me and say whatever you're thinking and then regret it later
JelloHammer:	Of course
KingofZeal:	Time and a place for everything
willofd2011:	Mhm
JelloHammer:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	People just lack a sense of humor when they get sensitive to jokes.  Intent is very key, and for some reason, intent seems to fly over a lot of people's heads
JelloHammer:	For to me, they are no less than any other form of humour
JelloHammer:	and innuendo
JelloHammer:	Thats why I am a huge advocate of puns
JelloHammer:	Laughing at them is what its for
JelloHammer:	its a joke
JelloHammer:	Like, I don't get society's take of "Oh, we can't laugh at that joke, its too vulgar, or its too stupid"
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	It's fun
KingofZeal:	I just like to screw around with people
JelloHammer:	as long as it doesnt attack people through it
JelloHammer:	I'm honestly an advocate of all kinds of humour really
JelloHammer:	that was it
JelloHammer:	SuggestiveSkarmory
KingofZeal:	Oh, I know
willofd2011:	No worries I've seen worse lol
JelloHammer:	What was it again?
JelloHammer:	Ah yes
KingofZeal:	I'd imagine I'd ruin a lot of people's childhoods if they knew what I became after the YouTube years, lol
JelloHammer:	No one thinks you're a nice guy <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	Eyan lets be honest
KingofZeal:	Will, you may think I'm some nice guy, but in reality, I'm a potty mouthed, horrible person who's probably going to hell.
JelloHammer:	and all the fanservice
JelloHammer:	and minus the 12 year old girl changing clothes camera
willofd2011:	*pretends she didn't see that and just moves on* lol
KingofZeal:	Minus the whole incest thing, lol
JelloHammer:	meanwhile Rokudenashi seems to be going good
KingofZeal:	Dunno why, it's pretty good
JelloHammer:	But yeah, its score is dropping drastically
willofd2011:	XD
JelloHammer:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	INNER SELF
JelloHammer:	YOUR TRUE
KingofZeal:	😛
JelloHammer:	YOU CANT HIDE
JelloHammer:	I saw that eyan
JelloHammer:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
KingofZeal:	Er, something
JelloHammer:	But its worth it for the memes
JelloHammer:	Eromanga Sensei makes me lose brain cells
JelloHammer:	Oh btw
JelloHammer:	lol
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	I like you Will, you operate on the same time schedule as me, except it's actually somewhat acceptable for you and really terrible for me, lol
JelloHammer:	There's still like 13 hours for that
willofd2011:	Same lol
KingofZeal:	Obviously
JelloHammer:	I'm not sleeping anytime soon lol
KingofZeal:	And then there were 3
KingofZeal:	Peace
SuperGummying:	Night guys
SuperGummying:	I should head off myself
SuperGummying:	Nvm I'm weak
SuperGummying:	Nah sleep is for the weak
KingofZeal:	Probably would be a wise choice
SuperGummying:	I do have school in the morning
SuperGummying:	Maybe I should sleep as well
KingofZeal:	Or something like that
KingofZeal:	Don't let the weedles bite
SuperGummying:	Hmmm
KingofZeal:	Sleep tight
KingofZeal:	Nightynight
superheronerd:	Have a good one, everybody
willofd2011:	Night ^w^
JelloHammer:	Goodnight bella!
SuperGummying:	K night
superheronerd:	Goodnight guys
superheronerd:	I think I'm going to attempt sleep
willofd2011:	Nice nice lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	It will all be laid out in the rules/regulations channel on the north cape when I'm done
SuperGummying:	Interesting
KingofZeal:	That's the channel breakdown
KingofZeal:	
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	lol
JelloHammer:	so, do we sing the lost Y.M.C.A?
JelloHammer:	We're the last village people
willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
JelloHammer:	Ah cool
KingofZeal:	I'm bringing to life what I've been working on for 3 days
KingofZeal:	Cause I'm reorganizing everything
JelloHammer:	also wtf why are the text channel names randomly changing LOL
JelloHammer:	Which I still maintain is a very good series
JelloHammer:	When I look back on it, the only reason I even liked it was that it was ever so slighty similar to the Warriors series by Erin Hunter
JelloHammer:	called Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole
JelloHammer:	that I was super into like 6 or something years ago
JelloHammer:	there was this movie
JelloHammer:	speaking of owls
JelloHammer:	Unsurprisingly, I won nothing
JelloHammer:	with the plot twist of the main villain being the mc's brother at the very end
willofd2011:	It was actually a research project about a specific animal and I did mine on snowy owls lol
JelloHammer:	I wrote some bs Fate/Stay Night like story
JelloHammer:	and we had to write a story based on "A dark and stormy night"
JelloHammer:	There was this competition
JelloHammer:	I wrote a lot of plot-twisty stories back then lol
KingofZeal:	I mean, let's be real, I can't even look at my early YouTube videos.  And that was 8th grade, let alone 3rd
JelloHammer:	Heya bella
JelloHammer:	Nop[e
willofd2011:	I'm tempted to redraw it tho lol
JelloHammer:	halfway through I went
superheronerd:	Hey jello
JelloHammer:	I had one attempt at writing one chapter
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	As they rightfully should be
willofd2011:	I've actually found the very first book I made a while ago back from the third grade. Long story short, the illustrations are a bit cringy lol
JelloHammer:	Sign me up
JelloHammer:	Dragons and Magic?
JelloHammer:	One of my favourite series of all time has to be the Inheritance Quadrilogy
KingofZeal:	And I think high school, cause that series took forever to write
JelloHammer:	That scared the crap out of me when I was young lol
KingofZeal:	Yea, he was my favorite author when I was in the middle school years
JelloHammer:	or whatever that series was called
JelloHammer:	The Power of Five
JelloHammer:	<@!304073163669766158> I remember you talking about Anthony Horowitz once
SuperGummying:	How about a brand new super Mario bros 3 blooper
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I'd like to think my YT work was an art in itself
SuperGummying:	Make a video
KingofZeal:	If I were to try something creative, I'd make a video game or something
KingofZeal:	Nah, I don't do writing anymore
willofd2011:	Can always rewrite it lol
SuperGummying:	Well Eyan might as well finish what you started
KingofZeal:	I think I reached chapter 4
KingofZeal:	Pretty sure I only was able to find the first chapter, the rest are lost to time
SuperGummying:	Not even one chapter?
willofd2011:	Good enough lol XD
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Pretty sure that's how I started it, lol
SuperGummying:	Not even one word?
KingofZeal:	It was a dark and stormy night
willofd2011:	One sentence? Lol
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	That would be a no
willofd2011:	Not even a small piece of it?
KingofZeal:	Save that for subbing
superheronerd:	I wrote a ton of short, terrible stories as a kid bored in the summertime haha
SuperGummying:	I'll donate $50
KingofZeal:	Nope, I will take it to my grave thank you very much.  😛
SuperGummying:	Eyan of if donate it to you right now can I read it?
Aqua033:	same
SuperGummying:	I wanna read it
willofd2011:	I might just be an author alongside being an artist lol
KingofZeal:	There was this series I liked when I was in elementary school called Hank the Cowdog.  Me being the young innocent derp I was wanted to mimic it using my dog.  I had all my "great" book titles planned out and even wrote the beginning chapters of the first book.  Oh God, it was pretty cringe to read when I found a copy of it house cleaning a year ago
SuperGummying:	Well Eyan you may not be an author but at least you own clg lol
Aqua033:	When I was young, I actually wanted to do things with my life
superheronerd:	I wanted to be an author too, actually
willofd2011:	And 3 or 4 large binders and several notebooks included into the collection lol
willofd2011:	7 years of work = stacks among stacks of papers lol
KingofZeal:	When I was real young, I wanted to be an author, that obviously didn't happen
willofd2011:	There are times where I do prefer writing over reading tho lol
willofd2011:	Dang
KingofZeal:	College killed my desire to read...  soooo many textbooks
superheronerd:	I used to be able to burn through huge books really quickly
SuperGummying:	I don't read anymore
willofd2011:	There's like at least quite a few books in every corner of my room lol
KingofZeal:	I used to read so much, now I'm lucky I touch a single book a year.  Did read a few light novels a while back though #weeb
willofd2011:	Dang lol
superheronerd:	So I understand haha
superheronerd:	I have a bookcase from floor to ceiling and 90% of it is books
willofd2011:	I have so many books that idk where to place them all lol
superheronerd:	What're you reading?
willofd2011:	Lol
superheronerd:	Books
superheronerd:	Oooh
willofd2011:	*gives gummy a random book*
SuperGummying:	Will can I borrow a book?
SuperGummying:	So many things happening at once
willofd2011:	*goes back to reading*
SuperGummying:	Ugh 😑
willofd2011:	Kinda was responding to two different responses but close enough lol
KingofZeal:	Penguins getting smashed is a bad thing v_v
SuperGummying:	I'm doing nothing
willofd2011:	Nice and oh noes D:
KingofZeal:	I watched the Penguins get smashed and sat around working on discord and stream stuff.  And yet I feel like I accomplished nothing.  v_v
willofd2011:	That too lol
SuperGummying:	You mean night will?
SuperGummying:	Cya
Aqua033:	Good

regal swan:	my bodys done bye peeps
Aqua033:	When she says she's into League
Aqua033:	
willofd2011:	Can I has photoshopped cookies please? Lol
SuperGummying:	I want to photoshop some
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Unless you want me to photoshop some cookies, then I've got you covered
KingofZeal:	Probably because my baking and cooking skills are sadly very lacking
willofd2011:	Homemade cookies are the best ^w^
KingofZeal:	I do like when people make cookies
willofd2011:	Doesn't mean that I can't make more tho lol
superheronerd:	Perpetual cookies
willofd2011:	True lol
KingofZeal:	You have to run out eventually
willofd2011:	That's...a good question lol
SuperGummying:	I am insane
KingofZeal:	How many cookies do you have
superheronerd:	Hey, thank you Eyan. That's really nice of you.
willofd2011:	*gives everyone even more cookies*
KingofZeal:	Granted, that may come with a small risk of also becoming insane
KingofZeal:	Well, despite how insane I am, I do extend my offer of being here to talk to Bella if you ever need it.
SuperGummying:	I feel idk something
willofd2011:	*gives eyan more cookies*
superheronerd:	I dunno. Just feeling really disconnected from something lately, but that's another story 👍🏼
KingofZeal:	I've also been staring at the rules and regulations document for far too long tonight
SuperGummying:	*takes it from eyan*
KingofZeal:	All I have going for me is my horrible sense of humor, DON'T TAKE THIS FROM ME
KingofZeal:	I'm dead on the inside Will
SuperGummying:	I talked to myself as well
willofd2011:	O.o
KingofZeal:	I talk to myself for hours on end several nights a week to people who just want me for my body, er, or something like that
SuperGummying:	Probably the most weird here
SuperGummying:	I'm very weird
KingofZeal:	eh, you can't be anymore weird than me
superheronerd:	We're all weird. But I was thinking more of myself
willofd2011:	I'd go with the former lol
KingofZeal:	That we're all weird in our own way or that that loser Eyan is really weird
SuperGummying:	Yeah everyone is weird
superheronerd:	I've been thinking about that today.
willofd2011:	Aren't we all weird in our own way tho? Lol
SuperGummying:	Now we really can't be friends Bella <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	Weird isn't always bad, as I too consider myself weird
superheronerd:	Fave pizza topping 🤙
superheronerd:	*basks in my apparent weirdness*
Aqua033:	At least we're not dipping it in milk
SuperGummying:	We can't be friends now
SuperGummying:	Well Bella we been friends for a long time and you never told me that....
Aqua033:	Eh, pineapple's alright
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Those people are weird
willofd2011:	I'm starting to feel hungry now
KingofZeal:	I love pineapple, just not on pizza
superheronerd:	Dude I love pineapple

SuperGummying:	Not too fond of it
Aqua033:	Hi hungry
SuperGummying:	Pineapple
KingofZeal:	Now I'm hungry

superheronerd:	I think I just had sugar too fast too soon today
regal swan:	pineapples
regal swan:	can i just call peehats spinning dishwasher pineaplles from now on?
SuperGummying:	Because I swear everyone always tells me that
SuperGummying:	Does everyone tell me that?
regal swan:	no sour cream and chedder ruffles are best
KingofZeal:	Ah yes, the dentist, a place where I wasted far too many hours in when I was younger v_v
SuperGummying:	I want some
SuperGummying:	Salt n vinegar potato chips
regal swan:	i need to go to dentist before i eat a lot of sugar. i miss candy 😦
SuperGummying:	Potato chips!
willofd2011:	Mhm
KingofZeal:	I do also quite enjoy salt, just not on cookies
SuperGummying:	I wonder if salt on cookies is better 🤔
SuperGummying:	Salt is better
willofd2011:	^
KingofZeal:	But sugar is great
superheronerd:	I regret having sugar today entirely 🙃 you guys can keep it
SuperGummying:	Best ones are chocolate chip
willofd2011:	Oh noes D:
KingofZeal:	I'd have a cookie, but my dad put all the best cookies in his lunch.  >_<
willofd2011:	*gives eyan all the cookies*
SuperGummying:	I'll watch it grow for you than
KingofZeal:	I already finished that.  v_v  It was hell
SuperGummying:	Or watch grass grow
SuperGummying:	I could cut grass for you
SuperGummying:	You need help?
KingofZeal:	There's just so much that needs done, and so little time v_v
superheronerd:	Having some trouble there?
SuperGummying:	Because it is?
KingofZeal:	WHY DOES MY LIFE HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT
willofd2011:	XD
SuperGummying:	Tbh you would probably get them up
SuperGummying:	They are already low
superheronerd:	To absolutely destroy your accounts win rates? Heck yeah
SuperGummying:	You can play ahri this time lol
SuperGummying:	Want my account again?
SuperGummying:	Oh yeah
superheronerd:	It was a long time ago.
SuperGummying:	It just pop in my head

SuperGummying:	No your not
superheronerd:	I'm dumb
superheronerd:	Hah
superheronerd:	Ohhh
SuperGummying:	Remember that time?
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	I told chuck I quit league and he caught me so I pretended to say it was you
SuperGummying:	Giant birb
superheronerd:	I don't know what that is
SuperGummying:	That was funny
SuperGummying:	Hey Bella remember the time you played anivia
Aqua033:	Right now I'm just on a quest to get every champion
Aqua033:	Aniv's gonna be the first 3150 champ I get
superheronerd:	Gosh.
SuperGummying:	Maybe 500
SuperGummying:	Anivia I think I played 400 games with her
Aqua033:	Except he prob couldn't even play Aniv well
Aqua033:	My brother was sorta the same way
Aqua033:	I'm just trying to diversify my champ pool
SuperGummying:	Can't play anything well besides anivia
Aqua033:	I never ~~hold back~~ quit
SuperGummying:	I'm a one trick pony at this point
SuperGummying:	My goal is to quit
Aqua033:	And Gold by the end of the season
Aqua033:	My goal's to get to Silver by the end of May
SuperGummying:	Thanks Bella
Aqua033:	My brother played for a good 5 years and only got to B3
superheronerd:	Considering I don't play, both of you are doing great haha
SuperGummying:	Also currently burnt out from league
Aqua033:	Eh, I'm doin better than my brother ever did

Aqua033:	I started playing in July
SuperGummying:	Wait you don't have the 1350 champs?
SuperGummying:	Weird
Aqua033:	Odd.
Aqua033:

SuperGummying:	And?
Aqua033:	I was trying to put a picture of every 1350IP champion I need, and Akali

Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm working the night shift, that's why I'm up so late
Aqua033:	I really got carried

Aqua033:	Well, we won
Aqua033:	I am screwing everything up so hard rn
SuperGummying:	Yay 43

Master9000:	you dont stay in peace
SuperGummying:	Shake?
SuperGummying:	Yeah I do
Master9000:	you dont come in peace
SuperGummying:	And master why attack me when I come in peace?
Dragonite:	i just need to animate this damned butterfly first
SuperGummying:	I never sleep
Master9000:	same
Dragonite:	weird right?
Dragonite:	what we have here is a situation where i may decide to go to sleep before Ida
Master9000:	then i thrown knives
SuperGummying:	What if I sneak pass the crossbows and enter the house?
SuperGummying:	Can I ask a question master?
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> any last second questions before i go to sleep?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yay, I was MVP for a round of thresh hooks!
Aqua033:	I'm gonna do one more, so that I can innevitably get salty and get calmed down by Monogatari
Aqua033:	Holy shit that was a good game
SuperGummying:	Gee wonder who gave you that name
SuperGummying:	Hi strike
Strike:	test dummy ready!
Mee6:	<@263474950181093396> is no longer 🙊  here! He/she can speak 🐵 now!
Master9000:	!unmute <@263474950181093396>
Aqua033:	I mean, I'm against a full AP Maokai
Master9000:	nice
Aqua033:	10/3/3 at the 19 minute mark
Aqua033:	This is exactly the game I needed to end the night
SuperGummying:	Cook now
Kireina:	I'm too lazy to cook tonight z_z
Kireina:	Cause I'd invite gummy if he gonna conquer the kitchen and cook
Dragonite:	./nick Spatula
Kireina:	But does he cook
SuperGummying:	Dragonite is a spatula
Dragonite:	that sounds like something i'd do though
Master9000:	youre gonna try to conquer the kitchen with a spatula
SuperGummying:	But it's a friendly visit
Master9000:	those include crossbows mounted at the doorway
SuperGummying:	We can hang out all day
SuperGummying:	I'm coming to visit
SuperGummying:	Good
Master9000:	dont worry gummy i just always take precautions
SuperGummying:	Calm down it's not you
SuperGummying:	Master
Master9000:	*uses firefox focus for everything from now on because that scrambles your IP*
Dragonite:	no
SuperGummying:	Good Dragonite I need your help
Dragonite:	no, but almost
SuperGummying:	A certain house I been tracking for?
SuperGummying:	Like find a house?
Dragonite:	you can do a lot with an ip address
SuperGummying:	I'm not going to attack unless I hate you
Aqua033:	I'm up against a full AP Maokai top
SuperGummying:	So what if I know where you live?
SuperGummying:	Shhhh
Master9000:	yeah true lmao
Aqua033:	This is the exact game I needed to wind down holy shit
Master9000:	i dont recommend using strike because gummy will be able to see your IP address if u try that lol
KingofZeal:	Nah, too much work, that's what you're for, lol
Master9000:	i recommend making a secondary account
KingofZeal:	Might need to do some testing with my timeout role then
Master9000:	and ofc admins override all permissions and can do wht they want
Master9000:	its a weird part of the algorithm that took a while to figure out
KingofZeal:	I see
Master9000:	and vice versa
Master9000:	i can do both
Master9000:	so if i have one role saying i can manage server and a lower role saying i cant do that but can manage messages
KingofZeal:	So if your role is lower, I wonder if the higher role takes effect
Master9000:	it takes all the permisison from all of your roles
KingofZeal:	Hmm, but your role is higher than the mammon machine
Mee6:	<@263474950181093396> is now 🙊here!
Master9000:	!mute <@263474950181093396>
Master9000:	!mute strike
Master9000:	you can just to !mute to prevent someone for talking in a certain channel if thats what you were thinking of doing
Master9000:	but
Master9000:	and disabling voice activity is just an annoying popup that doesnt do anything if you already cant speak
Master9000:	adding mammon machine allowed me to speak
Master9000:	gurus arent allowed to talk or use voice activity in music
KingofZeal:	I see
Master9000:	yeah thats precisely what i tested
Master9000:	so basically it combines all of your highest permissions
KingofZeal:	Hmm, wonder if you had two roles and the specific channel said one role could and one role couldn't
Dragonite:	that's one way to do it
Master9000:	tested by adding mammon machine to myself allowed me to talk
Master9000:	ok so if one role allows it theyre all allowed
Master9000:	let me try that out
KingofZeal:	Btw, if you have two roles, and one permits you to do something and another prohibts you to do something, which takes effect, the higher one I assume?
KingofZeal:	Oh, I got my answer
Dragonite:	reordering them iirc
KingofZeal:	There was something I wanted to know about channels?
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you are a dog
Dragonite:	who disobeys gravity
Dragonite:	by that logic i should be a cat
SuperGummying:	Those profile pics always misleads me
SuperGummying:	I thought aqua was a girl
Master9000:	oh right so what did u want to know about the channels eyan?
Aqua033:	It's a surprisingly common mistake
Aqua033:	All good
Master9000:	lmao derp
Aqua033:	Also, yeah I'm a guy
Aqua033:	No, I can't
Master9000:	mb
KingofZeal:	lol, 99% sure he's not
Master9000:	no idea tbh
Master9000:	uhh
KingofZeal:	Aqua's a girl?
Master9000:	he was talking for me i think
KingofZeal:	Cause that shouldn't be possible
KingofZeal:	You can too Aqua?
Master9000:	yes
Aqua033:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	Here that is
KingofZeal:	Question, are you specifically able to reorder the channels
KingofZeal:	Realmaster
Master9000:	there we go
Master9000:	sounds good
Master9000:	oh right you set the message as well derp
KingofZeal:	I hope to not need the things I'm putting in place, but I want to make sure that the precendent is in place should we need them in the future
Master9000:	something like that
Tatsumaki:	❎  |  **Master9000**, the correct usage is:  `t!remindme <reminder> in <[0 days] [00 hours] [00 minutes]> | remove | list`
▫  |  e.g. `t!remindme to get dailies in 1 day 2 hours and 32 minutes`
▫  |  Get more help using `t!help remindme`
Master9000:	t!remindme in 2 minutes
KingofZeal:	k
Tatsumaki:	❎  |  **Master9000**, the correct usage is:  `t!remindme <reminder> in <[0 days] [00 hours] [00 minutes]> | remove | list`
▫  |  e.g. `t!remindme list`
▫  |  Get more help using `t!help remindme`
Master9000:	t!remind add 2 minutes
Master9000:	theres hopefully not gonna b all that much use for it anyway
KingofZeal:	How does one set a reminder
Master9000:	we can manually do it and just set reminders in the palace
Master9000:	i didnt find anything to make it happen
KingofZeal:	Aka, for like 2 days or 10 hours or something like that
KingofZeal:	Is it possible to assign a role for a set amount of time
KingofZeal:	Also, my question to you that I asked the other day and I'll ask again
Aqua033:	Alright
KingofZeal:	Everything here will probably be renamed throughout the night as I organize shit
Master9000:	the holy book
KingofZeal:	I'm writing up what will be the equivilant of the "rules" channel
KingofZeal:	That's all I needed
Aqua033:	The other issue is, I'm really pretty new to the game, so I don't have enough champions to be able to try out everything
KingofZeal:	kkthx
Master9000:	ill dm u the link
Master9000:	that would be mee6
KingofZeal:	Also <@!162952008712716288> which bot determines the role based leveling
SuperGummying:	Im a one trick pony
Divexz:	Play around with different styles
KingofZeal:	I call myself a "few" trick, but I consistantly rotate what my tricks are based on what I'm feeling.  Confidence plays a huge role in your own performance
Aqua033:	I shifted to Sion, had a really fun time with that, came back to Fiora for a few games, and I'm preforming much better
Aqua033:	Yeah, that's what I did for a bit with Fiora
KingofZeal:	When you're struggling with a champion, sometimes it's worth just going and trying something else for a while
Aqua033:	No, I just got way, way too greedy with him
Divexz:	I would take that as a sign that either you're out of practice or malpractice
Aqua033:	Now I've just moved back onto playing top/support
Aqua033:	But over time that faded away into just another champion I'm really, really bad at
Aqua033:	I used to run a damn good Kha'Zix
Aqua033:	I really can't play anyone well in it, but I really like it
Aqua033:	That's kinda how I feel with jungle rn tbh
Deci:	had a group of camille games recently where I was seriuosly discouraged from playing her at all
Aqua033:	He did end up giving me several tips that did help, though
Deci:	it happens
Deci:	I do that sometimes as well. I had 4-5 games in a row as irelia once wher i was 1/6 or worse
Aqua033:	That bad
Aqua033:	0/10
Aqua033:	Like
Deci:	I play camille and jhin, both have 48%> winrates
Aqua033:	I mean, it was consistently really, really bad, to be fair
willofd2011:	Mhm
Deci:	don't listen to people who tell you to stop playing your main just because of a set of bad games
Aqua033:	My diamond friend told me to switch off of her because I wasn't doing well on her for a while, but I've been doing pretty well on her lately
Deci:	Well, I'm more of a camille main now, but fiora is my #2 atm
Aqua033:	Well, kinda.
Aqua033:	Yeah
Deci:	You're a fiora main like me,right?
Aqua033:	That was a 4v5 because my duoqueue partner gets really sad really easily and left pretty quick
Aqua033:	That Fiora game earlier where I went 21/8?
Aqua033:	And the one person in my ELO who I can queue with me gets the same way, only worse
Aqua033:	I just end up feeling like shit when I duo with people better than me
Divexz:	no better teacher than experiance. Just keep playing, watch the pros, try new things out
Aqua033:	In norms? Surrender.
In ranked? Don't surrender.
Aqua033:	So I have no basis of where I should start
Divexz:	keep going
Aqua033:	Their advice is usually along the lines of "git gud"
Divexz:	never surrender
Aqua033:	I just end up losing and feeling dejected
Aqua033:	I've tried
Aqua033:	Diamond friends, plat friends, gold friends
Master9000:	play with them for even more practice
Master9000:	thats good tho
Aqua033:	All my friends are way better than me
Aqua033:	I don't have any duoqueue partners
Master9000:	and soloq people typically dont have brain cells taht function properly
Neon Strike Kitty:	The hextech thing is very recent
Aqua033:	Since July.
Neon Strike Kitty:	You've not been playing long, I guess
Aqua033:	That fucking crushed my soul.
Aqua033:	I was, what, level 5?
Aqua033:	I remember a time where I almost dropped League because this person was bringing me to tears. I was Ashe, I had Queen Ashe because of the Hextech they give you at 5, I wasn't doing great, and he said something along the lines of "Are you already spending money on this game? If so, you can go die, because you're so bad and you'll never be good."
Divexz:	either you are speaking correctly or you are in denial
Master9000:	thats why u gotta duo queue
Aqua033:	When I started, I had people be so incredibly shitty to me
willofd2011:	Lol
Aqua033:	Believe me, it gets better once you level
Divexz:	get in tune with your inner self
Divexz:	drop the cancer from your life and play some single player
Aqua033:	I feel like I'm the only one who actually understands what to do against Fiora.
Aqua033:	I really, really hate ranked.
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	its silent anyway lol
willofd2011:	*sneaks into voice chat* lol
Divexz:	you can do it
Master9000:	good luck
Deino Mite:	i might come back if i can get my ipad into my room
regal swan:	night deino
Master9000:	10 more mins
Deino Mite:	i need to get some sleep so even though this discussion is very interesting and i would like to continue, i shall now take my leave
Master9000:	the way they explained it in the 20th century
Master9000:	two scorpions in a bottle, if one choses to sting the other, they both end up dead
cadance:	yep, that was the concept that prevent the cold war from going hot
Deino Mite:	if  terrorist organization ever got nukes, the human race would be screwed
Divexz:	Mutually Assured Destruction
Divexz:	MAD
Master9000:	yeah all it really does is leave humanity even more exposed to a suicidal terrorist org fucking everything up
Dragonite:	except they would probably be decided by hacking
cadance:	yes but it also helps to keep humanity in check, because nobody wants the entire race destroyed and everyone knows that's what would happen in a nuclear war
Deino Mite:	thats actually a good idea
Dragonite:	video game wars would be something else
Master9000:	i would just make all combat settled in a one on one arena where the fighters agree upon a method of combat be it archery, video games, or some form of craft
Deino Mite:	but by nukes existing, it creates the possibility of a terrible end for humanity
Dragonite:	_flings a musket at Gummy's face_
SuperGummying:	We need muskets
Dragonite:	and the Cuban Missile Crisis
SuperGummying:	No I'll bring back muskets
cadance:	the point of nukes isn't to make war, but to prevent war, look at the end of the Cold War
Deino Mite:	plus, swords and bows and axes are cool
Deino Mite:	id like to try and bring warfare back to a medieval style cus there was less mass destruction
Neon Strike Kitty:	Wow, I was tabbed out
Master9000:	and gone again in an instant
regal swan:	i would rule the world and make everyone worship numel. cause how can u hate nume?
SuperGummying:	If I conquer the world bayonets will be back
Master9000:	nukes dont do good at all
Deino Mite:	if i did conquer the world, i would eliminate nuclear weapons and warfare. nukes do more harm than good
Divexz:	yeah I totally want to get steam rolled
SuperGummying:	The place where the French Empire was strong?
Master9000:	the place that got raped by the nazis gummy?
SuperGummying:	France
Master9000:	nuketown <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Divexz:	very well, I shall play as japan
Deino Mite:	Japan
Divexz:	pick a country
SuperGummying:	Im going to use nano fibre wings
Divexz:	I feel like playing HOI4
Divexz:	speaking of WW2
SuperGummying:	No not a musket
SuperGummying:	*evil laugh*
Master9000:	a one shot per minute musket wont be able to kill 7 billion people gummy
SuperGummying:	Oh please im going to tear this world....apart
Deino Mite:	your government wouldnt last. in order to rule the world, you need to actually care about the people and have a large majority agree with you so that the entire human race doesnt rebel.
SuperGummying:	Those two are my buffer zones
Master9000:	put down in under 2 weeks
SuperGummying:	And The Grand Duchy of the Gum
SuperGummying:	The Confederation of the Gum
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
Deino Mite:	did you see how that turned out after WW1
SuperGummying:	I need buffers
SuperGummying:	Hmm buffer zones
Master9000:	not enough
Deino Mite:	it would end in disaster
SuperGummying:	Kinda
SuperGummying:	I care
Deino Mite:	you dont care about humanity's well being
Master9000:	im on deino's side for this one
superheronerd:	I read the entirety of the hunger games
Deino Mite:	that is why i dont want you to conquer the world gummy
Deino Mite:	i would rule the world, but i would have the best interest of the human species in mind
SuperGummying:	It will just be like the Soviet Union or French Empire
Divexz:	🎵 I used to ruuuulllle the woorrrllllddddd🎵
Master9000:	no shit lmao
Master9000:	sounds mongolian <@191299047896776704>
SuperGummying:	In my empire I rule the world
Deino Mite:	in my empire, i force everyone to join it. you can keep local government for the most part, but i will also have a bunch of global laws that you have to abide by. if anyone doesnt join, there are a couple things i can do. i can say that the goal of my empire is peace and if a government isnt joining, then they arent thinking of what's best for their people so the people can overthrow the government. i can also just get a strong enough army and force them into submission cus i would have a foothold in a large part of the world
Master9000:	hi shaco
Divexz:	not really appealing to me
Divexz:	neither have I
Master9000:	i havent read the hunger games lol
Deino Mite:	yep
cadance:	so what master wants is the hunger games, but slightly different Kappa
Master9000:	everyone starts off in the best area but when they do stuff agaisnt the rules of that area they are kicked from it and are limited to only sections in which they have not broken rules in
Deino Mite:	but the UN doesnt force people to join it
Deino Mite:	but if i do that, then people in the different sectors will fight with each other
cadance:	i mean isn't that pretty much what the UN's police force is for? and look how effective that is
Master9000:	divide the world into sectors where people can live under certain sets of laws
Deino Mite:	ya small scale wars are a problem
Deino Mite:	do you have a better solution?
Divexz:	oh rip
Master9000:	seems good in theory but in application you get small scale star wars
Aqua033:	
Divexz:	flawless
Divexz:	solve violence with violence
Deino Mite:	id need to make an imperial army that i would use to threaten anyone that goes to way. if two groups start fighting, my imperial army will go snuff out both sides
Divexz:	one of the same
Master9000:	did you say dankest timeline? <@127474202520453120>
Dragonite:	_replaces Eyan with Penelope_
Divexz:	We truely live in the greatest timeline
Deino Mite:	and ive thought about the best way to achieve world peace, and conquering the world and making everyone get along is the best thing i came up with
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
Neon Strike Kitty:	*slowly replaces important people with cats*
Master9000:	is self destructive
Aqua033:	Really meh
Neon Strike Kitty:	How do I put this......
Neon Strike Kitty:	But humanity's kind of
Deino Mite:	then they arent people
Deino Mite:	i dont want to get take away people's humanity though
Divexz:	done
Divexz:	replace everyone with robots
Divexz:	simple solution
Deino Mite:	ya human corruption is a problem
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've noticed I'm an awful Rakan when I have 800 ping to deal with
cadance:	though if i get auto'd to support i'm a good rakan
Neon Strike Kitty:	and throw some cc at the enemy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I mostly feed lately
Divexz:	would you call that world a utopia or a dystopia
Master9000:	i would support your cause but human greed and corruption would corrupt this bureaucracy even if you managed to set up and sustain such a thing
cadance:	i mostly do renekton and xayah top lately
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **cadance leveled up!**
cadance:	but i suppose to answer your question, yes
Neon Strike Kitty:	ROBOT ARMY
cadance:	i've been doing a lot of different things
Deino Mite:	the nazis were fascist though. my ultimate goal is to create a world where everyone, or at least as much of the world as possible, gets along. id like to do it peacefully, but if i need to use military means to achieve world peace, i will
Master9000:	cadance youre mostly a top laner right?
cadance:	the desire to carry myself back to gold again is there but the motivation to deal with the shitfest isn't
Divexz:	solo queing helps no one
Divexz:	If you really care about succeding, go play with a party
Master9000:	sounds about right
cadance:	when you do the most damage in the entire game, kill every tower that your team took, have the highest cs, you'll still get called shit when your team loses because they chose to walk into jungle with no vision and get caught in a 5v4 agaisnt a team with really good aoe cc
Divexz:	I'm not ranked but I'm pretty sure I'd end up in a rank below bronze
Master9000:	remember kids no matter where you are youre in elo hell
cadance:	don't worry aqua, silver is worse
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Divexz:	thus there would be living space for the germans
Divexz:	Conquering russia
Aqua033:	>Goes into ranked
>First game, we have a Kassadin that dies 12 times and calls everyone else shit
This is how bronze is.
Master9000:	and what did that involve
Divexz:	they wanted a truely german state
Master9000:	deino thats what they wanted to their method just involved killing groups they wrongly thought would harm that
Divexz:	I'm reading through Mein Kampf. The nazi's wanted labensraum
cadance:	ah so hunger games then
Deino Mite:	i dont care who you are. just no fighting with other people
SuperGummying:	Best war was Napoleonic wars
Deino Mite:	i want to make it so people stop fighting
Master9000:	it is tho
Deino Mite:	they wanted a master race
Divexz:	Gandhi being non violent was the only option to prevent nuclear anihalation
Deino Mite:	no
Master9000:	<:Ironic:307345212328509442>
cadance:	isn't that what the nazi's wanted?
Deino Mite:	I'm going to create a time of world peace by conquering the world
Divexz:	give him nukes however
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gandhi went peaceful because they didn't have weapons
Master9000:	even gandhi got shot
Divexz:	There's even a book called the art of war by sun tzu
regal swan:	same thing with spanish class the teacher didnt care
cadance:	peace even
Master9000:	yeah, shit
cadance:	even during times of piece
cadance:	there is always a war of some sort
cadance:	there's no such thing as a lack of war in human society
Master9000:	from my point of view the lack of war is the best war
Divexz:	Best war
Master9000:	lmao
Divexz:	American revolution
cadance:	literally skipped the final and got a b
cadance:	i passed ap us history without doing anything
SuperGummying:	I was there
SuperGummying:	The Napoleonic Wars
SuperGummying:	Ah war
superheronerd:	I've heard the war stories.
Dragonite:	(ノಠДಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
Dragonite:	i didnt even sign up for the class and they put me in it anyway
Dragonite:	a lot
Dragonite:	ap us history sucked
superheronerd:	Also, kind of envious
superheronerd:	Good luck.
Master9000:	im doing apush next year
superheronerd:	I think their biggest complaint was ap euro
Master9000:	and that reminds me of the time dunko beat ski in that one game
Master9000:	that reminds me of the ap exam for it in 3 days
Master9000:	this reminds me of ap world
superheronerd:	I'm pretty familiar with ap. Nearly all my friends were in it
Master9000:	im only going into ap beceause of its implication in engineering
superheronerd:	Pretty awesome to me
superheronerd:	The math to it.
Master9000:	you live in physics
superheronerd:	_understand physics_
Dragonite:	do what
superheronerd:	How do you people do it
Dragonite:	( :
Dragonite:	> "imaginary surface"
Master9000:	tbh i would probably like it
Master9000:	sounds fun already
Master9000:	WAHOOOOOOOOOOOO
Divexz:	it's an imaginary surface used to determine electric flux
Master9000:	gaussian surface?
Divexz:	"Here's an electrically charged slab with a gaussian surface embedded into it. Good fucking luck figuring this shit out"
Divexz:	E&M free response questions
Master9000:	what was the hardest part?
Divexz:	it was super brutal
Divexz:	I wanted to walk out today in the middle of that test
Master9000:	thats 2 years away tho
Master9000:	thats the one i actually care for lol
Divexz:	oh boy was I not prepared
Divexz:	AP Physics C on the other hand
Master9000:	the global 2 exam we pretend like it doesnt even exist because its taht easy compared to the new ap exam they just made starting this year
Divexz:	the test wasn't that bad
Divexz:	I remember AP World History
Master9000:	and college board is for profit
Deino Mite:	thats nice of him
Master9000:	this exam costs $84 per person taking it
Master9000:	amd yeah dude
Master9000:	we got to crash a server
Master9000:	it was fun
Deino Mite:	so some teacher made that kahoot to help people across the country study
Master9000:	and this was announced to thousands of people in each state
Master9000:	http://www.freeman-pedia.com/ap-world-kahoot/ the AP exam is thursday
Deino Mite:	why are there so many people on that kahoot?
Master9000:	lmfao
Master9000:	oh wow this exists
Master9000:	took too long to answer
Master9000:	wrong
SuperGummying:	The French
SuperGummying:	French
Master9000:	<@199725993416589313>
Master9000:	blue and yellow
Neon Strike Kitty:	Feeling slightly less tilted
Master9000:	ok try this
Master9000:	theyre all correct answers too
Neon Strike Kitty:	Now I'm tilted
Master9000:	lmfao
Master9000:	lmao marx is even red
SuperGummying:	The Ottoman Empire
SuperGummying:	Oh my
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	moustache game op
Master9000:	lmao people are tuning out by the hundreds
Kireina:	lol
Master9000:	too many people
Master9000:	lmfao the host is getting kicked from the server
Master9000:	
Aqua033:	I know
Master9000:	theres about 2k people answering
Master9000:	lmao look at the number of people watching
Aqua033:	Yellow, because I'm lazy.
Aqua033:	Hmm
Master9000:	i went with blue
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yellow
Master9000:	yup
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, anyone feel like doing normals?
Luckyskarm:	but `t!urban {name}` is the best command tbh
Luckyskarm:	i never got hackerman
Master9000:	8 on <#305548986155008000>
Master9000:	then again look at this
Master9000:	tatsu should really have that be automatic
Luckyskarm:	`t@prune Trashy memes`
Rainy:	I used to like it, then I realized that I had the capability to ignore politics entirely
Neon Strike Kitty:	*this was on a smurf account*
Neon Strike Kitty:	still managed to win somehow
Neon Strike Kitty:	I went like 0/11/8 in a game this morning
Rainy:	Yeah LWT, get your head in the game, get those trash memes outta here.
Rainy:	Honestly, after the tank update, Mao'kai and Zac just feel like better supports than anything.
Master9000:	you know i like last week tonight but they use such stale memes
Aqua033:	Pfft
Rainy:	Classic Articuno
Aqua033:	That's Anivia
Aqua033:	You know that picture where there's the Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur, and one person's asking what Venusaur's doing, and another person said "his best"
Neon Strike Kitty:	it was a pretty good game
Neon Strike Kitty:	I supported Gummy once when he played Cait
Aqua033:	Like
Aqua033:	Maokai set some good stuff up, and Anivia tried
Rainy:	Cait is the only ADC I can play at a decent level, so this is... Comical
Rainy:	Seems like that kinda person
Rainy:	I guessed as much looking at what she hes
Aqua033:	She built BT first.
Aqua033:	Worst part is?
Rainy:	That cait build gave me eye cancer
Aqua033:	Anivia, Maokai, and I were actually trying to play the game.
Aqua033:	But yeah, Cait was blaming Maokai for not peeling, as well as Pantheon for feeding, and Pantheon was blaming Cait for feeding.
Aqua033:	Obvs
Rainy:	Obviously being right
Rainy:	What's more important: Being right or winning?
Aqua033:	Ah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm mostly commenting on the enemy Rakan
Aqua033:	Actually playing the game
Aqua033:	Instead of, you know
Aqua033:	They just kept arguing the entire game about whose fault it was.
Aqua033:	The issues were Pantheon and Caitlyn.
Aqua033:	No, Maokai was honestly fine.
Master9000:	looks like an ap maokai to throw the game for ya lol
Rainy:	Why tho
Rainy:	Wait, Panth built yellow jungle item?
Aqua033:	But Pantheon was just so god damn toxic
Aqua033:	Cait *was* kinda trash
Neon Strike Kitty:	well, neither botlane
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seems like it's not a very good botlane
Aqua033:	This was the rest of the team
Aqua033:	:3
Aqua033:	Y tho
Rainy:	Shoulda built six phantom dancers
Rainy:	RIP
Aqua033:	Ow, my back
Rainy:	Seriously, this hail cut up my window screen. It's some bad juju
Rainy:	I love snow, just not this variety
SuperGummying:	Snow is no fun
Rainy:	And it will kill progressively less small and less young children until it kills me.
Rainy:	Well the snow just killed a small child
Neon Strike Kitty:	💃
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's called snow
SuperGummying:	I see well can't help you there
Rainy:	I'm not learned in this subject
Rainy:	Possibly due to the wrath of some sort of elder god, I am uncertain.
SuperGummying:	And why is it falling from the sky?
Rainy:	No, like those half elliptical ice shaped blocks you get from your fridge's ice machine
SuperGummying:	Hail?
SuperGummying:	Er I mean that sucks
SuperGummying:	Lol
Rainy:	Guys I think I'm going to die. Ice is falling from the sky
SuperGummying:	Let me pm
Master9000:	sup
SuperGummying:	Master I have a question
Pogi:	Man, Pittsburgh is weird
Master9000:	eyan youre 4 hours away and somehow i never hear any of this shit <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
SuperGummying:	Yup they do
KingofZeal:	Can't say I've used the phrase mow the lawn much in my lifetime if at all.  Keep in mind I'm from Pittsburgh though, Pittsburghers say all sorts of weird shit.
Zaranius:	Him and Phantom Blaster Diablo work amazingly together
Neon Strike Kitty:	I like the look of that one
Zaranius:	<@!141255588846895105> this is my main card in my deck
Zaranius:	these explain the rules
Zaranius:	http://cardfight.wikia.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules
Zaranius:	one sec
Zaranius:	Pretty much the main card is the vanguard and you need to make sure it it does not take 6 damage
Neon Strike Kitty:	What's it like?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've never heard of that
Zaranius:	Cardfight Vanguard
Zaranius:	nope not YGO
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's not a YGO card, is it? Or is it?
Zaranius:	Dark Dragon, Phantom Blaster "Diablo"
Neon Strike Kitty:	What card is that?
Zaranius:	I love this card so much
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm actually not good enough to beat Touhou on easy
Master9000:	gonna check what some colors on it look like
Master9000:	but first
Master9000:	i have no idea what i built but im gonna 3d print it
regal swan:	looks really cool
Master9000:	look at the views in <#305548986155008000>
regal swan:	looks good to me
Master9000:	too much?
Dragonite:	i say both
Deino Mite:	i cant believe there are actually people that say cut the grass
Deino Mite:	one of my classes was looking at dialect tests and one them asked if you saw cut/mow the lawn/grass and everyone in my class said mow the lawn
Deino Mite:	everyone i knew says mow the lawn
Deino Mite:	thats so weird
Deino Mite:	you say cut the grass?
KingofZeal:	Something like that
regal swan:	have fun?
Master9000:	its too wet to cut grass here still
KingofZeal:	Anyways, I'm afk, gotta go cut the grass, screw spring, blasted allergies, and fast growing grass v_v
Master9000:	thought so
KingofZeal:	Everywhere
SuperGummying:	That's me 😜
SuperGummying:	See guys my other account ^
regal swan:	swans i dunno
Master9000:	hey eyan where should i add bevels to this thing lol
KingofZeal:	Granted, the satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment when succeeding makes it all worth it to me
SuperGummying:	I think I rage quit when I played it once
KingofZeal:	It's takes a certain kind of person who likes pain and suffering to play Touhou
KingofZeal:	Well that's why they aren't for everyone.  😛
superheronerd:	Sounds rough tho
Aqua033:	Mainly from Eyan, but I've heard of it.
Aqua033:	I have
Kugallyblitz:	I've never even heard of Touhou
Master9000:	does anyone want me to build them something?
Master9000:	since i have the thing open
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	Ew math
Master9000:	the circle and diagonal line are supposed to touch
Master9000:	wow i did that fast
SuperGummying:	Touhou isn't something for me either
superheronerd:	I wouldn't mind watching them though
KingofZeal:	Bullet hell games definitely aren't for everyone and I can easily respect that opinion
SuperGummying:	Why 100?
superheronerd:	I can't get behind bullet hell games
Master9000:	no gummy we need 100 viewers or something for tetris
willofd2011:	@Master9000 same
SuperGummying:	What about Tetris? That could be another one
SuperGummying:	Seems fun
Master9000:	i feel like you did that before a long time ago
SuperGummying:	Oh I see
KingofZeal:	Touhou can just be paused and unpaused at will
KingofZeal:	HS games can easily take longer than the length of getting between games
KingofZeal:	I don't consider it one
SuperGummying:	Wouldn't hearthstone also be an "in-queue" game?
KingofZeal:	I want it to be an "in-queue" game when playing League
KingofZeal:	I'll probably showcase some Touhou in the upcoming streams
willofd2011:	Looks fun tho lol
willofd2011:	I've never played touhou before lol
Master9000:	now time to prove to my teacher that the problem from today was impossible
Master9000:	ok added inventor to list of playing programs
Dragonite:	but was too lazy
Dragonite:	i thought about playingn touhou once
KingofZeal:	It's just amplified and significantly more important the harder your difficulty
KingofZeal:	I should say Touhou period is 80% patterns, 20% reaction time
KingofZeal:	Touhou on harder difficulties is about 80% patterns, and 20% reaction time, but reaction time is still insanely important cause that 20% will make or break you
Master9000:	is it more about patterns or reaction time?
KingofZeal:	Where as most people could beat hard mode Momodora eventually given enough time
KingofZeal:	There are people who in this world who probably couldn't beat Lunatic Touhou if they were locked in a room for a year and told to beat it on Lunatic
KingofZeal:	At least Lunatic Touhou
Master9000:	i just wasnt sure which was which
KingofZeal:	That game's nothing compared to Touhou though
Master9000:	yeah thats the one
Master9000:	*opens the incognito window again*
KingofZeal:	And I never streamed Castlevania, so I guess it'd have to be momodora
KingofZeal:	Not sure, sounds like Castlevania, or maybe Momodora
SuperGummying:	Very hard game
SuperGummying:	I tried touhou once
Master9000:	the other one was the game you played one time which you explored a 2d platformer with lots of rooms and a final boss at the end and you were joking about the highest difficulty everything oneshoting you and thats what it actually ended up being
KingofZeal:	Not sure what you're referring to with the latter, they're bullet hell games
Master9000:	are they the bullet hell or the 2d combat platforming ones u played on stream?
KingofZeal:	Just an FYI Ida, Touhou is not easy by any means.  They're games that take a lot of practice to get good at.  I've been playing them for years and can only beat some of them on hard.  Still have no lunatic wins under my belt.  It also depends on which game you're playing as some are harder than others.
Kugallyblitz:	whoa how did you do that Touhou thing 😮
Neon Strike Kitty:	*does a Touhou thing*
SuperGummying:	I'll switch later
SuperGummying:	Nvm
Dragonite:	\:thinking\:

Dragonite:	i forget where i was going with that
Dragonite:	don';t tell me . . .
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've been 17 years old for the past 30 years
Kugallyblitz:	wow dude no way same
Dragonite:	when i was twelve i was actually about seven
Kugallyblitz:	thats how you confuse people
Kugallyblitz:	"How old are you?" 12 "When I was your age... I was 18."
Luckyskarm:	XD
Aqua033:	Your money
regal swan:	i mean thats true lucky
Neon Strike Kitty:	When I was your age, I was younger
Luckyskarm:	~~we are all secretly 5~~
Dragonite:	that's pretty good in the grand scheme of things
Kugallyblitz:	only off by like 17 years or so
Dragonite:	well i was close, wasn't i
regal swan:	i have u know sir i am eyans age

regal swan:	i feel loved
Dragonite:	yes
regal swan:	so hes me basically dragonite?
Dragonite:	re: gummy: we assume you're serious because you say you're joking and proceed to make bad decisions anyway
Kugallyblitz:	I wake up feeling like I need extra sleep then go to bed feeling like I never need to sleep again
regal swan:	also ssry bot for language no sensor in brain rn
regal swan:	sore as sore rn
Master9000:	I wake up feeling like shit and then improve throughout the day
Luckyskarm:	wow
Luckyskarm:	Sup
Kugallyblitz:	howdy
regal swan:	hi peeps
SuperGummying:	Well I'll tone down joking for today
SuperGummying:	I see
Neon Strike Kitty:	that's probably it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because I woke up in a terrible mood
SuperGummying:	Why do you have to be serious today 😭
SuperGummying:	Yeah you always joke with me
Neon Strike Kitty:	which is kind of ironic, actually
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm way too serious, I guess
SuperGummying:	Most of the time I'm like 95% joke
SuperGummying:	Idk why do you always think I mean everything
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK now I know why people call this bullet hell
Neon Strike Kitty:	Why do you always feel the need to brag?
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's not a thing
SuperGummying:	Ida I play that on very difficult mode
SuperGummying:	No Dragonite you are not allowed to shoot me
Neon Strike Kitty:	How do people even play the higher difficulties?
Neon Strike Kitty:	This is supposed to be easy mode!
Dragonite:	_aims an ICBM at Canadaland_
SuperGummying:	Shoot me in the head
SuperGummying:	Well great clothes shopping
willofd2011:	XD
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm actually awful at this, apparnetly

Kireina:	Well Hanzo isn't a ninja technically >_>
Aqua033:	It's a command
Kugallyblitz:	like buttons devoted to that stuff lel
Neon Strike Kitty:	but we were definitely discussing Hanzo, even if I got my facts on who that is wrong
Kugallyblitz:	I feel like dragonite has a totally separate keyboard to typing those things with faces and flipping tables
Aqua033:	Handsoap
Neon Strike Kitty:	I might be confusing him with a different Hanzo
Aqua033:	Also Genji.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well I'm pretty sure he's at least a ninja
Kireina:	Hanzo is arrow bow man dude
Kireina:	you are thinking of Genji
Kireina:	I believe
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've never actually played Overwatch, but I think Hanzo was something like that
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well I think it's a robot ninja
Kireina:	so how about them robot ninjas
Kugallyblitz:	lol dragonite
Kireina:	LOL
Dragonite:	(╯°Д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)

Dragonite:	tee hee
Deino Mite:	yep
KingofZeal:	Which is pretty 10/10 in my book
KingofZeal:	With weeb characters
KingofZeal:	I've wanted to try it mainly cause from what I've seen of it, it looks like a Nintendo-esque XCom
Deino Mite:	cus FE is my favorite franchise and it would be so cool to see you play it. if you decide to and need any advice, let me know
Master9000:	shrodinger's wukong
Deino Mite:	alright
KingofZeal:	It's been something I've wanted to try for a while, just never had the time
Deino Mite:	Eyan, would you ever consider playing fire emblem on stream?
Master9000:	whew
KingofZeal:	It's not anime rm, don't worry
Master9000:	quite the opposite for me
Deino Mite:	and anything with an anime art style peaks my interest
SuperGummying:	I just realize Eyan has a touhou video on his channel
Deino Mite:	I know it has an anime art style, but ive never seen Touhou before so im excited to see it
Dragonite:	heh
Master9000:	*googles what touhou is in incognit0*
KingofZeal:	Like, it's the epitomy of what I've been theming my stream around, lol
Deino Mite:	alright
KingofZeal:	It's seasonal based
KingofZeal:	Demo came out today so probably during League queue's like I was originally planning
Master9000:	my excitement was a cosine during thta message
Deino Mite:	are you gonna stream it?
KingofZeal:	My hype levels are off the charts for the new Touhou game
Dragonite:	_'s bullskitty alarm starts beating Gummy around the head again_

SuperGummying:	And a play button
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you wouldn't get suspended you probably would get a permanent ban
Divexz:	Holy crap does league suck up a lot of my time
Dragonite:	accept his advice and have my youtube channel suspended?
Dragonite:	i mean, what am i SUPPOSED to do
Master9000:	we just have to accept that
Master9000:	aqua it never ends
SuperGummying:	All I did was offer Dragonite YouTube lessons

Neon Strike Kitty:	From you?
SuperGummying:	Ida wanna learn about war tactics and how to YouTube?
Dragonite:	to be fair i wouldnt want gummy to teach me how to YouTube either
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's like me asking you to teach me war tactics or how to YouTube
Neon Strike Kitty:	You want to learn from *me*
SuperGummying:	Teach me how to jungle
SuperGummying:	Nice
Neon Strike Kitty:	Next game was 8/10/6, so it's an improvement
SuperGummying:	Rip

Kireina:	According to sneaky
KingofZeal:	Or something or other
KingofZeal:	Somebody donated with a phone number in the message which is against twitch tos
Kireina:	might've been that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

superheronerd:	Weirdly looks pretty good
Roserade:	sushi lookin good af

Master9000:	All the sushi is gone
Master9000:	Dessert after as well
superheronerd:	How many are you going to have?
Master9000:	28 pieces down
Deino Mite:	i really like salmon
Master9000:	I don't think there's a form of salmon I don't like
superheronerd:	Cooked salmon is amazing. Raw just. Feels wrong
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's disgusting
Neon Strike Kitty:	And we have fish here *all the bloody time*
Deino Mite:	despite being an otaku, i have never actually had sushi
Master9000:	It feels so clean and uniform
superheronerd:	Cooked fish is amazing though
Master9000:	Really?
Neon Strike Kitty:	unless the cook is good
Neon Strike Kitty:	I kind of dislike all fish
superheronerd:	I tried it. The consistency is too weird for me
Master9000:	Salmon is the only fish I actually like
superheronerd:	I can't do raw fish
superheronerd:	Raw?
Master9000:	And all of it was salmon lol
Master9000:	I never told you guys the story of why it is impossible
superheronerd:	Sushi's not my thing but sounds like you had a good time
Master9000:	That won't work tho
Deino Mite:	then we have something to indoctrinate you with<:VoHiYo:310828799589744641>
Master9000:	I've liked sushi for years
Master9000:	Not really deino
superheronerd:	Nice 😁
Deino Mite:	"sushi" I see you have begun the path towards being a weeb
Master9000:	Teenage <:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Master9000:	I just ate 27 pieces of sushi roll
Aqua033:	I'm in bronze, everything is seen
Master9000:	I haven't seen an akali in so long
Aqua033:	And she ended up going 16/3.
Aqua033:	But Lux and Evelynn decided to give her two kills
Aqua033:	I was actually doing well against an Akali for once
Master9000:	Quick sell it all for an easy profit
Aqua033:	I'm a god damn salt mine rn
Aqua033:	Hoo boy
Master9000:	Gummy I just woke up like 3 hours ago

Neon Strike Kitty:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	But the internets are calling
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's easy
Master9000:	How the hell did you manage to sleep for 11 hours?
Aqua033:	How the hell am I still tired after 11 hours of sleep
LightsXBane:	Virtually even xD
Deino Mite:	now i really have to clean my room before my parents virtually skin me alive
Master9000:	Looks like cadance has you guys covered lol
Master9000:	I hate the new feature that limits to 3 notifications per channel plus mentions

KingofZeal:	If it's a twitch emote, I'm not particularly critical
KingofZeal:	It's fine by me
Deino Mite:	do you approve of vohiyo?
KingofZeal:	Talk to realmaster about emotes
Deino Mite:	i think eyan would apprive
cadance:	i'd rather have TehePolo
Deino Mite:	someone who is a mod, make vohiyo an emote
Roserade:	VoHiYo
Aqua033:	...Why does that *still* not work on mobile
Aqua033:	/shrug
Deino Mite:	why is vohiyo not an emote?
Deino Mite:	^need that now
LightsXBane:	Sagiri channel

LightsXBane:	Good luck
Aqua033:	No its not you get right back here this instant
Roserade:	spring cleaning
Deino Mite:	well, i have to clean my room so thats enough cute sagiri for now

Aqua033:	My friends are a colorful group of people
Deino Mite:	there are better ones

SuperGummying:	Give me some food today
Divexz:	There was a royalty higherarchy for the vikings
Master9000:	Yeah
SuperGummying:	Were you up till 5 yesterday
SuperGummying:	Master
Dragonite:	they had, like, "high status" people
Master9000:	Did Vikings not have any royalty?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*scared
SuperGummying:	Ida is um a type of person I'm scare of
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK, gonna go get bleach
Roserade:	because its always lit fam <:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Neon Strike Kitty:	Parties?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ghetto?
Roserade:	why do ghetto pyromanicas love parties?
Dragonite:	_burns down Schala_
Neon Strike Kitty:	Same thing, basically
Dragonite:	and a pyromaniac
Neon Strike Kitty:	it includes, among other things, arsonist
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's a long list of things I am
Roserade:	thats hotter bggLewd
Dragonite:	she's lying, she's a viking

willofd2011:	Later eyan ^w^
Kugallyblitz:	Peace eyan
KingofZeal:	Talk to you all later.   Peace
Kugallyblitz:	sounds like a plan
KingofZeal:	Gonna try to actually organize this crap
SuperGummying:	well i like it
KingofZeal:	I got what I came for
KingofZeal:	Alright
Kugallyblitz:	gotcha
KingofZeal:	The music channel specifically would be for the bot and organizing music, but sharing music would fall into creative probably
Kugallyblitz:	like music we made
Dragonite:	what is the appeal of an nsfw channel in the first place
Master9000:	theres nsfw restrictions for channels now but i dont think we want to make use of those
Kugallyblitz:	could music fall into the art category?
KingofZeal:	Creative would include pictures, art, anything else involving creativity
Master9000:	i need to be up for my birthday sushi meeting in 11 hours too lol
SuperGummying:	you know that stuff
JelloHammer:	for pictures of food/pets
SuperGummying:	food recipes
JelloHammer:	Harbleu has a channel caalled 'food_or_pets'
SuperGummying:	like food pictures
MajesticEclipse02:	why
MajesticEclipse02:	food channel ? for what
SuperGummying:	for food posting
Dragonite:	~~oh yeah and RPG of Zeal releases when~~
SuperGummying:	you should make a food channel
Dragonite:	for the time being i suppose i might as well lump game design in creative, since it technically is
Aqua033:	I'm probably gonna go to sleep, I've been up for almost 21 hours
MajesticEclipse02:	yes
Master9000:	yeah
SuperGummying:	would a creative channel be art?
KingofZeal:	The potentials aren't guarenteed yet but I'll mull them over
SuperGummying:	pokemon channel looks good
SuperGummying:	oh okay
MajesticEclipse02:	*slams head into desk*
KingofZeal:	General Convo, Pay To Talk Convo, Memes, Talk to Eyan, Online Games, Bot Channel, Music Channel, New People Channel, Announcements, Rules

Potentially a restricted channel, game of the week channel, anime channel, Pokemon channel, and creative channel

That's the list for the record gummy, memes already included
SuperGummying:	he likes gummy bears
SuperGummying:	let eyan pick
SuperGummying:	no
MajesticEclipse02:	okay
SuperGummying:	oh green
MajesticEclipse02:	what color of gummy are you
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **KingofZeal leveled up!**
KingofZeal:	I would actually be interested in such a thing Dragonite, but I don't think there's enough people to make that happen atm
SuperGummying:	?
MajesticEclipse02:	gummy what color are you ?
Aqua033:	Of course
SuperGummying:	of course you guys beat gummy to the punch line
Aqua033:	Already suggested, Gummy
Kugallyblitz:	<@!304073163669766158> I think we should let it as it is, and if something is needed we add in the future, cos it's kinda exhausting coming up with ideas not knowing if we'll need em
JelloHammer:	instead of filling up guardia with photos they can just post it in a separate channel <@!304073163669766158>
SuperGummying:	or a shitpost channel
Dragonite:	am i the only one here who likes to make games? would a gamedev channel be a waste of time?
SuperGummying:	what about a meme channel?
MajesticEclipse02:	
Master9000:	this is all text channels we've discussed right?
JelloHammer:	I thought a photo bin for people who just want to send in photos they found
SuperGummying:	um
Dragonite:	i cant think of any, no
MajesticEclipse02:	damnit dragonite
Dragonite:	:<
KingofZeal:	Any other channel ideas floating around?
Dragonite:	_chucks jello in the dungeon of zeal_
JelloHammer:	Sounds kinky <@137336478291329024>
KingofZeal:	There's also a rumored one that was never added to the game
Dragonite:	apparently that isnt it
Dragonite:	the dungeon of zeal
KingofZeal:	One in present day, one in antiquity
Dragonite:	i tried that already
SuperGummying:	night eyan
KingofZeal:	Two
superheronerd:	Goodnight
KingofZeal:	Yes
JelloHammer:	chrono trigger has a prison right?
KingofZeal:	kk, goodnight
JelloHammer:	I mean
regal swan:	i think i going  to bed guys i prob lurk tommorow
Dragonite:	that';s not chrono trigger though, jello
JelloHammer:	"NO EXCUSES, NOW GO TO YOUR CHANNEL"
Kugallyblitz:	ok, so just have common sense and you wont be put in this room
JelloHammer:	<@303048546179874816> so basically detention
MajesticEclipse02:	!!!!
MajesticEclipse02:	TREASON
MajesticEclipse02:	he found the innocent person guilty
MajesticEclipse02:	i just realised that the chancellor is evil
SuperGummying:	^
Dragonite:	wouldnt that be the same as a server kick
Kugallyblitz:	restricted channel, so if you did something inappropriate you get put in it?
Aqua033:	So, we can't just sub for a month, remove the sub, and still have access
KingofZeal:	At this point in time, it's not really super important considering subbing is still hypothetical at this point
KingofZeal:	That would likely be the case
Dragonite:	there's a link between discord and twitch so i assume so
SuperGummying:	until i resub?
SuperGummying:	pay to talk gets remove right?
SuperGummying:	so if my sub thing runs out
Kugallyblitz:	oh ok
KingofZeal:	Pay to talk is short for subs/patrons
Aqua033:	I'd imagine it'd fall under the same category, Gummy
MajesticEclipse02:	alot of channels
SuperGummying:	can we have a cartoon channel for those who don't watch anime?
willofd2011:	Ah ok lol
Kugallyblitz:	How would pay to talk go?
Dragonite:	that sounds fun too
Dragonite:	oh yeah the ama channel
Dragonite:	i said something about migrating from one voice call to another <@113084295958044672>

KingofZeal:	Okiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii SOOOOOOO
SuperGummying:	thats why we avoid playing it here
KingofZeal:	v_v
SuperGummying:	tbh we were never fighting, it was a provoking game which for you guys gets old for us never
Aqua033:	I'm actually pretty decent at stopping fights in the moment, when I'm not preoccupied
willofd2011:	I don't fight either lol
MajesticEclipse02:	**

SuperGummying:	i was winning
MajesticEclipse02:	what is this
MajesticEclipse02:	you just said not 5 minutes ago that you were winning
Aqua033:	I-I mean, whatever gets you to stop
SuperGummying:	but but hmmmm true i keep losing
Dragonite:	that was a resounding response
Kugallyblitz:	^^^
MajesticEclipse02:	^
willofd2011:	^^
Aqua033:	^
KingofZeal:	You'll save yourself a lot of time and energy just, not fighting, lol
Kugallyblitz:	I was thinking the same
MajesticEclipse02:	WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS ?!?!? WHY CAN'T WE BE FRRIIIEENNNDDSSSS
KingofZeal:	Yo, gummy
Aqua033:	Because gettin along's for scrubs
Dragonite:	did i miss something
willofd2011:	Why can't you guys just get along
MajesticEclipse02:	6-0
Aqua033:	AYE
MajesticEclipse02:	5-0
SuperGummying:	so um theres more people
Kugallyblitz:	😐
SuperGummying:	dude i still have to fight ida and master
superheronerd:	aye
MajesticEclipse02:	aye
Kugallyblitz:	AYE PLS
willofd2011:	Aye
Aqua033:	*Screams random pirate things in the background*
KingofZeal:	Aye
MajesticEclipse02:	all in favor of the gummy/dragonite fued coming to an end say aye
KingofZeal:	You could just stop fighting
KingofZeal:	ORRRRRRRRRRR
Aqua033:	Also, matey, you say?
SuperGummying:	fine we will fight in the other chat
willofd2011:	Agreed
Aqua033:	It *would* be nice if you two stopped, I'll agree
Dragonite:	we were fighitng way before that matey
MajesticEclipse02:	gummy what color of gummybear are you ?
Kugallyblitz:	LILLIE ISN'T REAL!!
SuperGummying:	and she's still mine
KingofZeal:	Channels
SuperGummying:	the only reason this started was lillie
MajesticEclipse02:	that seems one sided
MajesticEclipse02:	i can't really imagine a gummy bear f=and a dragon fighting
Master9000:	its most of the point value the two have against each other too
Kugallyblitz:	sign a peace treaty you guys
Dragonite:	welp
SuperGummying:	dragonite and me hate each other
SuperGummying:	nah it's real
KingofZeal:	If it's joking, then it stopped being funny forever ago
SuperGummying:	why
SuperGummying:	dragonite no
SuperGummying:	it's pretty chill in the voice chat
Dragonite:	<@!304073163669766158> gummy wants to know if we're joking fighting or actually fighting because i don't know if he knows himself
MajesticEclipse02:	you know because i can probably just supply popcorn while they fight
MajesticEclipse02:	or not
MajesticEclipse02:	the blessing must be bestowed
SuperGummying:	no
MajesticEclipse02:	Should we call upon the great fairy fountain ?
SuperGummying:	there was a reason i chose camelot
Kugallyblitz:	tbh I agree lol
Dragonite:	heh
KingofZeal:	Getting those two to stop fighting would be quite a blessing
SuperGummying:	nay
MajesticEclipse02:	well then
Dragonite:	because it gets boring otherwise
regal swan:	nay u heard the king on yelling/fighting
MajesticEclipse02:	why do you fight though ?
Dragonite:	all in favor of migrating the Camelot voice chat to the Zeal voice chat so i don't have to keep switching channels to yell at Gummy, say "aye"
SuperGummying:	k
Kugallyblitz:	ok, I wont be able to talk for a few but suuure
SuperGummying:	pls
SuperGummying:	come back to us
SuperGummying:	blitz
Kugallyblitz:	😐
SuperGummying:	sceptile
regal swan:	any suggestions for my oras team? current perma team is zangoose,camperaut,sceptile,crawnduant, and lairon
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ
MajesticEclipse02:	actually no...... a ceiling
Master9000:	<:Ironic:307345212328509442>
SuperGummying:	bella back me up
SuperGummying:	not trying to be a creep or anything
MajesticEclipse02:	i identify as a fridge
SuperGummying:	thats all
SuperGummying:	just curious
MajesticEclipse02:	What doesn't make sense is a fire and steel type.... yet there still is one
regal swan:	girl y?
Dragonite:	okay professor oak
SuperGummying:	are you a guy or a girl?
Aqua033:	*Phew, I'm not the only one bugged by that*
regal swan:	yep

regal swan:	yea gymmy?
SuperGummying:	hey regal swan
regal swan:	yea
KingofZeal:	Yo, Regal Swan, can I capitlize your name, it's bothering me that your name isn't capped
MajesticEclipse02:	AND YET THAT'S THE TYPING ?
MajesticEclipse02:	an guess what, electric and flying don't mix
MajesticEclipse02:	it took forever and was so annoying because i had to use a stupid crobat just for mean look
MajesticEclipse02:	i finally caught zapdos on platinum again
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **regal swan leveled up!**
regal swan:	great now i thinking of pokemon lol
MajesticEclipse02:	okay i'm done, continue
MajesticEclipse02:	WE'RE DOOMED
MajesticEclipse02:	*magikarp appears*
MajesticEclipse02:	DESTRUCTION RAINS FROM THE HEAVENS
SuperGummying:	we all know that im winning this provoking game
Master9000:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
MajesticEclipse02:	or they go to the lavos punishment room lol
SuperGummying:	nope no fun at all
Dragonite:	well that's no fun
Master9000:	good luck
KingofZeal:	I'd rather the two of them just stop arguing
MajesticEclipse02:	hah
Dragonite:	yes
Dragonite:	a dragonite vs gummy room
Dragonite:	lol
SuperGummying:	lets see you take control
Master9000:	you sure u want to have that spill out here <@!304073163669766158> or do we just want a gummy vs dragonite room?
SuperGummying:	dragonite you be an admin on monday
MajesticEclipse02:	i'm only on discord nowadays to talk with the people i play games with and get notifications on stuff
Dragonite:	later
Master9000:	here we go again
KingofZeal:	v_v
SuperGummying:	fight me
SuperGummying:	dragonite
Dragonite:	that's an argument for it to _not_ exist, you dunderhead
SuperGummying:	and for me to have power
Master9000:	its mostly just a place for dragonite and gummy to go at it now
Dragonite:	@_@
SuperGummying:	camelot is suppose to be called The Gumlin Empire but no one likes that name
KingofZeal:	That's why I'm personally not a fan of it existing, splits people between two places
SuperGummying:	well
MajesticEclipse02:	heh
willofd2011:	Lol
SuperGummying:	^^
KingofZeal:	Camelot isn't here ya numpty
regal swan:	i actually forgot i was on
Master9000:	camelot isnt dead
KingofZeal:	I don't really want a bunch of empty channels that nobody is using
MajesticEclipse02:	it's like this one twitch streamer who does this thing called"shit show saturday" it basiclly let's subs reccomend games and the streamer plays them for a while
KingofZeal:	It was also really quiet on here today until I showed up and started talking
KingofZeal:	It's more a matter of do I want to organize it, lol
Master9000:	and have it be the description as well
KingofZeal:	I know it could be organized
Master9000:	we could just have a pin for whatever the game is
Master9000:	ehh
KingofZeal:	Yeah, that was my thought process
MajesticEclipse02:	game of the week/month sounds nice but it sounds complicated
KingofZeal:	But I also thought that might be too much of a pain to maintain
SuperGummying:	i like those ideas
MajesticEclipse02:	heh
KingofZeal:	I also thought about a "game of the week/month" type channel
Master9000:	oh wow timing
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> maybe a playthrough help channel to reference the roots of the community?
KingofZeal:	I actually did think about a Pokemon channel
regal swan:	what about a pokemon channel?
MajesticEclipse02:	art*
MajesticEclipse02:	stupid art but still ary
Kugallyblitz:	hey, I was just gone what are we up to?
Dragonite:	i just want a league/gaming channel so i dont have to scroll past five miles of it every morning
MajesticEclipse02:	memes are a form of art
regal swan:	hey blitz
Master9000:	it could jsut be merged with memes probably
Aqua033:	Yeah, I've gotten all my suggestions in
Kugallyblitz:	howdy friends
KingofZeal:	I suppose I could make something along the lines of a creative channel, but I'm still not sure if I find it needed
Aqua033:	Right now I'm just going through the servers I use and seeing what channels I use in them
willofd2011:	At least that's my excuse lol
willofd2011:	Then again we don't want to spam the chat with art pieces lol
KingofZeal:	For the record, the only real purpose for that channel would be to talk mods
Master9000:	just making sure for how the permissions are gonna be set up
MajesticEclipse02:	i sometimes send random stuff from time to time but no really all the time
KingofZeal:	I would make a restricted channel for only restricted people
Master9000:	https://bit.ly/m9k2017
Aqua033:	Eh, fair enough.
KingofZeal:	Are we really posting enough art around here for that to be relevent?
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> its not accessible to those who arent restricted right?
willofd2011:	^
Aqua033:	Art?
KingofZeal:	I had a restrictment room in mind
MajesticEclipse02:	punishment*
cadance:	obviously we need an ERP channel <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
MajesticEclipse02:	Lavos ounishment room, that's where the bad people go lol
KingofZeal:	Alright
Aqua033:	Anime, maybe?
cadance:	animu
KingofZeal:	What else
KingofZeal:	Online games, memes
KingofZeal:	Channels
KingofZeal:	So
KingofZeal:	Okay
Aqua033:	^
Master9000:	but for stream announcement, everyone is nice especially for people on mobile
Ozzi:	here is just people online
Ozzi:	cause everyone pings offline people too
Master9000:	typically
Ozzi:	@ here is preferrable to @ everyone
Dragonite:	thank for the ping
Master9000:	you dont get the `@everyone` notifications
MajesticEclipse02:	everyones muted ?
cadance:	so what happens if you mute @everyone <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
KingofZeal:	I was more concerned with channels
KingofZeal:	Don't care enough to worry about it atm
KingofZeal:	I'll think about it later
KingofZeal:	Eh
MajesticEclipse02:	huh
Master9000:	`@everyone` can still be denied that tho, i like the thought process
KingofZeal:	I would hope they can
Master9000:	the earthbound can talk
KingofZeal:	That's what I had in mind Aqua
Mee6:	<@263474950181093396> is no longer 🙊  here! He/she can speak 🐵 now!
Master9000:	!unmute <@263474950181093396>
Aqua033:	What I've seen is that people just have a general role for muting, and they just disable the role from talking anywhere
MajesticEclipse02:	typing* god i suck at typing
MajesticEclipse02:	oh you mean to stop them from rtping ?
Master9000:	you can also make an automatic afk room for voice to do that semi auto
cadance:	this isn't a voice channel, so muting wouldn't have anything to do with voice
KingofZeal:	I know that much
MajesticEclipse02:	learned*
MajesticEclipse02:	you can actually move people from one voice channel to another forecfully, i keaarned that today
Master9000:	
Mee6:	<@263474950181093396> is now 🙊here!
Master9000:	!mute <@263474950181093396>
Strike:	no its not
KingofZeal:	So mute is voice only
Mee6:	<@263474950181093396> is no longer 🙊  here! He/she can speak 🐵 now!
Master9000:	!unmute <@263474950181093396>
KingofZeal:	Guess not
KingofZeal:	Oh
willofd2011:	Something
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	I'm assuming it works
Master9000:	
KingofZeal:	Will, gonna mute you, try saying something
willofd2011:	That's a good question lol
KingofZeal:	No, we can test it now
Mee6:	<@263474950181093396> is now 🙊here!
Master9000:	!mute <@263474950181093396>
MajesticEclipse02:	not sure, i never really investigated the thing to much
Aqua033:	I can play around with it, hold on
Strike:	im here to test the mute feature 😄
Aqua033:	I'm...not sure, we've never really had an issue in vc
KingofZeal:	Talking, or typing, or both
Aqua033:	Talking
MajesticEclipse02:	or you from hearing them
Aqua033:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	Just prevent people from talking?
KingofZeal:	How does the mute feature function
Aqua033:	Then again, it has 8 mods, so they're kinda okay to do that
Aqua033:	What a server I'm on does is they pretty much just play it by ear with mutes
Aqua033:	Okay
KingofZeal:	Guys, stop meming, thanks
Master9000:	let me check if our current bots have it
KingofZeal:	I have no desire to utilize such a thing at this point in time, but I'd like it to be in place if need be
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Neptune leveled up!**
Neptune:	so is the Cathedral of Zeal where ppl go to worship lolis?
Master9000:	oh like that
KingofZeal:	As punishment for rule breaking, considering this is meant to be a large scale public server
Master9000:	like new people coming in?
superheronerd:	Zek is doing the good work here
KingofZeal:	I figure that should this channel exist long enough, might need to temporarily restrict certain people
Dragonite:	god damn it zek
cadance:	wrong master, the anime room is the "observatory of zeal" <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	whats the idea of application for it?
Zek:	
Master9000:	uhh
MajesticEclipse02:	make aaaalll the channels
MajesticEclipse02:	lavos will rise and the kingdom must be ready
KingofZeal:	realmaster, is it possible to make a role that people would automatically be removed from after a certain amount of time
Aqua033:	Because of all the shitposting there, Cadance?
Dragonite:	well dang
Master9000:	no thats the anime room <:Kappa:305551256104206336> <@!140627136900759552>
KingofZeal:	My goal is to name everything after an actual place in antiquity dragonite
Master9000:	i like it
MajesticEclipse02:	seriously
Dragonite:	"meme channel" should be "the dungeon of zeal" or something
Aqua033:	Memes and games and anime
Master9000:	gotta cultivate those icons
MajesticEclipse02:	hq
KingofZeal:	Meme channel is already in the plans
cadance:	yeah make a royal toilet for memes
KingofZeal:	I'm working on a plan to keep everything zeal themed
Master9000:	yeah memes definitely
Aqua033:	Memes, too
SuperGummying:	gaming channel will be nice
Master9000:	wouldnt coming up with half of these take away from the koz theme tho?
willofd2011:	Mhm
Aqua033:	Yeah, a gaming channel would be lovely
Aqua033:	Oh
Master9000:	should just have everyone do the hello there reaction for a headcount
cadance:	more like "sewer of zeal"
SuperGummying:	lol
OmoBio:	okay
KingofZeal:	k, I don't need anybody else to say they're here.  I was just making sure if I asked a question, people would actually respond, lol
Master9000:	holy shit lmao
OmoBio:	I am alive
Aqua033:	I'm here
regal swan:	i here
Kugallyblitz:	My vote goes for online gamimg channel voice chat/text chat
KingofZeal:	Perhaps, I was thinking of just having a music channel
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> does this include the song request thing you had in mind?
KingofZeal:	Figure it will probably be a league channel primarily but can include OW and HS
MajesticEclipse02:	that sounds interesting
SuperGummying:	so i can ban swimming in the other chat
Kugallyblitz:	A league channel would be nice
KingofZeal:	An online game channel was something I had in mind
cadance:	ooh i want snickerdoodles.... is there a royal bakery? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	ideas well have a channel for swimming
willofd2011:	Lol
Dragonite:	a league channel, so i can mute it
Master9000:	<:Ironic:307345212328509442>
cadance:	lmfao
KingofZeal:	no
Master9000:	can u /tts this for dramatic effect plz
KingofZeal:	And I want to know if you guys have any specific ideas for text channels
Neptune:	i stay up late way too often
Aqua033:	This is everything that I do, have done, and ever will do in my entire life
KingofZeal:	I'm planning out some stuff to reorganize the discord channel
MajesticEclipse02:	Ask thy question
cadance:	i don't wanna go to the principal's office again
superheronerd:	Hello

Master9000:	burn it off before you infect yourself <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deci:	so I spilled diesel on my hand earlier today, and didn't remember until just now when I scratched at my eye and went "What smells like diesel?"
Aqua033:	My friends are just being idiots and it's hilarious
Aqua033:	Nothing's wrong
Master9000:	dank
cadance:	the fact that head and shoulders doesn't have a body wash called knees and toes disappoints me almost as much as i disappoint my family
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> and the fun part of this thing is that there is no way to artificially have mee6 add points to your profile, only reset them
Master9000:	with how much you bring it up it sounds like youre meming about it
SuperGummying:	it was scaring me
Master9000:	<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
SuperGummying:	no
SuperGummying:	master
Master9000:	sticky stamp stop trying to meme it
Deino Mite:	i wish i could sub though <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
SuperGummying:	weeb
Deino Mite:	ya
SuperGummying:	just be careful or else you would owe $1500+ for no reason
Deino Mite:	plus, im saving for a trip to japan so i really need to save money
SuperGummying:	if you ever get one*
Deino Mite:	so i cant just sub to eyan
Deino Mite:	i dont have a credit card and thats you need a credit card to do online purchases
Master9000:	if not more lmao
SuperGummying:	be careful with your credit card
Master9000:	probably over a full year staring at a discord monitor to get that far
SuperGummying:	advice
cadance:	just use paypal
SuperGummying:	pimaster
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Deino Mite leveled up!**
Deino Mite:	but i dont have a credit card so i cant sub even though i want to 😦
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> yeah being active that much for 4 years straight you may as well be a sub for all the time spent here lmao
Deino Mite:	*x files theme intensifies*
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	*already paid*
Deino Mite:	what if i am actually a bot and you guys dont know it
Deci:	but, probably not, master. Eyan wants his highest tier to be pay-2-win, and it and the monarch role are the only teal-like colors
Master9000:	that would take on average ~213.2861111 days for the bot
Deino Mite:	but if i *made* the bot myself, you would be impressed enough not to ban it
Master9000:	and even then
Master9000:	so you need to make a really advanced bot algorith to not get caught
Deino Mite:	then i will make a new one
Master9000:	and no you cant because mee6 has stuff built in to stop
Deci:	we would promptly ban it
Master9000:	most likely more
Deino Mite:	ill create a bot that gets me there <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	nobody would get it for probably 4 years btw deino
Deino Mite:	yes
Master9000:	should we add a teal role for level 150 to see if anyone manages to get all the way up there ever?
Master9000:	assumed at that quantity with such a high sample size it would basically be average
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oof
Deci:	and that's the highest possible role color
Deci:	on average
Master9000:	dont worry, to get pink nu, you only need to do 12691 minutes
VortexOA:	that's years away
Deci:	okay, so it's not exponents, first of all
VortexOA:	i don't think anybody will
VortexOA:	yeah me neither
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not getting there like... ever, I guess
Master9000:	exponents get really out of hand
VortexOA:	wow
VortexOA:	lol
Master9000:	that would take the average person 1493.0027777 days of talking here if they talk 206 minutes a day
Deino Mite:	yay
Deci:	that's a good stat line
Deino Mite:	deci, are you proud of me?
Deci:	well, that doesn't really surprise me. increasing bounds and whatnot
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> i just extended the table and it would take a perfect bot at least 171 days to get to lvl 150
Deci:	yo, what's going on?
Master9000:	what happened?
Aqua033:	I'm just yelling and crying and I need to seek professional help
Deino Mite:	27 minutes. 11/3/2 217 cs. 20.5k damage
Deino Mite:	i won!
Aqua033:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Deci:	never seen VC
Deci:	I know IIRC
Neon Strike Kitty:	These are both common abbreviations
Aqua033:	Like why I say iirc instead of if I remember correctly
Aqua033:	My friend does it, so I guess I picked up on it after a while
willofd2011:	Same
Deci:	literally never seen it abbreviated. Ever.
Deci:	gotcha
willofd2011:	Lol
Aqua033:	Voice chat
Deci:	VC?
Aqua033:	At random times I just yell YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
Aqua033:	Remind me to never be on VC while playing Sion
Deino Mite:	closest thing is a xin on the enemy team
Deino Mite:	welp, neither team has a real tank
Deino Mite:	*sees lee jg hovered on our team and begins to have ptsd flashbacks*
Deino Mite:	alright
Deci:	not an adc main
Deci:	don't count too hard on it, I may play adc, but I'm a top lane main
Deino Mite:	k. im gonna go into a game and try to use this wisdom from the supreme chancellor
Deci:	yup
Deino Mite:	just get the 1300 gold component
Deino Mite:	ya ik not to finish it
Deci:	welcome back
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've returned from a leave of absence
Deci:	and you don't have to finish the last whisper
Deino Mite:	and get ie 4 and either bork or bt 5
Deci:	not necessarily. Tank meta becomes less about positioning to DO damage, and more about positioning to kite.
Deino Mite:	so, to play around tank meta as adc, should i just always get lw third item?
willofd2011:	Lol ^w^
Deci:	Oh, now wer're playing this game? i see a giggle machine. Always giggling
Deci:	Given that some of your played well and lost games can be construed to be games you just couldn't close out, I'd say your match history looks rather average. Which is a good indicator that you're at your actual level of play, give or take 1 or 2 divisions.
willofd2011:	How about me? Lol
Deci:	so I can't say I see much at all. I do like you as far as I tend to like people I dont know well, but that's about it.
Aqua033:	Okay
Deci:	I don't know much about you aqua
Master9000:	press q to get some form of deci
Aqua033:	What do you see when you look at me
Aqua033:	Deci, question
Deci:	played well wins: 8
played badly wins: 2
Deci:	W/L = 10:9 with 1 remake
Played badly losses: 4
played good losses: 5
Deino Mite:	and i need to learn to play around the tank meta
Deino Mite:	i think i need to just refocus. i believe i can make it to gold. i was high gold 5 last season at the end of the season and on my way to gold until my 5 game loss streak
Deino Mite:	k
Deci:	think i misscounted somewhere, let me go back over it, and I'll go to the ranked only tab as well
willofd2011:	*is confused as to what's going on* lol
Deino Mite:	but you just said i had 4 good/loss and 4 bad/loss so that would make 8 losses, right?
Deci:	that includes normals though
Deci:	you've got 6 losses, 13 wins, and a remake in your last 20 games
Deci:	bad/win:bad/loss 2:4
Divexz:	Adios
willofd2011:	Later ^w^
Deino Mite:	bye
Demon Lord 93:	see ya
Animal_Glue_:	cya m8
Kugallyblitz:	im gonna go guys 😛
Deci:	Good/win:good/loss - 9:4
Deino Mite:	whats the ratio of good and win:good and lose:bad and win:bad and lose approximately?
Deci:	So deino, given that I'm seeing games of all 4, it's probably just where your skill level is at right now.
Aqua033:	To be fair, though
I've been doing quite a bit better as of late
Master9000:	youll get there
Master9000:	lmao
Divexz:	only took me 4 tries
Deci:	ayyy
Divexz:	ayyy I finally won a game of league
Aqua033:	When you look at mine, you only see the first two
Deci:	I'm looking at your match history and I see 4 things: games where you performed like trash and lost, games where you performed like trash and won, games where you performed well and won, and games that you performed well and lost
Deino Mite:	i get objectives when i can, but if im the only winning lane, as soon as i get the tower in my lane then i have to rotate and teamfight to get towers and suddenly im against a 6/0 darius who can 3v1 us
Aqua033:	They are really nice on Warwick, though
Aqua033:	Hell, half the time I don't even notice cloud drakes
Deci:	My favorite combination when I'm not playing Jhin is actually Cloud/Mountain
Aqua033:	Mountain and Infernal are easily the two most important
Master9000:	earth drake op
Master9000:	yeah pretty much
Aqua033:	You can have all the kills in the world, but if you aren't getting any objectives, you're doing nothing with those kills
Aqua033:	To me, it's all about objective control.
Master9000:	nexus is best kill
Deci:	KDA and KP% are not absolute indicators of good play. I rarely get over 50% KP and i also rarely go above a 2.5KDA, yet I win enought to climb
Deino Mite:	https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Deino%20Mite look at my match history. only one of the last 4 games have i done really bad. theres one other loss thats not on there for some reason but i was like 9/4/14
Aqua033:	Sure, it *can* be an indicator
Aqua033:	I don't really think KDA is a really big indicator of how well you do
Deci:	High Kp% doesn't mean anything if most of them are solo klls
Deci:	And I just went from Plat 3 to plat 1 in a week, and was at 75lp, now I'm at a low plat 3 division. That doesn't mean it was my teams. I had an off week.
Deino Mite:	like, i am consistently having a kda of 3.0 or higher and high kp%
Deci:	Think of it this way in gold 4, you're likely to get matched up with people from Silver 1 up to Gold 2. in gold 2 you're likely to get Gold 4 - Plat5, in gold 1, you're likely to get people from gold 3 to plat 4. Because your division is a REALLY good indicator of your MMR, even when it gets thrown somewhat out of whack by weird circumstances.
Deino Mite:	well, i just went on a winstreak from like 0 lp silver 2 to series for gold 5. i was playing well consistently. during my series though, i started getting absolute trash level players and even though i kept up a decent score line, i lost my series and now im on a losing streak of like 5 games. only one of those games have i had a really bad kda. the other games, ive played well and just couldnt carry cus some assassin or tank got fed.
Master9000:	dont go on a massive loss streak
Deci:	you would probably still have low gold 3 mmr at least, and would then be matched again people with apparant higher tier than you
Deci:	lets say following the massive losstreak you end back up in Gold 4. Not as low as before, but lower than you were
Deci:	because the way that MMR is handled uses both your Win/Loss and other statistics as well. Probably consistency, winstreak, damage dealt, farm, healing done, stuff like that.
Master9000:	continue the wall
Master9000:	derp
Deci:	the only way for your circumstance to work would be if you went on an incredible winstreak FOLLOWED by an increadible loss streak or series of 1 win 2 losses
Deci:	Because of the way LP is handled (based on MMR) and how it's both lost, gained, and how promos work, at the end of your winstreak you'll probably have a Gold 3/Gold 2 MMR. So you would still be getting matched with people of your division.
Deci:	So lets say you go on a MASSIVE winstreak all the way to Gold 3
Deci:	We'll base this on 2 things
1. Your Division is Gold V
2. Your MMR is Gold V as well
Master9000:	uh oh
Deci:	So here's why that won't happen. (Prepare for wall of text)
Master9000:	no deci that meaning you can practice in a more chill envirnoment against higher tier players and learn and apply what u learned there
Deino Mite:	ok but lets say i go on a massive winning streak and get really high mmr. then, do i get matched with people that are lower mmr but are in the same division so that its harder for me to climb fast?
Deci:	No, your norms do not affect your ranked MMR
Master9000:	aka play norms
Deci:	I don't know what the exact way is, but I know it's somewhat like that
Deci:	You get matched with people based on a combination of your League/Division and MMR. That way if You're Gold 3 with Gold 1 MMR (hard to do, but I've done it in platinum) you'll be able to climb instead of constnatly facing high gold/low plat players every game.
Deino Mite:	just wondering, but if your mmr is high, do you get matched with worse players
Aqua033:	I know full well why I'm in bronze.
Aqua033:	I'd agree with that.
Deci:	^
Master9000:	no matter where you are youre in elo hell
Deci:	And i was in bronze once
Deci:	bad players happen, bad games happen. Some ARE unwinnable. This is so entirely rare that this is only the SECOND time I've been in this type of game.
Deci:	This is why I'm firmly in the camp of "If you say your teams are dragging you down, you're wrong, it's you"
Aqua033:	What
willofd2011:	O.o
Deci:	it happens in Platinum as well
Deci:	
Deci:	If you ever think you're in Elo Hell, just remember this picture
Aqua033:	~~By playing what I always play~~
willofd2011:	Nice lol
Aqua033:	I'm just trying to solidify my champion pool for right now
SuperGummying:	Yes
Master9000:	Now you tell me...
Master9000:	Wait that was the losers prize?
Divexz:	I would 100% be a burdan
willofd2011:	Dang lol
SuperGummying:	I retired from league because master beat me in that 1v1
willofd2011:	You can play with us if you want lol
Divexz:	Might as well boot up league as well
willofd2011:	Lol
Aqua033:	I'm doing the same

Master9000:	i beveled a cube 3 times
Kugallyblitz:	what are you guys up to
Kugallyblitz:	howdy partners
Master9000:	<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Master9000:	next time i make a part i should record it and then make it a time lapse
MajesticEclipse02:	how is everyone
MajesticEclipse02:	how is everyone
Deci:	why hello
MajesticEclipse02:	oh hello there
Deino Mite:	all the other ones, ive gotten a lead and had a good score through the entire game
Master9000:	wtf is tilt?
Deino Mite:	ive only had 1 game where i played bad personally
Deci:	not at all
Deci:	Til? None of us tilt.
Aqua033:	Could just be tilt
Deci:	I hear ya
Deino Mite:	but maybe its just me being butthurt that i was 1 game from gold and then the patch hit and now im 30 lp in silver 1
Deino Mite:	idk i feel like im so useless again like at the beginning of the season
Deino Mite:	oh
Aqua033:	Those are the only two others I've played
Aqua033:	Fiora
Aqua033:	I've been winning on Sona
Aqua033:	No
Deino Mite:	but have you been winning on mostly tanks?
Aqua033:	I've been playing a lot of things other than Sion
Deino Mite:	i said that i havent won any games on this patch, and aqua said he won many games
Master9000:	your point?
Deino Mite:	in a tank meta
Deino Mite:	you are playing tanks
Deino Mite:	thats why
Aqua033:	Mainly because it does half their health
Deino Mite:	"sion"
Aqua033:	Going in the bush level 1 as Sion, waiting for the other laner to step forward, and charging my Q is fun
Aqua033:	I've won many games
Deino Mite:	ill try getting lw earlier. i havent won a game on the new patch and its so frustrating
Deino Mite:	alright
Deci:	If you're to the point where you're doing no damage to tanks anyways, the ie isn't going to help much.
Master9000:	crit doesnt do much thru all that armor anyway
Deino Mite:	but like, that delays my ie on xayah then since i go er into zeal item
Deino Mite:	ill try that then
Deci:	Unless you've got a way to otherwise penetrate armor (vayne, cAit, etc)
Deci:	Rule of thumb as adc: 3rd item last whisper
Deino Mite:	i was so close to gold and then you come and do this to me
Deino Mite:	this isnt fair riot!
Deino Mite:	cus if my ap mid isnt playing well, then they just stack armor and even if im fed, i now cant kill them either
Master9000:	do i extrude or intrude my logo on the part?
Master9000:	yeah u basically have to duo now
Master9000:	but if your team has mixed damage or 4 ap and youre hte one ad, they have to prioritize MR but its reduced health will make it that much easier for you to kill
Deino Mite:	its impossible for me to solo carry a game now
Master9000:	makes single type damage teams a lot weaker
Master9000:	they made them more situational
Master9000:	they didnt buff tank items
Deino Mite:	its a serious problem when im a full build adc with lord doms and bork and i take more damage from thornamail than i deal to shyv
Deino Mite:	why did they have to buff tanks?!
Aqua033:	I need help
Aqua033:	I have a habit of yelling "YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE" Whenever playing Sion
LightsXBane:	Hey all

KingofZeal:	But I know ya'll don't want to do that, so *shrug*
Neptune:	and farm cabbages
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	My opinion is ya'll should just not worry about it and live here in the Kingdom, lol
Master9000:	But then whos the champion
willofd2011:	^
Neptune:	you could go with the Elite 4
Master9000:	You kinda already just did
SuperGummying:	Ask Eyan he will give us his opinion
SuperGummying:	4 pieces of triforce is good
Master9000:	That's just as bad as 4 pieces of the tru force
SuperGummying:	Master couldn't we just call ourselves the 4 musketeers?
Master9000:	While at the studio so can't play almost any games

Kireina:	sadly...
Kireina:	I awaken
SuperGummying:	Because gummy doesn't watch star wars
superheronerd:	How could you not hear of him?
SuperGummying:	Oh well
SuperGummying:	....
Master9000:	I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
SuperGummying:	No
Master9000:	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you are an onion
superheronerd:	May the fourth be with you guys 😁

Neon Strike Kitty:	Wait, not Froyo

Master9000:	Aka I'm really tired

SuperGummying:	wait wtf
Kireina:	I just act completely normal
Kireina:	I am gay
Deci:	Wait, I thought you WERE gay?

Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	and by yell I mean speak *very very loudly*
Kireina:	and/or yell a lot
SuperGummying:	and i tend to complain a lot
Kireina:	You can be tempermental
SuperGummying:	im very dramatic

Deci:	They thought I was gay because I had purple hair and can be dramatic and shit
Kireina:	lol
SuperGummying:	sooooo yeahhhh
SuperGummying:	they thought i was gay because i hang with girls instead of guys
SuperGummying:	i haven't been to a meeting for so long
Deci:	Welcome to the club, half the people I work with and half my regular customers thought I was gay at one point
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kireina:	and saw me as an outsider
Kireina:	they were all kind of pricks
Kireina:	I tried to join the lgbt club, but like...
SuperGummying:	nope i wasn't
Kireina:	at the time
Kireina:	THough i dont think you were in the server
SuperGummying:	i join like a club thing for that stuff as an ally
SuperGummying:	cool a friend in my class is a lesbian
Kireina:	I've said this awhile ago
Kireina:	Yes
SuperGummying:	really?
Kireina:	Then again I am gay 🤔
SuperGummying:	don't worry i have experience as well
SuperGummying:	even here i prefer to hang with girls over guys since im so used to it
Kireina:	I'm just saying from experience
Kireina:	I'm not saying don't
Kireina:	Well yeah
SuperGummying:	i can hang with who i want
SuperGummying:	so idc
SuperGummying:	i have always gotten along with girls way better than guys
SuperGummying:	idc
SuperGummying:	oh don't worry they already think that
Kireina:	Although, people might start think you're gay (generally how it works)
Kireina:	That also works
SuperGummying:	not hanging with the guys
SuperGummying:	keep hanging with the girls
Kireina:	I mean you can
SuperGummying:	yup note to self
SuperGummying:	oh yeah i can never avoid that
superheronerd:	yeah..
Kireina:	Although you should probably avoid that too
Kireina:	ok well as long as there was a mutual understanding
Kireina:	mhmm...
SuperGummying:	let's just say my punch didn't do anything
SuperGummying:	i did
Kireina:	*sigh*
Kireina:	orrr
Kireina:	Did you "playfully" punch them back
Kireina:	"Playfully"

Aqua033:	Because I didn't say hey
Aqua033:	Hey Deci
Deci:	everybody that said hey to me
Deci:	also hey
Aqua033:	I wish that wouldn't happen, they're a good support and I much prefer them to randoms I get
Master9000:	weird
Aqua033:	My duo partner queues support/jungle. They get jungle *more* often
Aqua033:	No
Master9000:	wait that doesnt happen anymore?
Aqua033:	I miss when people would queue support and they would always get support

willofd2011:	Dang lol
Kireina:	How are you
Kireina:	Hey Deci
Kireina:	lol
Deci:	and no, It couldn't possibly be because I'm awake at really odd hours
Deci:	damn you guys are talkative when I'm not around
Deci:	So i go to sleep, go to work, and come back to 400+ messages
Kireina:	Just worded differently
Kireina:	It's still the same meaning
Kireina:	Well I mean
Master9000:	could be i just thought of the memory and not the origional thought
Master9000:	?
Kireina:	I think you used the reverse of the actual quote LOL
Master9000:	i dont know what i dont know
SuperGummying:	do you like know everything in league?
SuperGummying:	master
Master9000:	feel free to quote me on that
Master9000:	removing attack speed reduction doesnt nerf it against a syndra

Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	But I don't understand how it was a thing
Kireina:	Ok I remember how it became a thing
SuperGummying:	because it came from a person i never want to talk about
SuperGummying:	im not telling you how hummy became a thing
Kireina:	When RM tries to get you to do his hw 🤔
Master9000:	in regards  to your sieze power plan, https://youtu.be/wzEOKb9UnQ8?t=1h2m14s <@199725993416589313>
Kireina:	or how hummy became a thing 🤔
Kireina:	Although tbh I really didn't understand that
SuperGummying:	is to become a video producer
SuperGummying:	and my true goal
Neon Strike Kitty:	you never plan things out
Kireina:	I mean I guess calling you hummy was fairly mean
Neon Strike Kitty:	they're goals
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, you actually need to realize that none of your plans are proper plans
SuperGummying:	not worry i hate you as well
Kireina:	but ok
Kireina:	I actually didn't
SuperGummying:	the only time you were nice was when i got beat up
SuperGummying:	panda you already hated me in the first place
Kireina:	Yet another reason for me to dislike gumgum
SuperGummying:	put stuff in microwave
Kireina:	Pretty much
Neon Strike Kitty:	Even though you don't actually know how to make spaghetti or bolognese
Neon Strike Kitty:	"I need to make dinner. Step 1: Make spaghetti bolognese. Step 2: Profit."
SuperGummying:	offer them things
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because let's face it, your plans are all along the lines of

Neon Strike Kitty:	Your overconfidence will be your downfall
Neon Strike Kitty:	You should still study

Kireina:	How are you guys doing
SuperGummying:	Tell them
Kugallyblitz:	MOST of the time
SuperGummying:	He knows
Kireina:	So anyways
SuperGummying:	Most of the time
SuperGummying:	I listen to blitz
SuperGummying:	See here is an example
Kugallyblitz:	I wonder if I'll ever level up
Kireina:	Same
SuperGummying:	I choose to forget
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm way too annoyed these days
SuperGummying:	I don't forgot right away
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Kireina:	Still clearly can't read properly (emphasis on ***Properly***)
Neon Strike Kitty:	I need water
Kugallyblitz:	theres a true story
Kugallyblitz:	today I finished my eocs and when my mom came to sign me out the proctors there said I was their favorite cos I wasn't annoying
Kireina:	I didn't say anything about listening
Neon Strike Kitty:	but you misunderstand or forget right away
Neon Strike Kitty:	You do listen
SuperGummying:	Not from you though
SuperGummying:	And I do listen
Kireina:	and might as well not have
Kireina:	At the very least you do, but it's slow
SuperGummying:	Yeah I do
Kireina:	But you most definitely do not learn
Kireina:	I never said from who
SuperGummying:	Just not from you
SuperGummying:	Also panda I do learn
Kireina:	*ran it over*
SuperGummying:	But it did cross me
SuperGummying:	I didn't run it over
Kireina:	*sigh*
Kireina:	Cause that poor cat
Kireina:	and by someone you mean it
SuperGummying:	I mean I think I may have actually made someone die
Neon Strike Kitty:	Maybe find a motto that's not either edgy or makes no sense
Kireina:	That motto is also something he can't even enforce
Kugallyblitz:	thanks a lot gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	That motto will get you in prison
Kugallyblitz:	oh no guess imma die now
SuperGummying:	"Death comes to anyone who crosses me"
SuperGummying:	My true motto is
Kugallyblitz:	we get a lot of annoying people at our door
Kugallyblitz:	it says "Thanks for not soliciting your products or religious ideas. If you continue to do this after reading this, I have the right to punch you in the face."
Kugallyblitz:	and outside our door we have a sign
Kireina:	Good
Kugallyblitz:	it's right in the entry way
Kugallyblitz:	not joking
Neon Strike Kitty:	that's a good motto
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
Kugallyblitz:	"Welcome to our home! Now go away and leave us alone."
SuperGummying:	You have to see the killing joke movie
Kugallyblitz:	it goes something like this
Kugallyblitz:	guys we have a house motto in my home
Neon Strike Kitty:	My motto is "It's not about the money. It's about sending a message."
SuperGummying:	He tried to turn Gordon crazy
Kireina:	Also why the hell is there even a pause there
SuperGummying:	Idk the joker used it in the killing joke movie
Kireina:	but half of us already have
Neon Strike Kitty:	What kind of motto is that?
Kireina:	I say yet
SuperGummying:	"All it takes is one bad.....day!"
Kireina:	Can we give up on him yet
Kireina:	Gummy will never learn
SuperGummying:	Here is my motto
Kireina:	*sigh*
Neon Strike Kitty:	No one wants to learn that
SuperGummying:	Teach him the way of gummy
Kireina:	When gummy can't read 🤔
Neon Strike Kitty:	Master, I think you would like this series http://darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html
SuperGummying:	Teach me what?
Kireina:	you even put the comic picture
Master9000:	yeah nobody will notice
Kireina:	you already did this meme
Kireina:	no stop it
Neon Strike Kitty:	I doubt anyone would notice if one or two senators went missing
Kireina:	Why would you teach him the way of the gummy 🤔
Master9000:	that some consider... unnatural
Master9000:	i have yet to teach him in the dark arts
Kireina:	and pretends to relearn it later on
Kireina:	he just throws that knowledge away
Kireina:	and we all know you can't teach deci
Kireina:	Deci is the senate
Kireina:	But
Kugallyblitz:	haha
Kugallyblitz:	*Also believes in daft punk*
Master9000:	**I am** the teacher of **The Senate**
Kugallyblitz:	*Believes stronger*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*believes in daft punk*
Kireina:	I don't think you're giving it your all
Kugallyblitz:	*Believes faster*
Neon Strike Kitty:	and there's a difference between selling and giving away
Kugallyblitz:	*Believes harder*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I sold one
Kireina:	Not enough Belief
SuperGummying:	Ida you sold my levels

Rainy:	So next weekend
Rainy:	When TSM gets eliminated more likely
Deino Mite:	but we will talk less when TSM isnt playinh
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because this is the most boring conversation I've seen in this server
Kireina:	Pretty much
Deino Mite:	when MSI ends
Neon Strike Kitty:	By normal I mean "no esports"
Rainy:	Normal is relative
Kireina:	This is normal
Kireina:	He's a bitch <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Neon Strike Kitty:	When can I expect this place to go back to normal?
Kireina:	I admit he's good, but like
Kireina:	I don't enjoy jensen
Rainy:	I will gut you
Rainy:	I just treat competitive league like a reverse harem
Kireina:	Jensen <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Rainy:	Also Sneaky is funny, Bunny is angry, and Jensen is just too precious for this world.
Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	to be specific
Kireina:	Hot Chick
Rainy:	That's all there is too it
Kireina:	yeh
Rainy:	I just listed two cute guys and a hot one
Kireina:	(not really)
Neon Strike Kitty:	This is all alien to me
Kireina:	I believe
Kireina:	But hey
Kireina:	yehh...
Rainy:	Not that bunny is really C9 anymore
Rainy:	But also Jensen and Sneaky and Bunny are my waifus
Kireina:	Love me some skadoods
Rainy:	I just like the org mostly
Rainy:	That too
Kireina:	I like their cs:go team
Rainy:	I don't even care about C9 as a LoL team, I just love their players
Kireina:	Can confirm we're all egotistical trash
Kireina:	Am from NA
Kireina:	She ain't wrong <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Rainy:	Mostly because NA is trash
Rainy:	I will laugh
Kireina:	xd
Kireina:	They won't go 3-0, but they'll definitely lose 3-1
SuperGummying:	Don't be salty about c9 losing
SuperGummying:	Rainy no
Kireina:	KT Rolster *cough cough*
Kireina:	or at least go close with them
Deino Mite:	^
Master9000:	nobody is good until they beat SKT
Rainy:	Gonna be a good time
Rainy:	I'm gonna laugh when TSM gets 3-0ed by a semi decent team
Neon Strike Kitty:	Every single one
Neon Strike Kitty:	The teams are all shit

Deino Mite:	true
Rainy:	Well OVAs are for memes
Deino Mite:	mostly just make all the girls have lots of fan service moments
Deino Mite:	but OVAs are where you get to make your favorite characters do whatever you want so they are cooler
Rainy:	World's is the OVA where you realize all your favourite characters actually suck in the big picture
Deino Mite:	*hype*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*flips the bird*
Rainy:	Summer split is the anime
Deino Mite:	when is the anime coming out?

Neon Strike Kitty:	This is all an alien language to me
Master9000:	Deterministic Disaster Recovery Tool
Master9000:	found the name
Kireina:	I mean can't forget to use chronobreak if you ain't jensen *insert that meme here*
Master9000:	wait nvm that IS chronobreak
Master9000:	just use the disaster whachamacallit tool
Kireina:	xd
Kireina:	I mean riot is based in NA
Deino Mite:	except bjerg isnt on ekko so he cant forget to cast chronobreak
Rainy:	Riot might be a fan of "lol NA" memes
Kireina:	xd
Kireina:	Learning from C9
Rainy:	We shall see
Deino Mite:	ya its scripted so they can reverse sweep
Kireina:	<:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
Kireina:	Oh snap TSM game is 2-2? 0:
Kireina:	This school week has been extremely...useless
SuperGummying:	Alright you win this round ida
SuperGummying:	Alright what if um
Kireina:	Grats xd
Neon Strike Kitty:	And now I'm level 30

Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Neon Strike Kitty leveled up!**
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm complaining about my internet again
Kireina:	What's happening? 🤔
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not even joking
Neon Strike Kitty:	Getting no internet would be *an improvement*
Deino Mite:	its ok. its scripted
Rainy:	Because I'm no league professional, but god damn, they're sloppy today
Rainy:	Hopefully TSM has remembered how the game works
SuperGummying:	Still tsm needs to reverse sweep
SuperGummying:	I know
Rainy:	But TSM didn't win that game, GAM just threw
SuperGummying:	But not paying attention
SuperGummying:	I'm trying to
Deino Mite:	i see everyone else is also watching MSI
SuperGummying:	Yay 2-2
Rainy:	#SilverScrapes
SuperGummying:	So that means you get no internet Ida that's worst
Dragonite:	also my internet is fine, my computer just isn't
Dragonite:	that's boring
SuperGummying:	I'll destroy your internet
Dragonite:	what the crap, i'm orange now
SuperGummying:	But I know what's better
Dragonite:	no
SuperGummying:	Alright Ida fine that is torture
Neon Strike Kitty:	even that being unlikely
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you basically get free internet and access to software plus faster render times
Neon Strike Kitty:	and 200 being the lowest you get
Neon Strike Kitty:	with 1k spikes
Neon Strike Kitty:	Try playing with that happening to you twice a game
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's called being DC'd, Gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	the whole time
Dragonite:	your point being
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's just 500
Neon Strike Kitty:	meaning it doesn't go to 501 or 499
SuperGummying:	Yes I can ida
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you always complain about your pc and my school just got premiere pro, photoshop and after effects
Neon Strike Kitty:	Can you play in a 500 ping without variation?
SuperGummying:	Ida I can play in any ping
Neon Strike Kitty:	forcing you to play ranked on my internet
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, I'm going to subject you to the most cruel torture I can think of
Neon Strike Kitty:	*grabs lamp post*
Dragonite:	no
SuperGummying:	Dragonite wanna go to my school?
Dragonite:	_noms immortality_
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you run
SuperGummying:	Hey I am immortal
Dragonite:	you should have started running like an hour ago
Aqua033:	/s
Aqua033:	Like me
Aqua033:	Not when you're immortal
SuperGummying:	Should I start running?
Aqua033:	No it won't
Neon Strike Kitty:	You have no idea how much that statement alone got on my nerves
Neon Strike Kitty:	"Ida I never annoy you"
Dragonite:	saying "gummy tends to annoy me" is like saying "standing next to an atomic bomb might get you hurt"
SuperGummying:	It's the other way around
SuperGummying:	Ida I never annoy you
SuperGummying:	But I only learn or listen to a few people
SuperGummying:	Ida I do learn/listen
Neon Strike Kitty:	and also because you tend to annoy me
Aqua033:	Holy shit sign me right the hell up
Neon Strike Kitty:	I do it because it's the only way to get you to learn!
SuperGummying:	Yup
Aqua033:	An hour?
SuperGummying:	$80
Aqua033:	How much do you get paid?
SuperGummying:	Than why do you do it?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't actually like to
Neon Strike Kitty:	*beats Gummy up*
SuperGummying:	Well Ida likes to beat me up
SuperGummying:	Ida and Dragonite like to provoke me
Aqua033:	It's just not the first thing I'd expect
Aqua033:	Yeah, I do too
Neon Strike Kitty:	*waves goodbye from the ferry*
SuperGummying:	*kicks Dragonite*
Neon Strike Kitty:	We do this weird RP thing sometimes
Aqua033:	...You know what, I'm just not gonna question it
Neon Strike Kitty:	*is out of range*
SuperGummying:	*throws a spike ball at ida*
Dragonite:	_builds a wall around Gummy_
Neon Strike Kitty:	*is already very far out of the way*
SuperGummying:	*punches ida*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*moves out of the way*
SuperGummying:	*drop kicks ida*
Dragonite:	_high-fives Ida_
Neon Strike Kitty:	*burns down the tomb*
SuperGummying:	Hey at least I feel royal now
Dragonite:	_locks Gummy in Napoleon's tomb, on the double_
SuperGummying:	Because I'll get scared
Dragonite:	why not
SuperGummying:	You can't do that
SuperGummying:	Okay no Dragonite
Dragonite:	_locks Gummy inside Napoleon's tomb_
SuperGummying:	I need to see Napoleon's tomb
SuperGummying:	I been to Paris before but I was young so that's the second thing on my list
SuperGummying:	I been to the states before but LA is on top of my list
Dragonite:	that's why it would be rather difficult to visit them
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you live in the states
Neon Strike Kitty:	but it's frickin *boiling*
Dragonite:	the United States
Neon Strike Kitty:	like now
SuperGummying:	Dragonite what's on top of your list?
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's nice in spring
Dragonite:	_goes to add to his list of Countries He's Never Visiting_
Neon Strike Kitty:	-15, maybe
SuperGummying:	-34
Dragonite:	so what does it get down to in the winter?
Neon Strike Kitty:	well it's enough to completely roast me
SuperGummying:	It's about 16 degrees Celsius here
Dragonite:	that's nothin'
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's about 20 degrees celsius
Dragonite:	_goes to sit in a trash can_
Dragonite:	(･ω･)
Dragonite:	hot on Iceland standards, or hot on everywhere-else-on-the-planet standards?
SuperGummying:	This is payback for the past
SuperGummying:	That means I can finally hurt you!
SuperGummying:	Than regular leggings?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not gonna be wearing metal in this weather
Neon Strike Kitty:	Do you know how frickin hot it is today?
SuperGummying:	You are supposed to be wearing spike leggings
Neon Strike Kitty:	Stop kicking me, it hurts goddammit!
Aqua033:	We had two people AFK at the start
Aqua033:	Hoo boy
SuperGummying:	*kicks ida*
SuperGummying:	I wasn't I was just saying.....
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't be racist
Neon Strike Kitty:	It can be German if it wants to be
SuperGummying:	Ida thats French
Aqua033:	"Yeah I have months of experience and I've played every single hero up to level 5 at least, I'm gonna play some god damn AI"
Aqua033:	Why
Aqua033:	Just
Aqua033:	This is the dumbest quest
Neon Strike Kitty:	It was 50/50
Neon Strike Kitty:	Bonjour
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can probably speak German
Rainy:	I can speak memes
Aqua033:	你好们
Aqua033:	I can speak chinese
Dragonite:	:>
Dragonite:	gummy los meyus
Dragonite:	i speak dovahzul
SuperGummying:	I like Spanish though
Neon Strike Kitty:	this is an English server
Neon Strike Kitty:	Stop speaking frickin spanish
Rainy:	Clearly
SuperGummying:	Rainy tsm is the best
Rainy:	Lose so I can laugh at them, win because NA is already a big enough joke
Rainy:	I want TSM to both lose and win
Rainy:	Get them that reverse sweep buff
Rainy:	They need to sub out anyone for Hai
SuperGummying:	Just two more games tsm
SuperGummying:	Tsm better win
SuperGummying:	Okay 1-2
Dragonite:	｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
Dragonite:	we're all losers here
Neon Strike Kitty:	No one is
SuperGummying:	Who's winning?
Rainy:	This series is fun to watch
Rainy:	Oh hey, Hauntzer remembered how to play League
SuperGummying:	Join my class
SuperGummying:	Animal man
Animal_Glue_:	lol
SuperGummying:	She left already
SuperGummying:	Darn
SuperGummying:	Alright I'll put ice in it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Goodbye
SuperGummying:	You also get a free glass of water
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm leaving
SuperGummying:	$100 per hour
SuperGummying:	I'm teaching it
SuperGummying:	Wanna join my class ida?
SuperGummying:	Yup
Neon Strike Kitty:	.....and that's all of history?
SuperGummying:	Mongol empire, French empire or British empire
SuperGummying:	There's only three answers
SuperGummying:	Well it's history
Neon Strike Kitty:	Maybe his class isn't about the Mongol empire
SuperGummying:	He refuses to write down the Mongol empire
SuperGummying:	But master doesn't want my help
SuperGummying:	The only thing I'm good at is like history
SuperGummying:	Math what is math?
superheronerd:	Retaining math is my downfall 🙃
Aqua033:	Learning is ez
Retaining the things you learned is the hard part
SuperGummying:	I came in with a 65% and ended with a 58%
SuperGummying:	My pre calculus was 58%
SuperGummying:	50% is fun
Animal_Glue_:	It'd be nice if you were forced to learn things that actually mattered and had an affect on everyone's lives...
superheronerd:	50 percent still boggles me as to how it's a passing grade
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Learn!*
SuperGummying:	So that's my learning
SuperGummying:	As long as I get over 50% I pass
SuperGummying:	Ida I do learn
Neon Strike Kitty:	Learn!
SuperGummying:	50%
Neon Strike Kitty:	Learn!
SuperGummying:	For me I pass by the bare minimum
SuperGummying:	Hmmm school
Aqua033:	Holy shit this team trickles so hard
Aqua033:	Welp I just got a quadra
Aqua033:	My Gragas is yelling at our Tahm to gank me because Tahm's ganked 10 times, when there's a herald pushing my lane down
Aqua033:	tfw my mid and bot are putting more pressure than my jungler
Aqua033:	Fiora
Aqua033:	Yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh, right
Neon Strike Kitty:	What champ are you playing?
Master9000:	It's just a parry the q when going Agro and kill or get out before he gets it back up game
Neon Strike Kitty:	At least you're not up against your own internet connection
Aqua033:	But still not as fun as Maokai
Aqua033:	Still an easy lane, especially pre 2
Aqua033:	Aww, I'm against Teemo
Neon Strike Kitty:	I hate my connection
Master9000:	Here's the bullshit I came up with on Monday https://docs.google.com/document/d/12H80vI3wMPSX1JYvnttXh5hNja2ZPhtDUAhEdZBVSic
superheronerd:	Thankfully I get to see my professor today, so I can get some insight
Deino Mite:	^
superheronerd:	Cohesively.
Deino Mite:	It's being able to take knowledge, interpret it in a way that supports your argument, then put a bunch of those together into a single paper.
Aqua033:	Me: *Picks Fiora into Yasuo, thinking he's top* This gon be gud
Other team: *Picks Maokai* This just got so much better
superheronerd:	Mine is an argumentative essay. The formatting is throwing me off a bit
Master9000:	Essays it's just luck with remembering the right content to fight for it (assuming history essay) or if you actually read the book if English
Deino Mite:	Do*
Deino Mite:	I am the same thing for essays most of the time.
Master9000:	It's more of multiple choice that I blaze thru
Deino Mite:	Academics has always come very naturally to me because I'm a very fast learner and I retain information well so as long as I pay attention in class, I don't need to study.
Aqua033:	I just half ass them at the last second and get near perfect scores
Aqua033:	Yeah, I don't know how I do well on essays tbh
Deino Mite:	Honestly, it's not really something that can be taught. It's just kind of a matter of how fast of a learner you are and how well you retain information which I don't really know if that can be taught.
Aqua033:	Eh, I've never cared ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	Yeah it's one of the main reasons I left the champion mains discord
superheronerd:	Teach me your ways, guys. I'm totally blanking on my essay
Aqua033:	I've known people with very NSFW pictures before
Deino Mite:	Didn't see it before
Deino Mite:	Oh ok
Aqua033:	Look on the online list
Aqua033:	Manawolf25
Deino Mite:	Who is mana wolf?
Aqua033:	So it does
Master9000:	Lmao from icon size, manawolf's profile pic looked NSFW
Aqua033:	So I really just need one
Aqua033:	That being said, I never do anything in one of them
Deino Mite:	I'm the kid who doesn't study and still gets an A+
Aqua033:	It's to the point where I have to have two study halls to keep up with my grades
Master9000:	Same
Aqua033:	I have a really solid work ethic in school, the moment I get out I want to stay far far away from schoolwork
Master9000:	Everything else about it I can tolerate
Master9000:	I just don't like homework and school hours
Aqua033:	My issue has never been in class, it's always been out of it.
Aqua033:	In my brother's school, he was just given the same work but more of it, so he ended up with no life
In my school they told us that it was that exact thing outright
Master9000:	Less annoying people to slow them down so the teacher has more time to explain stuff
Master9000:	From what I've heard, they're easier than the normal classes
Aqua033:	I've never wanted to do honors classes, due to my family's past experiences with them
Aqua033:	My science class is so bad that my teacher has lost all control of us
Master9000:	Both of those I just talk with my friend most of the time because it's slow af even tho they're both honors courses as well
Aqua033:	That's my science class and my math class
Master9000:	Welcome to my English class
Aqua033:	The only reason I don't like school is because my classes are full of little shits who can't shut up
Aqua033:	Same
Master9000:	I get bored of repetitive or simple stuff super fast
Rainy:	I'm a horrible student
Rainy:	Ha nerd
Master9000:	Same but I do homework
Rainy:	I'm a lazy shit but I retain everything, so I test great but do no homework... school is wonderful
Master9000:	I'm me In that one
Aqua033:	I never do any homework, I never study, and yet I still get B's and A's on every test
Aqua033:	That picture is actually me
Rainy:	lul Turtle
Rainy:	Watching TSM at MSI
Master9000:	
Master9000:	I found the perfect prequel meme for my history class tomorrow
willofd2011:	Lol
Master9000:	With what
SuperGummying:	Master you're not helping
Master9000:	*dodges the arrow that was flying for the door he was coming in through which dragonite was a solid 15 meters away from*
SuperGummying:	*shoots Dragonite with an arrow*
Dragonite:	_catches Gummy's foot in a butterfly net_
SuperGummying:	*kicks Dragonite*
willofd2011:	Lol
willofd2011:	Oh noes D:
Dragonite:	_picks up poking stick_
willofd2011:	*pokes dragonite back*
Aqua033:	So, the usual
Aqua033:	Well, I'm dead inside
Dragonite:	_pokes chat_
willofd2011:	What's up lol ^w^
Aqua033:	Hello!
willofd2011:	Hai ^w^
Aqua033:	A funny thing my friend and I had while watching the second episode: "Well, if you're so skinny that you're weightless, that means you probably have anorexia, which is a considered an illness."
"And guys are into that."
JelloHammer:	Yeah, she seems like the fun-to-wtch type lol
Aqua033:	I really like her
JelloHammer:	I haven't seen much of Senjougahara yet, but people rate her very highly
Aqua033:	It's wonderful
JelloHammer:	Shaft is head tilts galore
Aqua033:	Yeah, I'm aware
Kireina:	There's also an odd order in which the series is read & watched in
Kireina:	Show's hilarious
Aqua033:	We started on Sunday
Aqua033:	Yeah
Kireina:	so you just started then
Kireina:	I see
Aqua033:	The head tilts
JelloHammer:	After all, its by shaft
JelloHammer:	its pretty good
JelloHammer:	Im actually watching it rn as well
Aqua033:	No
JelloHammer:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	Bakamonogatari
Aqua033:	But for now we're just on Bakemonogatari
Aqua033:	We're eventually gonna watch all of them
Aqua033:	<@116347313080762372> funny enough, I'm watching Bakemonogatari with a friend
SuperGummying:	Ida you missed me blowing stuff up
Kireina:	lol
Dragonite:	_slaps computer_
Neon Strike Kitty:	it was so bad it stopped working several months ago and I had to replace it.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dragonite, I've got a worse computer than you
Neon Strike Kitty:	*whew*
Neon Strike Kitty:	So I spend several hours away and don't actually miss anything
Kireina:	Currently watching Nisemonogatari with a friend
Kireina:	Yo Bakemonogatari is lit
Dragonite:	(･ω･)
Dragonite:	ironically, the only people i've met who have worse computers than i do are other game devs
Aqua033:	Look, actual art
SuperGummying:	Dragonite my computer is better
Aqua033:	Potatoes have more chromosomes than humans
Dragonite:	your computer is a potato
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you're a potato
Aqua033:	If you want context, in Chinese we were supposed to draw what was described. I had the privelage of drawing small eyes, a big nose, and a big mouth
Animal_Glue_:	Well, I guess that is art.
Aqua033:	Look, Art™
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
Dragonite:	in other news, i did not get a good night's sleep last night
Dragonite:	he was a potato with arms and legs streaming what might have been Civ
Neon Strike Kitty:	*juggles potatoes*
MajesticEclipse02:	That is odd
MajesticEclipse02:	Well then
Dragonite:	that has to be one of the all-time weirdest dreams i've ever had
Dragonite:	so i had a dream that Eyan was a potato
Neon Strike Kitty:	now eat your hamburgers, Apollo
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's nice
MajesticEclipse02:	I LOVE YOU ALL !!!!!!
Aqua033:	Anyone who wants to unintentionally ruin other friendships, that's who
Neon Strike Kitty:	Who needs friends, pfft
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not allowed
Aqua033:	What, I can't enjoy watching things with my friends?
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~weeb~~
Aqua033:	But, I do prefer ending the day with Monogatari instead of beginning it with it
Aqua033:	If I had the choice, I'd be fully nocturnal
Neon Strike Kitty:	same with day and morning
Neon Strike Kitty:	Evening/night is when I want to go to sleep
Master9000:	And evening/night is when I'm hyper creative and want to do all the shit except for sleeping
Master9000:	Same but I'm operational 5 hours into the sequence
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm just not a morning person, it takes me a few hours to wake up
Master9000:	You mean sleep deprivation o'clock?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Morning
Master9000:	Nah dude twitch has plenty of attack speed in his kit and usually gets 2 attack speed items so he can sacrifice as boots
Noex:	So prepare for Super Smash Bros in League
Noex:	Also, new game mode is coming out this weekend
cadance:	when sneaky builds tabi on twitch bot.... i think tabi meta may have gone too far
cadance:	based on that last game, and others like it, i think i'm playing around a low plat level sometimes... now if only i could get that consistent
cadance:	oh and i had highest gold in game
cadance:	does this mean i'm good?
cadance:	also had second most cs in game, next to our vlad
cadance:	i like xayah better as a top than an adc
cadance:	wow i came really close to vayne in damage that game
cadance:	i think this game is locked up
cadance:	vayne and vlad
cadance:	ooh the double plat on my team
Kireina:	indeed
willofd2011:	Yeah lol
cadance:	that was like 3 hours
cadance:	whoa is stream already over?
Kireina:	lol
Aqua033:	CSing is super easy on Xayah for some reason
Aqua033:	Welp I just carried on my worst role
Deino Mite:	Ikr
Deino Mite:	*level 7 Xayah*
Aqua033:	Especially when you have a good support
Aqua033:	Xayah is *fun*
Zek:	lowkey
Dragonite:	don't tell anyone
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you are a Pokemon
Dragonite:	. . . oh wait . . .
Dragonite:	_declares war on Pokémon_
Animal_Glue_:	lol
Animal_Glue_:	The mustached man himself?
Animal_Glue_:	Ozzi is here?
Animal_Glue_:	wait a minute
Neon Strike Kitty:	Pokemon is one of the worst animes ever
SuperGummying:	~~Watch Pokemon ida~~
Deino Mite:	you know that video that i posted yesterday of the op to eromanga sensei? this is it now
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've tried a lot of anime
Deino Mite:	thats a decision that is not well educated on both sides and therefore is not a very good opinion to base my decision on
Neon Strike Kitty:	Thank you~
Master9000:	You're welcome
Master9000:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	*watches as the above gets pinned*
Master9000:	Gooood
Neon Strike Kitty:	Anime is boring anyways
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eyan's my decision
Deino Mite:	eyan or anime? tough decision
Neon Strike Kitty:	*spams troll messages @Eyan 24/7*
Master9000:	But yeah that's what bureaucracy is anyway, we just report the important stuff to Eyan because he doesn't have time to read every troll message 24/7
Kireina:	lmao
Kireina:	xd
Kireina:	Cause I've used every curse word LOL
Kireina:	Guess it is
Master9000:	That's not enough people gumbo

SuperGummying:	well i call me an Emperor
Kireina:	<@!304073163669766158> Do something or something...thx

Neon Strike Kitty:	There's people in every monarchy who shout at the king until he does things
SuperGummying:	im not talking about this chat
Kireina:	Everything goes thru deci's ears and out into eyan's
Kireina:	Lies
Master9000:	You don't have to address Eyan directly it may be an absolute monarchy but there is still a bureaucracy
Neon Strike Kitty:	but yeah

SuperGummying:	nah cargo pants are better
SuperGummying:	leggings hmmmm
Master9000:	To either party
Master9000:	Can't relate
superheronerd:	This is the first time I've ever heard someone say leggings weren't comfy
Master9000:	There's a difference between physically possible and individually capable
SuperGummying:	Not scared
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Is this like me not being able to scare you?
SuperGummying:	I can do the same to you
SuperGummying:	You can't guilt me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Doesn't mean I can't guilt trip him about it
Master9000:	He's trying to make up for all those times you burned or killed him
SuperGummying:	...you tried to bring down an avalanche on me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Why you always gotta hurt me 😦

Aqua033:	I think, at least
Kireina:	IBC? 🤔
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kireina:	LUL

Kireina:	I remember the days of when I used to have 52 cs at 17minutes
Neon Strike Kitty:	in a bad matchup
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd be maybe 62
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can cs better than that, I think
Aqua033:	Are you 52 CS at 17 minutes bad?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've always been a bit of an awful adc 😛
Aqua033:	This reminds me of why I stopped maining support
willofd2011:	Oh noes D:
Aqua033:	And hitting her W
Aqua033:	Such as CSing
Aqua033:	My ADC can't do ADC things
Aqua033:	Save me
Aqua033:	Oh
Neon Strike Kitty:	might be connected
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's a guide for it on the Leona mains subreddit

SuperGummying:	Idk
Dragonite:	why woudl i lie about something as dreadful as being allergic to cats
Dragonite:	because i like birds
Dragonite:	gummy can not like birds
SuperGummying:	Dragonite I thought you lied about being allergic to cats
SuperGummying:	I like birds
Kireina:	Closing the gap one word at a time
Kireina:	same
Dragonite:	cats seem to know i'm allergic to them
Neon Strike Kitty:	even then she doesn't seem to dislike me
Neon Strike Kitty:	except the old one but I think she remembers things
Neon Strike Kitty:	Cats seem to love me
superheronerd:	I think they can tell that I'm a dog person and they take it out on me
Kireina:	I think I have a natural affinity for animals
superheronerd:	Cats don't like me 😭
Kireina:	They refuse to leave me until I start dying
Neon Strike Kitty:	That doesn't look like anything working for the devil
Kireina:	or work for the devil
Neon Strike Kitty:	*looks to the right of my screen*
Kireina:	I have a strong belief cats are the devil
Kireina:	It's like they know I'm allergic to them
Kireina:	Thats not the worst part
Lightning:	That sucks 😦

Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm apparently a Fire Dragon Slayer
Kireina:	Ida is a Fire-Breather <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>

Neon Strike Kitty:	If I won't like it then probably don't tell me
Animal_Glue_:	XD
Animal_Glue_:	and never tells us
Animal_Glue_:	and teases us with it
Animal_Glue_:	where he lets everyone know he has a secret
Animal_Glue_:	Gummy does this thing
Animal_Glue_:	sigh
SuperGummying:	Trust me
SuperGummying:	You won't like it
SuperGummying:	Remind me later to tell you ida
Kireina:	Gummy fly to Bella and let her throw you
Neon Strike Kitty:	Carpenter bees?
SuperGummying:	Bees
Neon Strike Kitty:	the latter usually causes more problems than the former
superheronerd:	Pls hide me.
Master9000:	Hell yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	My way of relieving stress is either to set things on fire or to be stressed at people
superheronerd:	Apparently we now have carpenter bees.
Animal_Glue_:	XD
Kireina:	lets me relieve stress
SuperGummying:	I'm not saying it here
Kireina:	Cooking is fun
SuperGummying:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're actually a master chef?
SuperGummying:	I'm not going to do it
Animal_Glue_:	oh boy
SuperGummying:	Nah
SuperGummying:	Maybe I should tell ida that one little thing I always forget to tell
Kireina:	Except the ones I dated and eventually dumped because I realized gay people are extra
Neon Strike Kitty:	Tell them I did it for *science*
Neon Strike Kitty:	But I intend to die frozen and alone
Kireina:	Theres no gay people in my community college **sigh**
Kireina:	unfortunate
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't actually know enough people to do that
Kireina:	*one day eyan will love me back* <:FeelsBetrayedMan:272080639572836355>
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~I could hook you up with someone~~
Kireina:	Because it makes me feel better about myself and lets me pretend there are other gay people in the world 🤔
Neon Strike Kitty:	*throws the hat out the window*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Huh, out of batteries
SuperGummying:	Idk I laugh at everything
Neon Strike Kitty:	*puts on a purple hat*
Neon Strike Kitty:	...alright then
Kireina:	I just like to make things gay
Neon Strike Kitty:	How was this funny?
SuperGummying:	But panda made it funny
Kireina:	I have
SuperGummying:	Nope
SuperGummying:	Lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Have you never heard this figure of speech before?
Kireina:	the ***tip*** ey?
Kireina:	woah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dragonite has a vague perspective on my number of names, but it's just the tip of the iceberg
SuperGummying:	Seems like ida is the most common one
Neon Strike Kitty:	You have no idea
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
Animal_Glue_:	Also I don't appreciate Ida's 10,000 different names
Kireina:	I liked it
Kireina:	the book was pretty good
Kireina:	I mean
Neon Strike Kitty:	Bloody mee6
Neon Strike Kitty:	❤
Animal_Glue_:	I can appreciate character development
SuperGummying:	Heard it was um bad
Animal_Glue_:	I was actually joking lol
SuperGummying:	No thanks
Neon Strike Kitty:	it might be a start.... in a way
Neon Strike Kitty:	well, I suppose you can if you want to
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, don't read that
SuperGummying:	50 shades of grey!
Neon Strike Kitty:	*blocks animal man*
Neon Strike Kitty:	unless you read something like Twilight, I don't think that has character development
Animal_Glue_:	Action is better anyway
Neon Strike Kitty:	If you read books, you start learning what character development is
Animal_Glue_:	I don't read either
Neon Strike Kitty:	But <@199725993416589313> If you watch a movie, you get action scenes. If you read a book, you get character development.
SuperGummying:	Yeah I learn I just don't wanna read
Kireina:	Good day to you as well
Kireina:	is how
Kireina:	Because Instant Transmission
Neon Strike Kitty:	Good day
Animal_Glue_:	good day
Neon Strike Kitty:	Did you dodge all of them?
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's like 50 books
Kireina:	*runs away*
Kireina:	Sorry I forgot to mention you have to hit me with one
Kireina:	*matrix mode activated*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*throws the entire Discworld series at Panda*
Kireina:	If you throw a book at me I'll read
Neon Strike Kitty:	You really never learn
Kireina:	*sigh*
SuperGummying:	Or I could just watch the movie
SuperGummying:	Maybe
Neon Strike Kitty:	or something like that
Neon Strike Kitty:	Reading enriches the mind
Neon Strike Kitty:	You honestly should read
Kireina:	Or didn't do conventional gummy things
SuperGummying:	Ida do I look like a reader to you?
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't help but feel like me and Gummy would have fewer disagreements if he read more books
Kireina:	but the anime does <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm already disappointed
Kireina:	not really
Kireina:	Pokemon sucks <:LUL:305559915714576385>
SuperGummying:	You won't be disappointed
SuperGummying:	Watch x and y
Kireina:	So anyways
SuperGummying:	Yup
Neon Strike Kitty:	It just proves the anime has its head up its own ***
Kireina:	*sigh*
SuperGummying:	Maturity
SuperGummying:	http://satoshipediaeng.altervista.org/focus-how-ash-has-changed-and-matured-over-the-years/
SuperGummying:	Here this proves he's older
SuperGummying:	Best wishes does not count at all
SuperGummying:	Because best wishes tried to soft reset
Neon Strike Kitty:	>On a related note, Ash is still considered 10 years old in promotional materials as well as the first episode of Best Wishes despite Best Wishes Until We Meet Again! strongly implying that at least a full year had passed since his time in Johto.
Neon Strike Kitty:	?
SuperGummying:	Not that

SuperGummying:	I got proof
SuperGummying:	Well he technically is 16
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ash is still 10
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just looked this up, it's actually a thing
Neon Strike Kitty:	in the ORAS chapter he's 20 years old
SuperGummying:	Meh ash was like 16 in x and y
Neon Strike Kitty:	and he *actually frickin grows up*
Neon Strike Kitty:	He takes his shirt off at one point
Neon Strike Kitty:	Red's pretty great in the FireRed/LeafGreen chapter
SuperGummying:	X and y ash is the best
Neon Strike Kitty:	But on a serious note, I think you should read the Pokemon Adventures manga
SuperGummying:	Yes Ida

Kireina:	It's nothing against him at this point
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm planning on going to sleep early and I can't do that if I need to try to act as a peacekeeper here

Kireina:	I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who blocked gummy
superheronerd:	I agree.
Kugallyblitz:	and this is supposed to be a friendly welcoming community
Kugallyblitz:	it's hurting feelings
Kugallyblitz:	c'mon

Kireina:	What time was I supposed to unblock gummy again?
Kugallyblitz:	moral of story, bees are awesome, and they are awesome, oh yeah and did I mention how awesome they are?
SuperGummying:	I tend to cut there heads off
superheronerd:	As you should
SuperGummying:	I hate wasps though
Kireina:	pls no
Kireina:	That sounds like a nightmare <:BibleThump:305806695999995904>
superheronerd:	Which sucks, I exercise out there sometimes
superheronerd:	It makes me super reluctant to go my backyard
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't know where the hive is but there tends to be one flying around nearby
Neon Strike Kitty:	We get bees here in the summer sometimes
Kugallyblitz:	IMO anyways
Kugallyblitz:	it'd be cool to go out and see them, not interact or interrupt, but look at them close p with a bee suit once in awhile
superheronerd:	A tree in my backyard is swarmed with bees every summer ):
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Kireina:	w/ my floral hawaiian shirt
Kireina:	and im like hell no i ain't going out there
Kireina:	and i see swarm of 10 bees out there
Kireina:	like I look out the window
Kireina:	and I swear shes trying to kill me
Kireina:	My mom planted a field of flowers in my backyard
Kugallyblitz:	like 3 times a year tops
Kugallyblitz:	I will see bees very occasionally in the spring in my back yard near flowers, so beautiful they are
Kireina:	and carry an epi-pen on me at all times
SuperGummying:	How often do you see bees though?
Kireina:	so now I book it
Kireina:	but I found out the hard way I was allergic
SuperGummying:	Ida I think you might be insane
Kireina:	well yeah
Kugallyblitz:	When i was little whenever a bee would come near me I'd just walk away at a fast pace cos they are one of those species that's misunderstood by some
Kireina:	they were small and fluffy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think they're floofy
Kireina:	I can't remember what they are called, but I loved a type of austriallian bees
Kugallyblitz:	I like them
Kugallyblitz:	for what they do and stuff
Kugallyblitz:	bees are cute
Neon Strike Kitty:	but I think bees are cute
Kireina:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kugallyblitz:	no Bee movie 2 comingout now
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm probably insane for this
Kugallyblitz:	berry died
Kireina:	thankfully
Kireina:	Didn't get stung
Kugallyblitz:	poor Berry
Kireina:	I sat on a bee once
Kugallyblitz:	I've never been stung by a bee ever
Kugallyblitz:	ouch bella
Kireina:	me: this bitch
Kugallyblitz:	XD
Kireina:	me: *sprays bug spray at them*
Kugallyblitz:	LELELELE
Kireina:	"whats that weird smell" said everybody
Kugallyblitz:	Bees are awesome even though they can be aggressive, it's their instinct so they gotta do what they gotta do
superheronerd:	No fun
superheronerd:	I got stung on the neck by one when I was younger
SuperGummying:	So I like them
Kireina:	which is why I freak out during spring time
Kireina:	I'm allergic to bees
SuperGummying:	Bees make honey
Kireina:	LOL
superheronerd:	Bees terrify me lmao
Kugallyblitz:	and that's the story of how a bee made a school bus trip much more dangerous
Kireina:	Damn my cousin
Kireina:	Mostly due to the music
Kireina:	Also, I'm sadly enjoying Love Live!... *sigh*
Kugallyblitz:	one time on a school field trip a bee managed to get in the bus and it landed on my back and all of the students started to hit me over and over with their back packs. dunno if they were trying to kill the bee or they really hated me and found a chance to take it out on me without suspicion.
Kireina:	But we've been neighbors and friends since kindergarten
Kireina:	Other then 1 person
Kireina:	That I hang out with
Kireina:	Only problem with beings friends with everyone is that I can't really identify a true group of friends
superheronerd:	Jeeez
SuperGummying:	Or über
SuperGummying:	Taxi
Kireina:	LOL
Kugallyblitz:	didnt wana puke at all

Kugallyblitz:	one time I was in a bus and someone pooped their pants
Kireina:	So everyone ends up getting to know me to a degree
superheronerd:	Bus rides are nice
Kireina:	I always say I'm shy
Kireina:	and idk
Kireina:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	*hit by a train*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I like trains
SuperGummying:	Buses are fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	I got it wrong
Kugallyblitz:	and why do you like buses panda?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Darths and Droids
Kugallyblitz:	ooh thats cool
Kireina:	I like buses
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's basically Star Wars as a DnD game
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm reading Droids and Darths
Kugallyblitz:	how are those treating you?
Kugallyblitz:	busses
Kugallyblitz:	ech
superheronerd:	Waiting for a bus

wolverale12:	kk
Kireina:	He should enjoy what he likes to do not feel obligated to do so
Kireina:	Or stream when you want to etc.
Master9000:	i cant get it to not ping lol
Kireina:	And so I always put play what you enjoy
Kireina:	Hey jack
JaCk:	aye yo whaddup man u nappy boi whaddup
wolverale12:	hmm
Kireina:	even though I know they are suggestions and he doesn't have to
Kireina:	I never like to suggest anything
JaCk:	everybody has a right to an opinion even if its wrong i guess
Master9000:	@ KingofZeal permission for execution upon the infidel?
JaCk:	bad game.
wolverale12:	I suggested playing Torchlight II with viewers
JaCk:	EWWWW
Neon Strike Kitty:	Chrono Trigger
wolverale12:	Did you guys suggest any games for Eyan in his survey?
Kireina:	Yeah
Master9000:	its never binary
Master9000:	he either thinks everything is serious or everything is a joke
Kireina:	I care for gummy dude, but it's like he doesn't realize not everything is a joke 😐
Kireina:	then unblock
Kireina:	and be like oh yeh
Kireina:	and open one up
Kireina:	and be like wtf are these blocked messages
Kireina:	In an hour i'll forget
Master9000:	oh weird i thought i saw one on the stream
Kireina:	I don't need reminders LUL
Kireina:	Thats just how long I've decided to unblock gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Someone remind Panda
Kireina:	oh no theres no timer option
Master9000:	i blocked anthony and it didnt give me the 3 hour option
Kireina:	but I'm not going to
Kireina:	like I could open up gummy's blocked message if I want to
Master9000:	oh ok just that
Kireina:	It's pretty neat
Kireina:	Yeh
Neon Strike Kitty:	and prevents them from sending you DMs
SuperGummying:	Oh well going to go back to the other chat and do what I need to do with Dragonite
Neon Strike Kitty:	It basically puts messages from the blocked party in a spoiler
Kireina:	It's pretty <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Master9000:	lets see who to block
Master9000:	i havent tried it
Kireina:	this is quite the interesting experience
Kireina:	so thats how blocking works
Kireina:	huh
SuperGummying:	Cya????
Kireina:	See you at 6:28
SuperGummying:	.......
Kireina:	for the next 3 hours
Kireina:	I'm gonna block gummy
Kireina:	same
SuperGummying:	Wait I thought all this time you guys were basically joke arguing
SuperGummying:	I never said anything
Neon Strike Kitty:	but I'm kind of annoyed so I'm gonna find something calming to do
Kireina:	Because you're the person who decided to reject common sense
Neon Strike Kitty:	idk
SuperGummying:	How did it go from Dragonite rivalry to this?
Kireina:	That
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	What did I do?
SuperGummying:	Meh close enough
Master9000:	its botspam anyway lmao
Kireina:	but gummy actually has made me more annoyed at him then I thought possible
Master9000:	nobody did panda
Neon Strike Kitty:	Asking master to make the bot add leona mains threads to the botspam channel?
Kireina:	I didn't think it was possible in the 30 minutes I was gone
SuperGummying:	Mee6 bot Reddit thing
Neon Strike Kitty:	The what?
SuperGummying:	Ida you did make the Reddit one
Master9000:	i mostly talk gummy out of making idiotic ones if he didnt already blow something up by the time im there
Master9000:	nope
Neon Strike Kitty:	Have I ever made decisions in the other chat?
SuperGummying:	You know for some reason I tend to disagree with your guys decision making in the other chat
SuperGummying:	*slams head on desk*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seriously
Neon Strike Kitty:	You said should of again
Master9000:	no
SuperGummying:	You see why you aren't elder admin now?
Master9000:	no you didnt
SuperGummying:	And master I knew I should of made you a general
SuperGummying:	Darn it
Neon Strike Kitty:	*should have
Master9000:	Sebastian sticky stamp would <@!141255588846895105>
SuperGummying:	I knew I should of made you a field officer
SuperGummying:	....
Neon Strike Kitty:	Who in their right mind would make me an admin?
SuperGummying:	It's not like I study your attitude before I made the decision
Neon Strike Kitty:	Exactly
SuperGummying:	Yup no common sense there
SuperGummying:	*ahem* made ida an admin
SuperGummying:	Maybe two
SuperGummying:	Well there is one person that can help me
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't think of any examples of you using common sense
SuperGummying:	See
Deino Mite:	so, i found the full version of an anime op i really like from this season on youtube. $10 says this gets taken down or isnt allowed in the country within 2 weeks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr3zIflMd5c
Neon Strike Kitty:	wait, nvm, I can't help even if paid
SuperGummying:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because I'm offering to help if you do
SuperGummying:	Ida why would i pay you?
Master9000:	thats why i said it shouldve been harem of bevels
Neon Strike Kitty:	You were one of his waifus
Deino Mite:	its my life goal
Deino Mite:	but i was happy being a part of Eyan's harem
Dragonite:	don't question these things, pimaster
Neon Strike Kitty:	How much will you pay, Gummy?
Aqua033:	I'm going into a game I can't
SuperGummying:	Help aqua
Deino Mite:	why did the server name change from "Harem of Zeal" to "Kingdom of Bevels"?
Aqua033:	Uhh
Deino Mite:	gummy, its too difficult to back you up that even if you payed someone, cus no one would willingly, they wouldnt be able to
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	Common sense
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
Master9000:	back you up on what gummy
SuperGummying:	Aqua help
Master9000:	on what
SuperGummying:	Okay someone back me up
Dragonite:	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Master9000:	*happily didnt own gummy to begin with*
Neon Strike Kitty:	The bouncer is not gonna let you in
Dragonite:	_disowns Gummy_
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's like hiding your invitation card when going to a VIP party
SuperGummying:	It's fun
SuperGummying:	Well I want to hide it
Dragonite:	that in and of itself is a failure of common sense tbh
Master9000:	youre not supposed to hide it <:FailFish:305611995787296768>
Dragonite:	well then, that kills the point, doesn't it?
SuperGummying:	I just don't show it in front of you
SuperGummying:	Yeah I do
Aqua033:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	You don't have common sense
Dragonite:	and a lot of issues
SuperGummying:	I just have listening issues
SuperGummying:	Ida I have common sense
Dragonite:	_crashes back down to earth_
SuperGummying:	All in favour of crowning gummy as emperor, raise your hands
Dragonite:	_shoots through the roof_
Neon Strike Kitty:	All in favor of exiling Gummy into the depths of classes about common sense and social etiquette, raise your hands
Dragonite:	that's the point :^ )
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's still too cruel
Dragonite:	_starts levitating into the air_
Dragonite:	fine. all in favor if exiling gummy to the depths of 4chan, raise your hand
Neon Strike Kitty:	He'd be even more insane
Master9000:	so nothing will change ok
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's a nasty place
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't think exiling him to the depths of the internet will do anything but remove his sanity
Master9000:	vote with the reaction emotes
Dragonite:	_raises both hands, both feet and his tail_
Dragonite:	all in favor of exliling Gummy to the depths of the Internet, raise your hand
Master9000:	idk why we still bother with him <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Kireina:	He has to do it himself
SuperGummying:	Gummy never explains to anyone
Kireina:	I can't do anything about it
Kireina:	In the end
Kireina:	Also, everything I've said are purely suggestions for him
Master9000:	yeah its not for health but it is a healthy amount, its you vs mayo on this one and i trust the instrument
Kireina:	It helps as a guideline as sorts for people
Neon Strike Kitty:	but BMI isn't a scale for healthiness
Kireina:	The way he responds makes it seems like he doesn't take anything into consideration
Master9000:	citation: the treaty which didnt have any words on it for an actual agreement less than 2 hours ago
Neon Strike Kitty:	Master, that's still not quite healthy
Kireina:	Oh thats not why
Master9000:	he never explains anything
Kireina:	This is also the reason why I hate you to a degree btw.
Master9000:	Mayo clinic comes back with the same number as well <:FeelsGoodMan:305609186996125696>
Kireina:	Because you're not explaining that context gummy
Kireina:	Now are you saying you refuse to gain or you can't.
Kireina:	You're like just below average RM
SuperGummying:	I'm staying 115 pounds
SuperGummying:	Nope not gaining
Kireina:	And that's somewhere b/t minimum and well normal iirc
Master9000:	im in the ok but bellow average range
Kireina:	To be considered normal (in terms of weight/BMI) for 5'8 you looking at about 130 ish pounds
Kireina:	You can do that while being fit and weighing more
Kireina:	Not necessarily
SuperGummying:	I mean is it healthy I can feel pretty much every bone in my body?
Master9000:	food*
Kireina:	get some fat
Kireina:	and by a decent margin
Kireina:	thats underweight
Kireina:	thats not healthy
Kireina:	no
Kireina:	you can't give me pounds w/o height
SuperGummying:	5'8"
Kireina:	How tall are you
SuperGummying:	I'm 115 pounds and 16 is that healthy?
Kireina:	Panda
Kireina:	It's me
Kireina:	Hi
SuperGummying:	Okay here panda
Kireina:	because I could probably load one up faster
Kireina:	which = free win
Kireina:	why not I'd use one better then gummy
Master9000:	not muskets <@!116347313080762372>
SuperGummying:	Just as ida or Bella
Kireina:	So anyways back to weapons wat are yuh sellin
SuperGummying:	I am healthy
Neon Strike Kitty:	This is true
Kireina:	Also, ***You're not healthy gummy***
Kireina:	hand me dat bread
Kireina:	I'll eat bread
Kireina:	Yo bread
SuperGummying:	Not healthy
SuperGummying:	Ida don't eat it
Neon Strike Kitty:	*puts the peace treaty on bread*
Neon Strike Kitty:	You always do something
SuperGummying:	*gives ida peace treaty*
SuperGummying:	What did I do?
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Are you really?
SuperGummying:	Hey I didn't do anything I'm innocent
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes
Kireina:	Because I'm gonna need more then ammo
Kireina:	or what
Kireina:	Hey Ida you got weapons too
SuperGummying:	Yes Ida don't eat me
SuperGummying:	I didn't hit the cat
Neon Strike Kitty:	...alright then
SuperGummying:	Oh idk what your taking about
SuperGummying:	Yes I am
Neon Strike Kitty:	Are you a cinnamon roll, Gummy?
Kireina:	and you almost ran one over w/ absolutely no remorse for the cat
Kireina:	Also, the only nice thing I see on there is the cat
Kireina:	B U L L Y
SuperGummying:	I'm nice
SuperGummying:	I'm a sylveon
Neon Strike Kitty:	*sets up munitions shop*
Kireina:	Gummy bullies me
Kireina:	I also attempt to fight anyone who refuses to like me ***stares at gumgum***
Kireina:	then woop woop
Kireina:	Unless you buying me Chicken Fries
Kireina:	I hate burger king tho
Kireina:	I would say for the most part I'm an espeon and a Flareon 🤔
SuperGummying:	You do go to Burger King right?
SuperGummying:	You seem to be an espeon
Dragonite:	a magikarp
SuperGummying:	Dragonite what are you?
SuperGummying:	Oh close enough
Neon Strike Kitty:	sounds close enough
Dragonite:	she's actually a dragonair
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's not quite words
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's when I try to talk
SuperGummying:	You make strange noises?
Neon Strike Kitty:	No
SuperGummying:	Can I borrow nail polish than?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm also the Glaceon
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm the Umbreon
Master9000:	if you do logic well enough its more fun than anything you could do
SuperGummying:	You can't always think of logic
SuperGummying:	Lol come on master you gotta have some fun
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	They know about my health
SuperGummying:	I thought you were a cat though
Master9000:	a human
SuperGummying:	What are you?
SuperGummying:	I'm a sylveon
Master9000:	thats a what eeveelution are you chart
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Master9000 leveled up!**
Master9000:	thats not a treaty
SuperGummying:	That's the treaty
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> <:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	
Master9000:	where are the actual words for it?
Master9000:	you never even gave me peace treaty to begin with
SuperGummying:	*gives ida peace treaty*
Master9000:	gummy
SuperGummying:	Fine I'll give ida the peace treaty
Master9000:	gotta have stuff match
Deino Mite:	i was wondering cus you also named the survey that
Deino Mite:	ok
KingofZeal:	In this case, it's the rules for the server
KingofZeal:	EyanShottGG is a reference to the owner of CLG and former League pro HotShotGG.  He looks so similar to me that somebody once mistaked me as him at a convention.  He also was known to keep a document called secretstratsGG around so I often mimic that when naming important "documents" that I keep around
SuperGummying:	Dragonite 1000 gummy 5?
SuperGummying:	What's the score btw?
Deino Mite:	ah
SuperGummying:	I need help though
Master9000:	someone at a convention once thought he was HotShotGG
SuperGummying:	Master I'm losing the provoking game
Master9000:	its a meme
Deino Mite:	<@!304073163669766158> what is EyanShotGG?
Master9000:	***__Gara__***
Master9000:	*PTSD from essays*
superheronerd:	Eww formal English
Master9000:	tbh i get along better with older people than with people my age
Master9000:	that is idiotic logic
SuperGummying:	Dragonite and ida are old I think it makes sense we should team up on them
SuperGummying:	We are young
SuperGummying:	Yeah you know master
Master9000:	well thats specific
SuperGummying:	Master let's make peace
Master9000:	*actually reads it and its all just gummy copypasting a bunch of fancy words in one run-on sentence*
SuperGummying:	*gives master a peace treaty*
Master9000:	thats not a very effective way of solving your problems NOR making friends/"allies"
SuperGummying:	*kicks Dragonite*
Dragonite:	now see what youve done
Neon Strike Kitty:	and now I'm afk again
SuperGummying:	*kicks ida*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was afk for this
Neon Strike Kitty:	*shrugs*
SuperGummying:	I need allies of my own
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	*kicks all three of you*
SuperGummying:	Is this all because of listening?
SuperGummying:	I love how you three always team up against me
SuperGummying:	Yeah I am
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Master9000:	nope lol
Dragonite:	is gummy ever innocent, really
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	I'm innocent
SuperGummying:	I didn't do anything though
Master9000:	Karma's a bitch
SuperGummying:	She will step on me
SuperGummying:	I don't wanna be stuck to ida all day
Master9000:	*doesnt let gummy do that either*
Dragonite:	/me tapes gummy to ida's spike leggings
SuperGummying:	*tapes a musket to master*
Master9000:	your masking tape wont hold anything over 5 lbs gumbo
SuperGummying:	*bribes ida with fire*
Master9000:	she wont
SuperGummying:	*gets ida to do it*
Master9000:	*doesnt let gummy do that*
SuperGummying:	*tapes master to a window*
Master9000:	you can tape a ~~dog~~  gummy to a keyboard but you cant teach it to ~~play league~~ make proper citations
Master9000:	no
SuperGummying:	These books help
SuperGummying:	Here more research
Master9000:	did you have a thesis statement anywhere in the "research"?
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	No
Master9000:	was it peer reviewed?
SuperGummying:	Ida that was research
Master9000:	someone may have been boosting you and then just died to make it look more realistic
Neon Strike Kitty:	*research*
Master9000:	you can claim anything but that doesnt make it credible
SuperGummying:	I was 20/1 that game
SuperGummying:	No
Master9000:	plus the one champion you could achieve this on, anivia, is dead in the screenshot so the victory is also likely due to the factor of teammates carrying your ass
SuperGummying:	No you would know my advice is bad and that it was in march
Master9000:	oh yeah good point and the "research" isnt even remotely up to date, several patches old at least
SuperGummying:	You don't need to see that
Master9000:	why
SuperGummying:	Don't look at the calendar
Master9000:	plus there are tons of other factors you didnt account for
Master9000:	sorry buddy you skipped a step
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	Um here Is my research
Master9000:	if 0/0 doesnt get the cant divide by zero rule applied, why not?
Master9000:	wheres the research to support that?
SuperGummying:	Does
SuperGummying:	Yeah it sure
Master9000:	0/0 doesnt mean always
SuperGummying:	My advice always works
SuperGummying:	Nah it won't trust me
Master9000:	that would include the monitor
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm sure this made sense in your head
SuperGummying:	Because you would be too dizzy to see other things
Master9000:	how does being dizzy help concentrate on the game?
SuperGummying:	It makes you dizzy so you can concentrate on just the game
Master9000:	how so
SuperGummying:	Um it helps you play league better
Master9000:	Why
SuperGummying:	Um run around in circle today
SuperGummying:	Here master I'll give you advice
SuperGummying:	Ida don't be mean 😭
Master9000:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	Because you did
SuperGummying:	What makes you think that?
SuperGummying:	Nope I didn't
Master9000:	Idk man it looked like you shoved my advice into your rectal cavity
SuperGummying:	See took your advice to heart
Master9000:	Get rekt
SuperGummying:	Looks like I'm playing it
SuperGummying:	So what is it?
SuperGummying:	Here I'll listen to your advice today
SuperGummying:	Okay master
SuperGummying:	Lol
Master9000:	
Master9000:	Here's the only screenshot I got from the demo :/
Master9000:	Yeah
SuperGummying:	Is 4 months long to you?
SuperGummying:	Master it doesn't take that long
Master9000:	Also I just played a 4D demo of heroes of the storm
Master9000:	I question why it takes people so long to listen to me about anything tbh
SuperGummying:	And I question why I didn't listen to master about switching sooner
SuperGummying:	It used to be okay back than
SuperGummying:	Tbh now I don't
Neon Strike Kitty:	I never liked Skype anyways
SuperGummying:	I do remember you telling me to switch to discord awhile back but that took a month
SuperGummying:	Master
cadance:	this is my luck with ranked topkek
cadance:	instead they report you for feeding, even though your lane was a 2v1 and you still outdamaged your whole team
cadance:	and nobody else will report him
cadance:	tfw your jungler literally admits to throwing a ranked game because you didn't give him a leash
Dragonite:	im kind of recording something atm so i should probably do it some other time
Neon Strike Kitty:	If you want to
Dragonite:	are we getting on gummys case about freezom again
Neon Strike Kitty:	which one is that again?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Almost at the next thing, then
Master9000:	Also level 19
Master9000:	Just pointing out the similarity in the two situations
SuperGummying:	I'm not him
SuperGummying:	Lol
Master9000:	Reminds me of convincing Eyan to get in discord and then him immediately loving the format once he understood it
SuperGummying:	Only took 3 months
SuperGummying:	I eventually did
Master9000:	Not to me
SuperGummying:	See I listen
SuperGummying:	I did
SuperGummying:	Lol
Master9000:	That was everyone in the entire multiverse telling you to drop it as well tho
SuperGummying:	110% revenue
SuperGummying:	Like I listen to master's advice on freedom!
SuperGummying:	Panda there's occasional times I do listen to other people
Master9000:	Eyan is busy
SuperGummying:	Well maybe ida
Kireina:	Gummy has listened to me a total of 1 times
SuperGummying:	Or Ida
Master9000:	Don't play the new heroes of the storm 4D demo
SuperGummying:	Give it to Eyan
Kireina:	lol
Master9000:	I should just send Bella anything I want to say to him so that she can send it to him
Master9000:	Idk why I bother with gummy anymore
SuperGummying:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	Do you ever heed his advice?
SuperGummying:	I would never ignore master's advice he's wisdom remember
Neon Strike Kitty:	so you can ignore his advice
SuperGummying:	Master tell him stories
SuperGummying:	And I always listen to master <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
cadance:	oh wait nvm i get it
SuperGummying:	Bella, Eyan, and sometimes Ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm impresed
cadance:	wtf was that about master
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK, wow
Kireina:	well 1 since I'm going to assume bella is also one
Kireina:	who are the other two people
Kireina:	Damn Nice
Master9000:	And <@!140627136900759552> outside is a standalone game which sucks and is really buggy and the sensitivity is randomly generated ad well ad all of your other stats and most are not rerollable, the few that are require ridiculous amounts of in game currency
SuperGummying:	That's 3 people I listen to
SuperGummying:	See I do listen to people
Kireina:	I wanna c it
SuperGummying:	Nah I actually took your advice ida, I studied
Kireina:	Hey RM you got that rank chart
Kireina:	Anyways
Kireina:	*wow* another level
cadance:	ding

Kireina:	Hey RM
Master9000:	He bribed everyone
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~Who did you bribe?~~
SuperGummying:	Last time I talked to you ida I had a 66% in science
SuperGummying:	No I'm doing good
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK so clearly that teacher is a sham
SuperGummying:	I got a 77% in science
SuperGummying:	My science/gym teacher
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK what scammer's teaching this class?
Kireina:	79% failing? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	It's one of my best classes
Kireina:	lol
SuperGummying:	79%
Neon Strike Kitty:	And you haven't failed yet?
SuperGummying:	It's called personal finance
SuperGummying:	Since February
Neon Strike Kitty:	How long have you been taking this class?
Kireina:	Budgeting doesn't always include money gum gum
SuperGummying:	Rent and stuff like that
Kireina:	Not always
Neon Strike Kitty:	Then *WOW* you need to study
Kireina:	Hit me with some scenarios
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Does budgeting have anything to do with money?
SuperGummying:	Yes
Kireina:	DO YOU REALLY?
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Kireina:	Do you though
SuperGummying:	I know budgeting
Neon Strike Kitty:	.....Sidon and studies
SuperGummying:	No it's about budgeting
SuperGummying:	Imma wing it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Siddown and studdy
SuperGummying:	I'm currently in school waiting for a test
Kireina:	cause all these weak ass classes are irrelevant
Kireina:	I mostly talk when I'm at school lmao
Kireina:	I guess
SuperGummying:	I don't have a life
SuperGummying:	Well it shows one thing
Kireina:	Yeah probably
SuperGummying:	My priorities is doing nothing
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's gonna take at least a year for anyone to get that far
Kireina:	Does it really matter who gets ahead realistically? cause I mean we'll all eventually hit the last rank (assuming we are still part of the community for that long)
cadance:	what game is that dlc for?
cadance:	outside?
Neon Strike Kitty:	You should try it sometimes, Gummy. See where the priorities are.
SuperGummying:	Go outside......
Neon Strike Kitty:	from time to time I play games, talk to people, go outside
Neon Strike Kitty:	You know, I actually have some other things to do than be here
Neon Strike Kitty:	....wow
Kireina:	lol
SuperGummying:	You know what I'll stay up all night and make sure ida doesn't get ahead of me
Kireina:	You don't have to, but I prefer to be liked
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~luckily I'll be able to remedy this when I work the night shift~~
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
SuperGummying:	I don't like you
Kireina:	ok the latter is probably not true, but the first part is
SuperGummying:	That's mean panda
Neon Strike Kitty:	All the discussion happens from like 10 pm to 5 am my time
SuperGummying:	Hey I heard that
cadance:	i'm surprised i exist
Kireina:	when gummy saying something that is either irrelevant or worthless xd
Neon Strike Kitty:	Time zones
SuperGummying:	I'm surprised I'm beating ida
Kireina:	Then again I was silent up until like 2-3 years ago
Kireina:	I'm surprised I even have second place to begin with to be quite honest
willofd2011:	Lol
Kireina:	I mean thats fine
Neon Strike Kitty:	*gonna get you*
Neon Strike Kitty:	OK, so I'm just one behind

SuperGummying:	*takes Ida's $2*

SuperGummying:	Ida I always study
Aqua033:	I want it to be midnight
Neon Strike Kitty:	And actually study this time.
Dragonite:	_picks up Gummy by the collar and flings him into the classroom and locks the door_
Neon Strike Kitty:	Go to school
SuperGummying:	I don't wanna go to school
Neon Strike Kitty:	Morning (she says, at 2 pm)
Kireina:	This is funny, but also very very sad :(
Kireina:	...
Aqua033:	me
Kireina:	xd
Dragonite:	stay up all night on the weekends, though
Dragonite:	you mean, sleep is for the week
Master9000:	
Aqua033:	Then again, I'm gonna end up sleeping because I can in most classes and I need sleep but I'd rather not at home
Aqua033:	Yep sleep is for the weak

JelloHammer:	Night Bella!
superheronerd:	Have a good night, guys
Deci:	will check it out when you officially post it, night man
willofd2011:	Night Eyan ^w^
superheronerd:	Goodnight
JelloHammer:	Goodnight Eyan
SuperGummying:	Night Eyan
KingofZeal:	Okay, welp, I'm off to bed, if anybody reads this, feel free to drop survey feedback, I'll officially post it tomorrow everywhere
JelloHammer:	can't wait to rectify that asap
JelloHammer:	argh not having a credit card is such a hinderance
JelloHammer:	or the month after that at the latests
KingofZeal:	That's fine, it's really no big deal
JelloHammer:	Should be up by next month
JelloHammer:	Also Eyan, I'm pretty sure my patreon for this month didnt go through
KingofZeal:	Also makes it a lot easier for me to justify spending on anything that I may want to buy for the sake of stream quality and/or games to stream
KingofZeal:	I doubt I'll be making tons of money, but every little bit helps
KingofZeal:	Ads are also soonTM
JelloHammer:	Huzzah
JelloHammer:	Now I can get a cool icon next to my name for once
KingofZeal:	For now, bits are all I've really gained
JelloHammer:	Oh that's good
KingofZeal:	Actual subs will be coming soon according to twitch
SuperGummying:	I will sub but not every month but I'll try like once three months
JelloHammer:	This sub being the actual subscribe option, or just the affiliates thing?
JelloHammer:	Of course
KingofZeal:	For obvious reasons
KingofZeal:	Anybody who subs will probably get more voting power in that vote though
JelloHammer:	Penelope emote sounds fine too
JelloHammer:	Channel specific yet familiar
KingofZeal:	But at the end of the day, I'll take the ideas I see frequently and then we'll probably do a run off vote when the time comes
JelloHammer:	It seemed like a normalized emote
JelloHammer:	I voted for an EyanKappa
KingofZeal:	Lightning has already wanted to advocate for a penelope emote
SuperGummying:	I didn't really know a lot about them
KingofZeal:	It's fine if you didn't, the question is to only fish for ideas
JelloHammer:	cuz I ❤ everyone
JelloHammer:	I rated all 4 of the guys a 5
SuperGummying:	I didn't really say anything with sub emotes
JelloHammer:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	The key points I was looking for that were ignored in the last one was social media usage, evaluation of people other than me, stream times, sub emotes,  and some of the misc. stuff
JelloHammer:	But I would still say that it is a good survey
JelloHammer:	Though tbh, I have pretty much taken this survey like 5 times already, so I know what to expect lol
JelloHammer:	Its more concise than the previous ones
JelloHammer:	You honestly did a good job with this one
SuperGummying:	Yup I think you did
KingofZeal:	k, in terms of a stream survey, do you guys think I covered everything important.  I feel like I'm forgetting something but I don't know what it is, lol
JelloHammer:	Done with mine
SuperGummying:	Alright Eyan I'm done
willofd2011:	Done lol
superheronerd:	That is a very difficult question haha
Kireina:	seperating them into current and All-time xd
Kireina:	I always answer those questions in a two-part
JelloHammer:	I suppose it would be a toss-up between Bastion and Portal 2
KingofZeal:	lol
JelloHammer:	I need to look through my steam lol
JelloHammer:	jesus thats a hard question
JelloHammer:	"Whats your favourite video game"
KingofZeal:	Then I'll post it to twitter/message board tomorrow after reviewing it one more time
Kireina:	oki
SuperGummying:	I'll do it
SuperGummying:	Alright
KingofZeal:	Tell me if I need to make any adjustments or if you think there is any potential questions that I should ask that I didn't ask
willofd2011:	Okie dokie ^w^
SuperGummying:	Someone link it
JelloHammer:	kk
KingofZeal:	Go to my twitch channel, access it through the info area, and fill it out
SuperGummying:	I'm too lazy to
JelloHammer:	Link it and I'll test it out
KingofZeal:	I want you all to go test it out for me
JelloHammer:	Ah cool
KingofZeal:	I've put together a new survey
JelloHammer:	I'm on my PC

Dragonite:	to be fair it doesn't have the same ring as "the cabbage curse"
Lightning:	and in a single night the bevel meme was birthed and killed
Deci:	it's "reducing the edge of a corner

KingofZeal:	That I make a lot of trash before getting to something that is less trash
Deci:	I can read it too, but it's hard to read

wolverale12:	I don't think it would be a good idea for me to drink alcohol also since my dads side of the family has alcohol problems (not my dad, he doesn't drink for that reason)
Neon Strike Kitty:	but I think they're full of it
Dragonite:	(◡‿  ◡✿)
Neon Strike Kitty:	my parents say it's legal for me to drink
Dragonite:	i drink copious amounts of water
wolverale12:	I don't drink either

Neon Strike Kitty:	I just don't see any benefit from consuming alcohol
Kireina:	well in the aspect for actually drinking
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~now get on mah level~~

Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm just not interested in alcohol
willofd2011:	I just don't drink in general lol

Kireina:	d
Master9000:	you insisted that we go to nexus and died 6 more times for it
Kireina:	x
SuperGummying:	so fair enough
SuperGummying:	and you
SuperGummying:	i lost to sweden and russia
SuperGummying:	im pretty sure it's even master
Master9000:	dual monitor not OP enough
KingofZeal:	But it ain't really working
Master9000:	you cant just brush everything off as not your fault <@199725993416589313>
KingofZeal:	I'm trying to do both
MajesticEclipse02:	be greatful to the king
KingofZeal:	But not really
KingofZeal:	I mean, technically it is RM
MajesticEclipse02:	he chooses us over work
Kireina:	CHUSA
SuperGummying:	hey it's not my fault it was in the way
Kireina:	Also Dreamhacksmash holy shit man JESUS
Master9000:	this IS productive eyan
KingofZeal:	You know, I've spent a good hour or so talking to you guys when I could be productive
Master9000:	React™
Kireina:	and didn't care
Kireina:	Almost run over a cat
Kireina:	Never react
SuperGummying:	what did i do?
Kireina:	Shh
Master9000:	<@!116347313080762372> theres reactions for a reason
MajesticEclipse02:	pancakes
KingofZeal:	#pointproven
SuperGummying:	panda you can't fight me
MajesticEclipse02:	no, the real attraction here is
Kireina:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Deci:	We all know I'm the main attraction
Kireina:	That ain't even a factor but OK
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well, brb
Deci:	Let's go with that
MajesticEclipse02:	wow
KingofZeal:	#myegostillain'tasbigasdeci's
Deci:	Bahahahaha , yeah, sure

Kireina:	Give me the word
Kireina:	I'm ready to fight gummy for you
SuperGummying:	told you so
SuperGummying:	see
SuperGummying:	see deci
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wasn't in a mood to appreciate anything this morning
Deci:	I'm worried you had that ready zek
SuperGummying:	i didn't run over that cat
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eh
Master9000:	~~winning~~
KingofZeal:	Mind you, that's not to say you can't use them, just that you'll generally skip them for rifles
Deci:	So Ida, did you appreciate our pins?
Zek:	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/174746884039114755/306908994663088138/image.jpg
SuperGummying:	well there goes my winning strategy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I like knights
Master9000:	rektified
Kireina:	LUL
SuperGummying:	......
Kireina:	The instant Gummy counter
Deci:	Ban
KingofZeal:	Very skippable military unit
Kireina:	rip
MajesticEclipse02:	^
Master9000:	oof
KingofZeal:	Muskets are terrible in civ 5 btw
Master9000:	not really
SuperGummying:	muskets are better
MajesticEclipse02:	hah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I have laser turrets
Master9000:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	Musket warfare isn't relevant
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> have you not heard my singnig?
Master9000:	its not relevant
MajesticEclipse02:	excuse you ?
Deci:	ALL MUST BE SILENT BEFORE THE MAESTRO OF MUSIC
SuperGummying:	do you?
SuperGummying:	hell no you don't know the first thing about musket warfare
MajesticEclipse02:	yes
SuperGummying:	no
SuperGummying:	woah woah woah woah
KingofZeal:	Yes, I did, just covering bases
Master9000:	i only noticed because it gave me a switch to push to talk notification
MajesticEclipse02:	gummy there's an issue lol i'm always napoleon
Kireina:	lol
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> did u disable voice activity for gurus in music? im pretty sure thats not necessary if u already disabled speaking
SuperGummying:	the only reason i chose civ 5 was napoleon
KingofZeal:	They usually patch 6 once a season, they had a winter and spring update
KingofZeal:	Civ 5 is finished in development so right now, it's arguably on par if not a better game than 6, but with time, 6  will surpass 5 easily.  Plus 5 is no longer receiving patches where as 6 still will get a lot of balance changes
MajesticEclipse02:	Hmm?
KingofZeal:	Civ 6 is fully out RM, but firaxis has a history of 2 expansions per release
SuperGummying:	i mean civ 5*
SuperGummying:	i may have to promise more people
SuperGummying:	i promise master and ida already
SuperGummying:	i can't afford to give people civ 6
Master9000:	is it still WIP?
KingofZeal:	Just so ya'll are aware, though I think civ 5 is better right now, civ 6 in the long run will be infinitely better for multiplayer
KingofZeal:	Cause you can make alliances
Master9000:	remember thats the commies in Cold War
KingofZeal:	Civ 6 actually makes the ally system a bit better
MajesticEclipse02:	and that's the complications for ww1 lol
Master9000:	i meant the warsaw pact gummy
SuperGummying:	ahhh the grand duchy of warsaw
KingofZeal:	If somebody declares war on you, your defensive pact allies will auto declare war on the person who declared on you
SuperGummying:	?
Master9000:	warsaw/nato
KingofZeal:	You can also sign defensive pacts
MajesticEclipse02:	whats happening ??
Master9000:	<@199725993416589313> why tf is that picture of yourself that you sent us earlier in fucking 3024x4032?
KingofZeal:	You can choose to make declaration of friendships in civ 5
SuperGummying:	of course you can have allies right?
SuperGummying:	if he has the game
SuperGummying:	maybe blitz
SuperGummying:	i'll ask bella and anyone else who may want to join
SuperGummying:	okay 4 people
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	i'll invade you
SuperGummying:	you can be that
SuperGummying:	fine ida can be that
Master9000:	im over here tho
SuperGummying:	yeah i like that lol
SuperGummying:	hmmm i wonder if i take over master's country i will call it the confederation of the gum
SuperGummying:	
SuperGummying:	this is the true map
SuperGummying:	but master
SuperGummying:	i never played this game before
Master9000:	rip
Tatsumaki:	🔥 **I can't talk to you right now, sorry!** (Cleverbot started charging for their botspeak API) 🔥
Master9000:	<@!172002275412279296> have you ever played age of empires the age of the kings for DS?
Neon Strike Kitty:	but it's a ton of fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah
KingofZeal:	To be fair, Civ is actually pretty hard
Master9000:	probably
Neon Strike Kitty:	I feel like Gummy's never played this game before
KingofZeal:	Unless you conquer his lands and make them puppet cities
Master9000:	
Kireina:	rip
SuperGummying:	darn
Neon Strike Kitty:	You don't know how the world will be generated, though
KingofZeal:	You can only do puppet states in civ 4
SuperGummying:	okay first fo all i'll make dragonite's country a puppet state
Kireina:	xd
Master9000:	and guess where i am in all this
Master9000:	sounds about right
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'll basically be like Switzerland, but Swedish
SuperGummying:	you were suppose to have faith in me
Master9000:	yeah i meant switzerland not sweden derp
SuperGummying:	but you and bella didn't have faith in me
SuperGummying:	okay maybe i lost
Master9000:	wait shit i think im messing up the countries
Master9000:	nobody fucks with sweden
SuperGummying:	and tamed russia
Master9000:	no you didnt
SuperGummying:	i crush sweden
Master9000:	yes she will
SuperGummying:	just ask master, bella or blitz yesterday
SuperGummying:	ida you won't win against my muskets
Deino Mite:	See, I'm just gonna just sit on defense and defeat anyone who attacks me.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't wait for Gummy to get defeated by barbarians
SuperGummying:	ida will surrender fast
SuperGummying:	dude my invasion play will only last for 10 days
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	napoleon brought food for 30 days
SuperGummying:	for 60 days
SuperGummying:	i'll bring food
Master9000:	too late
SuperGummying:	i won't make the same mistake
Master9000:	the one that ended horrifically for the invaders?
SuperGummying:	just like the french invasion of russia
Master9000:	dont tell him ida
SuperGummying:	looks like i will
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's the beauty of my strategy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not going to invade
Neon Strike Kitty:	But, the thing is
Master9000:	world war 4 technology <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
SuperGummying:	when you invade
SuperGummying:	so i can have buffers
SuperGummying:	im going to put my captial further back
Neon Strike Kitty:	so you declare war on me and piss half the planet off
Master9000:	remember that constantinope fell in  29 May 1453 not 23 and Vesuvious erupted in 79 not 93 BCE
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm going to befriend all the citystates
SuperGummying:	use sticks as a weapon?
SuperGummying:	what are you going to do?
SuperGummying:	and master
Master9000:	i keep on thinking all the important  dates ending in 9 end in 3
Master9000:	ooh nice
SuperGummying:	bella check pm later
superheronerd:	Brb. Food from heaven time
SuperGummying:	you wanna play?
Master9000:	>Gummy's ~~likely~~ will definitely not update his army 
FTFY
SuperGummying:	dragonite
Neon Strike Kitty:	and what their playstyle is
SuperGummying:	k i may ask other people
Neon Strike Kitty:	Depends on who it is
SuperGummying:	hey ida you don't mind if we get more people to join right?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy's likely to not update his army
Kireina:	LOL
Master9000:	unless we break time and use 21st century weapons while youre still medieval
SuperGummying:	you said something about muskets
Neon Strike Kitty:	I never agreed on muskets
Kireina:	Probably not
Neon Strike Kitty:	but it would be fun one day
KingofZeal:	lol
SuperGummying:	we agreed on muskets
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's why we're not doing a first game against you
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
KingofZeal:	None of you can win against me.  😛
Neon Strike Kitty:	and meet my paratroopers
SuperGummying:	i thought we were going to use muskets?
Master9000:	gummy scorched earth isnt gonna win you a nuclear war ffs
Neon Strike Kitty:	Let's see what happens when your warriors come to my kingdom
Kireina:	But none of my friends play it consitently enough <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Dragonite:	imma be back to annoy gummy at a later date
SuperGummying:	scorched earth policy
Neon Strike Kitty:	lol
SuperGummying:	i'll crush you
Master9000:	i dont have it yet wahoo
SuperGummying:	ida i don't need a lesson
Kireina:	I'd be happy to play more civ If I had more people to play with / teach me xd
Neon Strike Kitty:	So I guess I gotta tutor the group in our game
MajesticEclipse02:	COLD WAR ???
SuperGummying:	but i do have it
KingofZeal:	For the record, I have no problems streaming Civ
SuperGummying:	i never play civ before as well
SuperGummying:	i never said just napoleon you forgot stalin
MajesticEclipse02:	^
KingofZeal:	@midnightbella Civ is super addicitive but it takes a bit of a time investment to learn.  It's intimidating for new players.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm a bit of a fan of Celtic and Norse mythology. Barely know anything but I like it.
Master9000:	not everything is about napoleon dammit gummy
SuperGummying:	we talk about all the time
MajesticEclipse02:	personally i enjoyed my greek and roman unit
SuperGummying:	master knows
SuperGummying:	history is fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	The pyramids were built in France, that's a fact now
KingofZeal:	❤
MajesticEclipse02:	history is fun depending on the subject
KingofZeal:	Unless you play Civilization 4 with the mod Rhye's and Fall.  Then it really inspires you to learn history
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> when did constantinople fall?
superheronerd:	Sounds really fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	*throws Brave Shine*
Kireina:	you can get Civ 5 w/ all Expansions for $12
superheronerd:	Gotcha
KingofZeal:	I also love history as a subject, not that you get much of that from Civ, but still fun
Kireina:	If Civ does another Mega Sale
Neon Strike Kitty:	Funnily enough, even with all the dlc and off sale, Civ 5 is half as expensive as games in stores here
MajesticEclipse02:	i'm out of this conversation
MajesticEclipse02:	darn nevermind, i have no expansions for 5 lol
KingofZeal:	Super fun series
KingofZeal:	Unfortunately, civ 5 is still probably a slightly better game as it has expansions and is more complete
Master9000:	a world where gummy listens to people with logic
SuperGummying:	all of your advice messes me up
Neon Strike Kitty:	Generally, don't try finishing a Civ game in one sitting
SuperGummying:	dragonite in what world would i listen to you?
KingofZeal:	Although civ 6 added online speed, and it's a total blessing
Master9000:	go ahead tho
Dragonite:	welp
Neon Strike Kitty:	RIP Drago
Master9000:	yes you did <@137336478291329024>
KingofZeal:	Civ takes fairly long
superheronerd:	I've never played
Dragonite:	dammit, did i miss a conversation about how Gummy never listens to advice?
Ayana:	​you mean ci(v^2)?
superheronerd:	Civ is the one that takes a really long time right?
MajesticEclipse02:	what about civ V ???
KingofZeal:	I'm pretty rusty on civ 5 though cause been mostly playing 6
Master9000:	and the counter to it is still not chasing singed
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've played a few games with my cousin and I'm the most experienced of the group
Master9000:	tahts your policy for everything
SuperGummying:	plus buffer zones
KingofZeal:	I can play immortal with a fair ammount of confidence, still not confident on diety yet
SuperGummying:	don't worry my civ 5 plan is a scorched earth policy
Ayana:	​is that not treasonous to your own principles? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	that would actually be a bad idea since we don't want to get wiped out
KingofZeal:	It's one of the few series I'm willing to buy when it's not on sale
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~so maybe we should include you in our game~~
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's still not gone on sale
KingofZeal:	I'm like, a huge civfanatic, I own everything civ related that i care to own, lol
willofd2011:	Lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	then he's not getting you anything
SuperGummying:	i only said you two
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
KingofZeal:	I have civ 5, lol
SuperGummying:	no
Neon Strike Kitty:	He'll buy you civ 5 when it goes on sale
Master9000:	trust me ik
SuperGummying:	no i will not pay i will sub*
KingofZeal:	lol
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> HE WILL NOT PAY
superheronerd:	Dang.
SuperGummying:	Eyan mentor me pls, I'll like pay for real
willofd2011:	Not a clue lol
Deino Mite:	I haven't.
Master9000:	same
SuperGummying:	nope
KingofZeal:	That would be a no
superheronerd:	Have you folks ever heard of this place called the hat. I wanna know if it's as legendary outside of this area
Deino Mite:	I feel like Eyan would be a really good mentor.
Neon Strike Kitty:	brb
Master9000:	ok <@!214587785510780929> mind if i talk to gummy thru u <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
SuperGummying:	hey master you just need the right people to tell me
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> ive been telling him this for months and it just doesnt stick ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	inb4 gummy forgety
KingofZeal:	To be fair, listening to me is typically a wise choice.  😛
SuperGummying:	see guys i do listen
SuperGummying:	thats two people i listen to
SuperGummying:	alright i'll listening to eyan
Master9000:	i just post stuff so i dont lose it or to save storage space most of the time
Neon Strike Kitty:	Take it from someone who knows, if you don't take it from us
KingofZeal:	*cough*shellofformerself*cough*
Neon Strike Kitty:	^
KingofZeal:	Tbh, you should never treat it like a job, that's when it goes downhill.  I speak from experience
SuperGummying:	for some reason
Master9000:	a lot
SuperGummying:	but i ignore you two
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't treat it like a job, since it's not getting you any money
SuperGummying:	lol
SuperGummying:	but i ended up listening to bella
SuperGummying:	i mean i know call it a hobby though it took like 5 people to tell me that
Master9000:	note <@199725993416589313> it can be both
KingofZeal:	But for now, it's a hobby
KingofZeal:	At one point I did call it a job, and I'd like to be able to call it that again
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy should follow your example
SuperGummying:	really?
KingofZeal:	Techincally, I call what I do a hobby
SuperGummying:	maybe ida
SuperGummying:	just not from master
Neon Strike Kitty:	lies
Master9000:	idk why ~~we~~ I still bother with him tbh <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
SuperGummying:	no i learn
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy just never learns
Master9000:	gummy doesnt get that part tho
SuperGummying:	hmmm they keep telling me that
willofd2011:	Lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yep
Master9000:	it is
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	The term you guys are looking for is hobby
SuperGummying:	welp
KingofZeal:	For the record
Master9000:	and youre dealing with a terrible exchange rate right now
Neon Strike Kitty:	and if you're spending more than you earn it's not a job
Neon Strike Kitty:	Remember Gummy, time is money
Neon Strike Kitty:	^
Master9000:	$.01 isnt a livable amount
KingofZeal:	Not that I plan on really having any major content aside from maybe talking during ad breaks
Deino Mite:	and you were the first youtuber i watched and the only streamer i watched so its safe to say i support you
Master9000:	its true tho
SuperGummying:	i got my pay check yesterday
SuperGummying:	ida don't say that
KingofZeal:	And if you sub, you get to skip ads
Deino Mite:	i dont really mind watching ads if its supporting a content creator i like
KingofZeal:	Basically
Master9000:	like bathroom breaks between league games?
KingofZeal:	But I'll make them as unintrusive as I possibly can
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, your youtube work is not a job
Master9000:	not actually meaning "soon"
Master9000:	trademark
KingofZeal:	And I do plan to encorporate ad breaks into future broadcasts
Neon Strike Kitty:	>fired from your job
MajesticEclipse02:	TM feature ??
Master9000:	`:tm:`
KingofZeal:	Twitch said that is also a soon TM feature
SuperGummying:	Master I got fired from my job of course I need it
Master9000:	theyre very limited
KingofZeal:	As far as I'm aware, I do not get ad revenue atm
Neon Strike Kitty:	Can you make <:Dragonflair:305738685305847808> a sub emote?
Master9000:	no u dont gummy
Master9000:	oh right do u get money from ads now? <@!304073163669766158>
SuperGummying:	But I need to make a living too master
KingofZeal:	But I actually mean no ads, sub emote, etc.
SuperGummying:	Shhhhhhhhhh doesn't mean I know how it works
KingofZeal:	lol
KingofZeal:	I mean, if you want
Master9000:	<@199725993416589313> <:FailFish:305611995787296768> you have an account set up
Neon Strike Kitty:	<:KappaPride:305603580017246209>
Neon Strike Kitty:	A direct service?
MajesticEclipse02:	for subs i've always seen 5, i have no idea how patreon works however
SuperGummying:	I have no clue how patreon works
KingofZeal:	However, I can actually provide a direct service for subs
KingofZeal:	They are
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think patreon donations are more beneficial, then
KingofZeal:	That's probably somewhat accurate
Master9000:	i heard someone say a while ago it was like $3
KingofZeal:	I don't actually know the specifics as I do not have subs, lol
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> what part of the $5 from a sub do u get, for reference
Deino Mite:	i dont really watch any other streamers so you will get all my bits
Master9000:	its simple intentionally but it makes the pricing indirect so that twitch still makes a profit
KingofZeal:	I earn 1 cent per bit
MajesticEclipse02:	i gave you a nickel lol
KingofZeal:	For the streamer, yes
SuperGummying:	I probably will sub tbh but I can't promise I will be able to each month
Master9000:	with Kappa's
MajesticEclipse02:	each bit is a cent ?
KingofZeal:	Namely we fill the cup of the gods
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, how do I watch ads
KingofZeal:	There's twitchalert apps for bits that are cool
Master9000:	lag
Master9000:	uhh wtf
KingofZeal:	Although you should save your bits for streams
KingofZeal:	Yes, 5 cents
MajesticEclipse02:	i gave 5 bits lol does that count for anything ?
KingofZeal:	And twitch subs are something that will (when actually enabled) matter a lot to me
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've said before that I don't like Twitch
SuperGummying:	But that's a lot and my parents do monitor my credit card
Neon Strike Kitty:	But that's the one that matters to me
SuperGummying:	I honestly want to sub to you every month
Deino Mite:	i want to sub, but i need to save money for my Japan trip so...
KingofZeal:	Not to YouTube Ida
Master9000:	the sub and discord nitro are probably the only reason for me to get a job and a credit card tbh
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm already subbed
SuperGummying:	I mean
Master9000:	true lmao
KingofZeal:	It'd mean the world to me if all my long time regulars actually subbed, but obviously if you can't, you can't and it's no big deal.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy doesn't know about the time=money since he will literally spend months of work for a cent
Master9000:	magicians are time travelers confirmed
SuperGummying:	Meh I'll see in the future if I want to sub or something
Master9000:	so time is magic
Master9000:	but time=money
Neon Strike Kitty:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
KingofZeal:	Thus money = magic
KingofZeal:	The only thing that seperates the enlightened of zeal is that they can use magic
Master9000:	money is where actual labor comes in not just clicking watch ad every once in a while
Deino Mite:	guess i cant use bits to achieve enlightenment. its ironic really. the enlightened ones are those who seek knowledge through great labor, but watching ads to earn bits requires labor and that cant get you enlightenment. the only thing that can is money, which everyone eventually falls victim to
Master9000:	because you told me not to tell you to do that
SuperGummying:	Master why did you tell me to do a winter map?
Master9000:	yeah thats why u only have 1 thats the joke
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just hit 13
Master9000:	and then theres ida with
SuperGummying:	Well an even better game is Napoleon Total War but the Russians hate me
Master9000:	a ton of people are close to leveling up rn
superheronerd:	I like its humor. Would've missed it by a mile as a kid
Kireina:	>:v
Neon Strike Kitty:	bugger off, mee6
KingofZeal:	Earthbound is one of many things that still triggers me.  I'm such a mentally broken person, lol
SuperGummying:	^^^
SuperGummying:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not interested in Earthbound, it creeps me out
Master9000:	watching ads cant be a job <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Kireina:	So fun so trippy
Master9000:	bamboozled again
SuperGummying:	Earthbound looks fun
Deino Mite:	dang it!
superheronerd:	Earthbound is addictive as heck
Kireina:	no
KingofZeal:	No
Deino Mite:	am i able to sub using bits?
Deino Mite:	if i work hard enough for bits, i dont have to spend any real money
KingofZeal:	It's easier to hook up discord to just auto enlighten people from subs/patrons
Kireina:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kireina:	What you mean Earthbound was terrible
Kireina:	You wanna fight dog
SuperGummying:	I might donate
Kireina:	woah woah woah
KingofZeal:	I don't plan on having donations be hooked up to enlightenment, just an fyi
Master9000:	will you tolerate spending 60$ a year to change that?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*shot*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Earthbound was a terrible game!
Deino Mite:	i will not tolerate being earthbound
Master9000:	and hes not even on the server
KingofZeal:	I earned 30 bucks in bits the other day, granted, half of that was Wolverale
Master9000:	the ads are glitched for me <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Deino Mite:	ill earn them and use those to become an enlightened one
KingofZeal:	1 bit = 1 cent for the streamer
KingofZeal:	You can buy them with money, or earn them in small quantities from watching ads
superheronerd:	Oh really?
KingofZeal:	Bits are more or less a twitch currancy for donating to streamers
Master9000:	brb
KingofZeal:	#sellout
Master9000:	@wolv oh hes not on here rip
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
KingofZeal:	They pay my bills
Neon Strike Kitty:	5 is a bit much >.>
Deino Mite:	what do bits do?
Master9000:	donating $5 a month works? wolverale should have it for 3 months from those 1500 bits
SuperGummying:	Yes panda my airship armada
KingofZeal:	And obviously subs still aren't a thing
KingofZeal:	Enlightened is gonna be for subs/patrons.  Still gotta hook some of that stuff up
Neon Strike Kitty:	No, screw bits
Deino Mite:	ya ill donate a bit
Master9000:	you mean a bit?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I demand my enlightened status
Neon Strike Kitty:	*donated a penny*
Master9000:	<@191299047896776704> thats for subs i think, idk if hes planning on doing something with bits related to that but patreon should also work
superheronerd:	earthbound!
Master9000:	does anyone here know *Inherit the Wind*?
Deino Mite:	wait, why are we all earthbound? we are your devoted zealians. we should be enlightened ones
Master9000:	same
KingofZeal:	I'm pretty distracted, derp
KingofZeal:	Also, oh
KingofZeal:	Yeah that too
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I was answering
Neon Strike Kitty:	Majestic asked how many palaces
Kireina:	The Airship
Kireina:	But but
KingofZeal:	As for how many places there are in Zeal which somebody asked, 3 palace type structures, the Ocean palace, an earthbound village, the mountain of woe, and a few other shrine type stuff
Neon Strike Kitty:	I know it exists, I was just
Kireina:	till you have finished
Master9000:	ok time to queue up song dubs again then
Kireina:	I will sit here sustaining all of your dank memes
KingofZeal:	Zeal palace exists already Ida, it's just restricted access
Kireina:	I am a man who waits
Kireina:	You brought it upon yourself
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
Kireina:	no too lazy
Master9000:	i just cleared queue
Kireina:	I'm just waiting till you get to 50
Master9000:	i mean again
Kireina:	you uploaded like 200+ songs
Kireina:	wtf did you think I did
Master9000:	queue it up panda
Kireina:	I would if there wasn't like 200 songs
Master9000:	you want to listen to some stuff too?
Kireina:	cause jesus man
Kireina:	Seriously though like could you get through your playlist anytime soon
MajesticEclipse02:	huh
Master9000:	you dont
Kireina:	lol
SuperGummying:	How do I get rid of your playlist?
Neon Strike Kitty:	<@243165550874722314> Well, I think the two important ones are Zeal Palace and Ocean Palace
Master9000:	go queue it up in camelot
Master9000:	i dont
SuperGummying:	Master I want weeb music
Master9000:	30 seconds at most
SuperGummying:	How fast was that?
Master9000:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
SuperGummying:	Okay I give up
SuperGummying:	Let me figure it out
Master9000:	?
SuperGummying:	I'm keeping you out of the admin voice thing for real now
Master9000:	that wasnt `/tts`
Master9000:	no you didnt
SuperGummying:	I heard that
Master9000:	also still waiting for the publication of that chapter on war and treason to keep gummy down <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Master9000:	its better than not being productive at all tho
MajesticEclipse02:	how many palaces are there ?
KingofZeal:	Discord as it is right now is basically the result of "oh god I need to set this up quickly cause I can't keep delaying the server."  There's plenty I'd still like to do here.
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's good news
KingofZeal:	I plan on utilizing most of the places of zeal for channels eventually
Neon Strike Kitty:	The Ocean Palace channel could be an addition one day
MajesticEclipse02:	*listens to super mario theme... then five seconds later jumps up and punches hole into ceiling*
Master9000:	<:Youwere:305566803038568449> <:Treason:305563730056314880> <:NotYet:305743469408944131> <:HelloThere:305560404715896832> <:Ironic:307345212328509442> are all from there
Deino Mite:	ok
Master9000:	dewit
Deino Mite:	no i have not yet set foot in that land
SuperGummying:	Alright master what were we talking about yesterday?
Deino Mite:	you have taught me well in the way of memes master
Master9000:	do you go to r/prequelmemes as well?
Master9000:	goood
Deino Mite:	i travel there often
Master9000:	https://reddit.com/r/dankmemes
Master9000:	let me send you to a magical place
Deino Mite:	with a dank memes channel though, we could increase the presence of the memes greatly
Master9000:	there is trace amounts of dankness
Deino Mite:	true
Master9000:	even here and now
Master9000:	like the force
Master9000:	in everything
Master9000:	the memes are everywhere
Master9000:	nah its the internet connection that is the necessity
KingofZeal:	uhhuh
Deino Mite:	eyan, do you not understand that memes are the sustaining force of all internet dwellers? for normal people, they require food to live. for us, it is memes
KingofZeal:	Maybe, but it's not on my priorities list
KingofZeal:	Not sure if I'd call it a necessity
Master9000:	lmao
Deino Mite:	but it should be a necessity
Deino Mite:	ya
Master9000:	thats probably the farthest out of sight thing rn lol
Deino Mite:	are you going to add a dank memes channel to this server?
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
Master9000:	2 mins to get an icon from thought to server wooo
MajesticEclipse02:	pancakes
KingofZeal:	I'll probably consult you on the music thing when I feel like it, it's really low priority as far as I'm concerned.  I'll be reorganizing the channels when I want to be productive but don't want to exert large amounts of energy thinking
Master9000:	oh yeah what did u have in mind for song request day and talking to you directly channels?
KingofZeal:	As well as tweak pretty much everything pertaining to the buttons at the bottom of my twitch channel, aka, new survey, update social media sites, etc. etc.
KingofZeal:	Also want to organize this discord server some more now that I have a better idea what I'm doing
KingofZeal:	The final thing being my stream overlays which have basically not been a thing for the last half year
Deino Mite:	good luck on that
KingofZeal:	That's my next major design overhaul that I'll probably work on
Deino Mite:	alright
KingofZeal:	I haven't made any decisions yet on twitch alerts stuff
Deci:	Not my point. I wasn't performing at a level I was happy with on her. Thus I'm continuing practicing
Deino Mite:	she works great for me
Deino Mite:	are you gonna use miku for donation/subscribe/cheer aler?
Deci:	She wasn't working for me.
Deci:	I'm making sure to practice her further before I take her back into ranked
Deino Mite:	i got mastery 7 yesterday
KingofZeal:	Well, everyone says things look cool.  I shall deem my redesign a success.  I just need to do the seasons for the buttons and then figure out what design to spend 3 days being pissed at next
Deci:	I'm mastery 5 atm
Deino Mite:	it looks really cool
KingofZeal:	Those banner designs have been in my files for a while, I tweaked them a lot in the redesign though.  The winter one was the one I overhauled most, so happy with the snow effect
Deino Mite:	yo deci, what mastery are you on xayah?
superheronerd:	The banners are really pretty
Deci:	Great*
Master9000:	especially since tmodloader doesnt work with 1.3.5.2
Deci:	Those banners look greater
KingofZeal:	Not even sure what I'm doing with Terraria at this point
KingofZeal:	Not a clue
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> how much of what youre gonna have me build in terraria is gonna be in the clouds? <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Master9000:	snoflakes
Deino Mite:	can definitely see the seasons in them
KingofZeal:	The winter one is my pride and joy
Deino Mite:	those look really cool
SuperGummying:	I like the winter one a lot
KingofZeal:	That's the four banners for the channel based on season
SuperGummying:	Bleh weebs
KingofZeal:	
KingofZeal:	
KingofZeal:	
KingofZeal:	
superheronerd:	Sounds awesome
Deino Mite:	i will miss all the cute anime girls on the banners though
Deino Mite:	ok
KingofZeal:	Once you have another season to compare it to, you'll get it
KingofZeal:	The spring feel is supposed to come from everything working together
Deino Mite:	but that might be because i just cant tell what the background of all the banners is
Master9000:	this one
KingofZeal:	Seems silly to dedicate space to something that's relatively redundant
Deino Mite:	it looks nice, although i didnt get an initial spring vibe form it
Master9000:	remember when  a little tab for it popped up the first time?
KingofZeal:	They basically amount to "don't be an asshole" anyways
SuperGummying:	Oh okay
KingofZeal:	So now when somebody new tunes in, they agree to the rules of the chat
KingofZeal:	Twitch has a rules feature now
Master9000:	they are part of the chat
KingofZeal:	Oh, no
SuperGummying:	Don't you need to put them in your twitch description?
Neon Strike Kitty:	#1: Ignore Gummy's advice
KingofZeal:	What about them
SuperGummying:	What about chat rules?
Zek:	sass
Master9000:	brb recommending that even tho its not gonna happen
KingofZeal:	Hmm?
Master9000:	now im guessing you want to add textures to discord role colors
SuperGummying:	Colours look nice
KingofZeal:	I used to have seasonal offline screens, I decided to just make the whole channel that way with this redesign cause I like the seasons and consider it important to me.  Plus I think it looks cool as hell for long time viewers
Neon Strike Kitty:	but this is cool
Master9000:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was thinking of seasons like season 1
KingofZeal:	I'm designing the channel to be seasonal, notice how there is an apparent spring theme going on?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh
Master9000:	*is jealous because he cant do that in MS Paint* <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	Seasons?
KingofZeal:	The rest is basically just recoloring everything and tacking on a different image behind the subject
superheronerd:	I love the colors
KingofZeal:	It's extremely easy to do the other seasons though, the hard part was the initial design.
KingofZeal:	Haven't done them yet
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> are u still working on the other 3 seasons or are they already done as well?
JelloHammer:	Pretty neatly organized. I like it <@!304073163669766158>
Master9000:	the fridge is empty
Master9000:	the only thing i can see is protein bars so thats what im eating lmao
MajesticEclipse02:	*doesn't eat because can't find anything*
willofd2011:	*goes to rewrite certain chapters*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dinner is the most exciting thing in my near future
Neon Strike Kitty:	*continues to wait for dinner*
KingofZeal:	I like to think it was worth, just wish it didn't take me 3-4 days to come up with a design, lol
MajesticEclipse02:	*continues to lurk*
Master9000:	*goes back to quoting a movie adaptation of a book because he forgot the book at school*
Kireina:	*goes back to watching anime*
MajesticEclipse02:	worth it though right ?
Master9000:	theres a bird outside sitting right in view under where my monitor stand's hole is from my pov lmao
KingofZeal:	Making things from scratch that look good is hard.  v_v
KingofZeal:	Alright, it was a fickle little thing to work with
Kireina:	updated on mobile and got spooked LOL
Master9000:	^
Kireina:	oh yeh thats way easier to read
Kireina:	If only you could ctrl+z your life
KingofZeal:	Take a look and tell me if that's better
KingofZeal:	k, made a text adjustment on only the biography section
Kireina:	rip
willofd2011:	I think I may have accidentally deleted an important file that had quite a few documents cause I can't find them anywhere <:BibleThump:305806695999995904>
Neon Strike Kitty:	https://giphy.com/gifs/dream-goals-believe-3oEjHPUyNPSIp3anZu
Neon Strike Kitty:	We believe in you!
Neon Strike Kitty:	Cool
KingofZeal:	Links aren't hooked up yet because part of the overhaul is doing other stuff that those links pertain to, aka, making a new survey, redoing some stuff, etc. etc.
Kireina:	LOL
Neon Strike Kitty:	or b) Eyan gaining two dollars
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, I think tomorrow I'm either gonna get an email about a) my card being denied
KingofZeal:	in regards to the survey
KingofZeal:	yes
Master9000:	and the 2-3 column setup is designed really well
MajesticEclipse02:	like hey it's even in spacing and it's columized
Master9000:	is the survey tab going to have a link to the survey?
MajesticEclipse02:	i see
KingofZeal:	And be perfectish
KingofZeal:	Yea, I spent an hour or so figuring out a way to get the dimensions for everything to fit 1/2/3 columns
MajesticEclipse02:	love the organization, satisfies my ocd lol
Kireina:	I put a bunch of screenshots of what it looks like on mobile in the bot channel
Neon Strike Kitty:	Looks fine to me
KingofZeal:	It's really really hard to make the text pop more without making it look kinda ugly, but gimme a second, I'll see if I can make it better
Master9000:	4th paragraph down left side,  the colors are similar and a bit unpleasant to read
Neon Strike Kitty:	Alright, cool
KingofZeal:	Yes, but I don't have the links set up yet
Neon Strike Kitty:	Is the Donate banner meant to link to something?
KingofZeal:	Which spots are hard to read
Master9000:	the design is nice but slightly difficult to read on a few spots
KingofZeal:	Obviously, like everything, season dependent
Kinesis (Aaron):	Looks pretty good
willofd2011:	That looks awesome ^w^
KingofZeal:	I've been wracking my brain over the layout for 3 days now.  v_v  Finally got something I don't hate, lol
Master9000:	ooh looks nice
Neon Strike Kitty:	*throws feedback*
willofd2011:	What's up lol ^w^
KingofZeal:	Go look at my twitch channel, check out the info area, feedback pls
Master9000:	<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>

Aqua033:	I played a good bit of it at launch and I still have little to nothing to make a meta deck
Aqua033:	If you step away from it for any period of time, you're screwed unless you throw down tons of money
Neon Strike Kitty:	Tatsu's got good timing, as usual
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Awua033 leveled up!**
Aqua033:	I can't stand Hearthstone
Neon Strike Kitty:	it wasn't even close, I just got rekt. Even with a 1 turn advantage as Rogue.

Neon Strike Kitty:	So, I discovered that I'm absolute garbage at Hearthstone today
Kireina:	That's mean
Kireina:	Why are you kicking me gummy
SuperGummying:	*kicks Dragonite*
Dragonite:	/me uses a dragon shout on gummy's face

superheronerd:	Huzzah?
SuperGummying:	No they don't
Dragonite:	well now they do
SuperGummying:	But you are a Viking and you where spike leggings

SuperGummying:	You missed voice chat

Aqua033:	I've personally liked Greek history more
SuperGummying:	and roman weapons
Master9000:	along with the engineering of their bathing systems
superheronerd:	The colosseum is pretty amazing
SuperGummying:	Roman Empire
superheronerd:	Oooh Rome
Aqua033:	PFFT
I was scouting boss on Medivh
The other team was doing boss
So I decided to contest
1v3
I came out with all my Q stacks, a boss, and the game
Master9000:	Eyan if we're talking about a 24 hour building commitment, this chat proves that beauty being built in a day, obviously not counting time to plan
Kugallyblitz:	i was very sleep deprived
Kugallyblitz:	i would have said good night on last nights stream but I fell asleep for the last 40 minutes
VortexOA:	i missed all the streams -.-
Kugallyblitz:	yes hang on'
SuperGummying:	Also could you check pm
SuperGummying:	Eyan burnt out so he won't be streaming today and tomorrow
Kugallyblitz:	lol, good
SuperGummying:	You didn't miss much
Kugallyblitz:	Would've been on sooner but had a friend over
SuperGummying:	Hey blitz
Kugallyblitz:	Hello everyone
Aqua033:	Wait nevermind
Aqua033:	Also, Romulus and Remus is funny to me
Aqua033:	Jesus
Deino Mite:	So, Romulus and Remus were the original founders of Rome. After a bunch of stuff regarding a she-wolf and crazy uncle that may or may not have happened cus mythology stuff, they decided to build a city together. However, they couldn't agree on where they wanted to build the city. Remus wanted it on Aventine Hill and Romulus wanted it on Palatine hill. Romulus then started building a wall around the Palatine Hill, but Remus mocked it and eventually jumped over it. Romulus got really upset and killed Remus cus that's just what you do when someone jumps over your wall. Romulus then had to build the city alone, which takes longer. However, a city is not complete without citizens so Romulus invited all the prisoners in Alba Longa to come live in his new city, which he named after himself, Rome. But, they were all men and men like women so they needed to get some. They invited the Sabine men to a festival, and while all the men were at the festival, all the men in Rome kidnapped a bunch of Sabine women which became known as The Rape of the Sabine Women. Now that Rome finally had citizens, it is truly a city. But, festivals take a long time to plan and its very difficult to kidnap people and bring them back to your newly founded city so the Romans weren't able to build Rome in a day.
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's difficult to build one house in a day. Imagine that but on a bigger scale.
Deino Mite:	ok
Aqua033:	Eh, why the hell not
Deino Mite:	well, its more complicated than that
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's a frickin city
Deino Mite:	do you want an answer to why Rome can't be built in a day? I'm a Latin scholar and I love explaining things about Latin and Rome and even Greece to people.
Aqua033:	Stealth heroes tilt me
MajesticEclipse02:	but if you've ever played AC the cutscenes say otherwise
MajesticEclipse02:	same zeal
Aqua033:	O-Okay
Neon Strike Kitty:	Dad's working on his makeup
Aqua033:	What
KingofZeal:	WHY CAN'T ROME BE BUILT IN A DAY, WHY MUST LOOKING BEAUTIFUL TAKE TIME
Aqua033:	Decameters
Aqua033:	Yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Deca's got something to do with the metric system, at least
Aqua033:	Nevermind
Aqua033:	Deca is also a latin root iirc
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was thinking of deca
MajesticEclipse02:	huh,
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh, yeah
Aqua033:	Also, yes it is
Aqua033:	Deci is the latin root for...10, I believe.
MajesticEclipse02:	isn't that the blizzard equivalent to leauge ?
Aqua033:	*By the way Medivh is the best mage*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think Deci is short for Decimate, potentially
Aqua033:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	Heroes of the Storm
MajesticEclipse02:	i'm confused what are you playing ?
Aqua033:	The Li Ming on the other team
Aqua033:	
MajesticEclipse02:	what?
Aqua033:	So I already know it's not.
Aqua033:	I was about to say I think I'm against Deci, because this Li Ming in HotS is named deci, but they suck.
Neon Strike Kitty:	^
Dragonite:	but burning everything is fun
MajesticEclipse02:	it was a fun experience
MajesticEclipse02:	i burned water once
Master9000:	Not burning everything constantly would help
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm also burned out >.<

MajesticEclipse02:	hey you got it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah, Majora's Mask
MajesticEclipse02:	don't you hate it when you walk outside and the moon falls on your neighbors house ?
willofd2011:	Sounds like a horrible feeling
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ever been stabbed in the head? I don't think it's a nice feeling.
willofd2011:	I get bad headaches over the summer
Neon Strike Kitty:	feels like I'm being stabbed
Neon Strike Kitty:	Like an actual splitting one
Neon Strike Kitty:	I get a headache in the cold
willofd2011:	If my leg doesn't hurt so much over the colder months then I would love winter lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	*is already there*
MajesticEclipse02:	We shall be there
KingofZeal:	Hey yaaaaaaaaaaa'll, gonna boot up stream if ya'll want to hang out.  Just going to be doing stream work and maybe a little Hearthstone for now but will play games after dinner.
Neon Strike Kitty:	and the spiders and bugs aren't in huge numbers yet
MajesticEclipse02:	I like winter and snow but it depends on how much snow there is
Deci:	Winter > all
Neon Strike Kitty:	I like spring because it's kind of warm but not too warm
Zek:	Fall > All
willofd2011:	Spring>Summer
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's when the spiders start seeking shelter indoors
Neon Strike Kitty:	I kind of don't like autumn
Deci:	but f*ck summer
Deci:	and so is autumn
Deci:	spring is fine
Neon Strike Kitty:	I at least want the spring
willofd2011:	Lol XD
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well when your entire life is snow then that's too much
Deci:	#SNOWFORDAYS
Deci:	NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH SNOW
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've kind of had enough of snow
Deci:	We love you, don't leave
Deci:	And we hate you /sarcasm
Aqua033:	I hate snow
willofd2011:	Lol

Neon Strike Kitty:	Even my current icon is a Lancer
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got a folder of pictures of him
Neon Strike Kitty:	Tell me about it
Deci:	Lancer is pretty hot
Deci:	XD
Neon Strike Kitty:	I care about Lancer
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't really care about the waifus
Deci:	Fate is the best waifu,  but the worst route in terms of story, IMO
Deci:	UBW is best route, but you end with second best waifu
willofd2011:	*still has yet to see snow in person*
Neon Strike Kitty:	I like UBW because it's Lancer's most prominent role
Deci:	Snow is WONDERFULL
MajesticEclipse02:	#coloradothings
MajesticEclipse02:	Good, because we have plenty
KingofZeal:	I most definitely love snow
Deci:	I wish I had some snow too
willofd2011:	Can I have some snow? Lol
Deci:	though you end up with third best waifu
MajesticEclipse02:	So eyan.... you like snow right ? Do you want to take it from me and rainy ?
Deci:	well, Second best
Deci:	Best route, IMO
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm in the middle of Heaven's Feel
Neon Strike Kitty:	❤
Deci:	also, Ida, good game choice
Neon Strike Kitty:	Is it bloody snowing?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*looks out window*

Rainy:	Whaddya know
SuperGummying:	Snow
Rainy:	Well huh
MajesticEclipse02:	i just checked the weather and yeah rainy was right, we might get flurries today
Deino Mite:	I can send you a link to that one too.
Deino Mite:	Don't think there will be. It's gonna be a story about a polyamorous relationship in a geometry class.
SuperGummying:	Make sure you add muskets in it
Deino Mite:	Kinda. It's suppose to be like mocking her fanfictions so...
SuperGummying:	Is it inappropriate?
Deino Mite:	We are now working together to make our own fanfiction and it's absolutely hilarious.
willofd2011:	Dang lol
Deino Mite:	I'm in a discord with a bunch of people in my grade and we someone's get in a call and read some of her fanfiction together to see how bad it is.
Deino Mite:	She bases all of her OCs off people in our class.
Deino Mite:	Sent it. She has a to. If different stories but that's the one she had us read in class.
SuperGummying:	Kk
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	oh boy
Deino Mite:	I'll PM you.
Deino Mite:	Ok
SuperGummying:	I kinda do
SuperGummying:	Yeah
Deino Mite:	Do you want a link to it?
SuperGummying:	How bad is it?
SuperGummying:	How um
Deino Mite:	Of us*
Deino Mite:	She asked a couple of during math class to review it for her. It's so bad it is now a meme among my grade. She thinks we all like it though because we keep talking about it. She doesn't realize it's ironic.
SuperGummying:	Did you read it pimaster?
Deino Mite:	Mines alright. I found out today that a girl in my class rights erotica fanfiction in her free time.
Kugallyblitz:	hows everyone's day goin
Deino Mite:	My favorite part of Latin is the Junior Classical League. It's a Latin club that is part of one giant Latin club from across the country called JCL.
Aqua033:	I hated French, though
Aqua033:	I like Latin from what I know about it
Kugallyblitz:	hey guys im back after important business
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Deino Mite leveled up!**
Deino Mite:	I was forced into Latin, but I then fell in love with it so I don't really mind.
Aqua033:	It ended up paying off in spades, though
Aqua033:	I was basically forced into French
Deino Mite:	I take Latin cus you're forced to take it 6-8 and then then only other options are French and Spanish. I don't care about French and Spanish.
Aqua033:	Yep
MajesticEclipse02:	Your school has Latin and chinese
SuperGummying:	So I'll be in and out
SuperGummying:	But she said don't be on your phone all class
Aqua033:	I woulda taken Latin if my school didn't offer Chinese
SuperGummying:	Nvm class is cancelled
Aqua033:	Yep
Deino Mite:	Aqua is also Latin for water.
Aqua033:	We must duplicate.
Deino Mite:	^
Aqua033:	There are a lot of Aqua
MajesticEclipse02:	Wha
Aqua033:	And it's also Azura's Japanese name in Fates
Aqua033:	There's also an Aqua in Konosuba
MajesticEclipse02:	Many things
Deino Mite:	What are we talking about?
Aqua033:	There's an Aqua thwre
MajesticEclipse02:	Nice, I just enjoyed eclipses and galaxy stuff so I made my name's majestic, royal, or serene eclipse
Aqua033:	I know
Neon Strike Kitty:	Play Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep
Aqua033:	I'm just Aqua because it was the name of a character I made in 4th grade, and I stuck with it
Aqua033:	I don't either
MajesticEclipse02:	There are very few wind elementals though, I'm Lord of the west wind so
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just realized that I don't have a RWBY OC
Aqua033:	CardsAgainstRemnant is a weird place.
Aqua033:	I'm a water elemental who's the son of a water elemental with tentacles and a wind elemental
Neon Strike Kitty:	Finally
SuperGummying:	......FIRE
MajesticEclipse02:	I luckily didn't have class but bye gummy

SuperGummying:	Fire
Neon Strike Kitty:	there's like a 100 elements
MajesticEclipse02:	Fire water earth and wind
SuperGummying:	Close enough
MajesticEclipse02:	There's 4 elements lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Neither is vampire
Aqua033:	Wait, death isn't an element
SuperGummying:	Um vampire
Aqua033:	Death?
MajesticEclipse02:	An earth ?
Neon Strike Kitty:	What kind of elemental, I mean
SuperGummying:	A cat?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Guess what I am :>
SuperGummying:	What am I?
MajesticEclipse02:	I'm a wind elemental lol
Aqua033:	I'm apparently a water elemental
MajesticEclipse02:	I'm only getting rain right now, not sure about snow
Rainy:	Apparently it might snow today up here
SuperGummying:	Cool
SuperGummying:	Rainy can make rain?
Rainy:	I'm trying
Neon Strike Kitty:	I should update my PBE client
MajesticEclipse02:	Oh rainy are you making it rain ? Because apparently we live in the same state lol
Aqua033:	Dammit, I was just about to say that
MajesticEclipse02:	Literally
KingofZeal:	I try my best
MajesticEclipse02:	best payment ever eyan, that's all I ever wanted
Neon Strike Kitty:	Can I get a raise in happiness?
Rainy:	I'm just a yordle with a hammer
KingofZeal:	And stuff like that
Neon Strike Kitty:	Your war tactics are honestly kind of bad
KingofZeal:	And happiness
Rainy:	I'm no hero
KingofZeal:	And friendship
SuperGummying:	Remember muskets
KingofZeal:	You're getting paid with honor and glory
SuperGummying:	Ida you seen my war tactics
MajesticEclipse02:	Who are acquainted
Neon Strike Kitty:	a "general"
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, sure
MajesticEclipse02:	Okay so citizens
SuperGummying:	I'm a general
Neon Strike Kitty:	We're not getting paid for this
MajesticEclipse02:	And just happen to know each other
SuperGummying:	I'm no soldier
Aqua033:	^
MajesticEclipse02:	If not friends then we're all soldiers who just work for eyan
SuperGummying:	Let's be nice
SuperGummying:	Whoa whoa ida
SuperGummying:	Lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	*removes Gummy from my friend list*
Aqua033:	That slowly went downward
SuperGummying:	No
Deci:	I think so
Aqua033:	Yep
MajesticEclipse02:	Well we're all friends here right ?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I guess that's why they're called that
Aqua033:	I feel a lot of sadness and disappointment in myself
Neon Strike Kitty:	I hear the wind on my windows
MajesticEclipse02:	Emotions are hard to conceal for some people, luckily I have an ability which allows me to suppress or conceal emotions and display only good ones, it's a useful ability but I have a friend who's able to see through it
Deci:	i only feel anger
SuperGummying:	Same
Aqua033:	Normally I try to act decently emotionless, but there are just some times where I just completely go off the roof with them
MajesticEclipse02:	And yeah I live in CO.
MajesticEclipse02:	Emotions are a powerful thing, I'm a mess right now as well so I know how you feel
Deci:	majestic, you're in colorado as well?
Deci:	we'll love you anyways
Deci:	That's fine aqua
Aqua033:	I get to be an emotional mess sometimes
Deci:	twitch chat, that is
MajesticEclipse02:	Huh, I live here to so it's weird
Deci:	It's been mentioned on stream and I think she's put it in chat
SuperGummying:	Gummy lives in Canada
Deci:	hasn't been much of a secret, so yeah
MajesticEclipse02:	Wait rainy lives in Colorado ?
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Deci leveled up!**
Deci:	rain is there? I thought she was in colorado
MajesticEclipse02:	I think it's rain though
MajesticEclipse02:	I swear it looks like it's gonna snow outside
MajesticEclipse02:	Ah
SuperGummying:	But I tend to hate pretty much anyone
MajesticEclipse02:	True, some people here have made a good impression.
SuperGummying:	Depends if I like you, you can trust me
Deci:	but there's some really good people here
Deci:	Definitely don't trust me
SuperGummying:	Well majestic it depends who
Deci:	Well, I hope you can come to trust us, or at least some of us.
MajesticEclipse02:	Trustworthy I'm not to sure yet
Deci:	I'm probably a confusing mess. I"m like a bed of nails that's actually made of the most comfortable material ever
MajesticEclipse02:	Kingdom of Zeal is friendly
SuperGummying:	So yay go Eyan's community
SuperGummying:	Well the only person I trust so much, I met through this community
MajesticEclipse02:	Trust is a difficult thing to attain with people, especially if trust issues are a thing
Deci:	😦
MajesticEclipse02:	The one person I trusted died at the beginning of this month so now I just keep everything to myself
SuperGummying:	And it's not Dragonite
SuperGummying:	No I don't trust myself
Deci:	yourself?
SuperGummying:	I only really trust one person these days
Deci:	Patience?  I'm not impatient! - Ziggs
MajesticEclipse02:	Secrets ? I like secrets
Deci:	I'm bad with secrets
Deci:	Don't trust me
Aqua033:	Okay
KingofZeal:	/jksarcasm
KingofZeal:	Do tell Aqua, I love secrets
Aqua033:	Most people I don't trust at all but the ones I do trust I just give all my secrets to
Aqua033:	I'm really bad at trust issues
willofd2011:	Lol
MajesticEclipse02:	Boooooo liiiffeee
Dragonite:	brb liife
MajesticEclipse02:	My first console ever was a red small ds, it

Neon Strike Kitty:	The Sega DS

Dragonite:	DS
Neon Strike Kitty:	CT has an *amazing* soundtrack
MajesticEclipse02:	What do you play it on ?

Deci:	Looool
Dragonite:	schala is the princess of zeal
Deci:	Schala is a character, right? I've actually never played CT
Neon Strike Kitty:	I changed my nick to Schala to keep with the Chrono Trigger theme >.>
Deci:	Wait, ignore that, ida, I see that Schala is already a nickname
willofd2011:	*noms on a random cookie*
Kugallyblitz:	I guess the size and stuff is enjoyable
Deci:	Schala, would you like me to change your nickname to be changed to something closer to AceTrainerIda for clarification, or are you fine with Schala
Kugallyblitz:	that is true deci
MajesticEclipse02:	I love them lol, though know can't pick a favorite
Neon Strike Kitty:	Aqua should be named after the KH character
Deci:	they're pretty bland after like the first 2 bits IMO
Deci:	but I'm not too big a fan
Deci:	pringles are good
willofd2011:	Same lol

Kireina:	Oh I love whats her names song (not sure if its from awakening)
willofd2011:	For some reason every time I read the music it reminds me of fire emblem awakening lol
Kugallyblitz:	Im not one who creates songs myself, but I think the best songs come from one's emotions, so if you're bored, a song about the frustrations and feeling trapped about being bored?
Kireina:	maybe
Kireina:	Idk where im going with it so
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The ties that bind will always last
Withstanding time for love and friendships past
Kugallyblitz:	ok
Kireina:	This is what I have so far after like 30 minutes w/ revising
Kugallyblitz:	hmm, well either way thats cool
Kireina:	I also charge people to make some, but it's like I only open it up to my family and/or friends who play an instrument
Kireina:	Once I'm done I either just toss it or give it to my friend
willofd2011:	Sounds like it
Kugallyblitz:	yeah its a long and tough process
Kireina:	I don't know how music properly
Kireina:	just lyrics mainly
Kugallyblitz:	thats awesome

KingofZeal:	And anything to inflate my fragile enormous ego
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Deci:	I mean, the REAL Definition of a harem is: a group of female animals sharing a single mate.
Kireina:	or so everyone tells me
Rainy:	CAT BOYS
Kireina:	Because I currently have a lesbian haircut
KingofZeal:	It works for Cadence
KingofZeal:	Sure
Kireina:	Does it still count
Kireina:	What if I cross dress as a girl
Master9000:	From my point of view I'm the main character :(this is the moment at which I realize I didn't add an Anakin skywalker emote):
willofd2011:	*hides*
Kugallyblitz:	Thanks for the definition, Eyan.
KingofZeal:	Left that part out
KingofZeal:	Oh, excuse me
Rainy:	It's not the dick, it's the emotional connection and the dick
MajesticEclipse02:	well i shall just run away now
Kireina:	I mean
KingofZeal:	Thus, this is my harem
Kugallyblitz:	LOLOLOL
KingofZeal:	A harem is defined as, one guy having a ton of girls who want his dick, usually for no real reason other than he's the main character
MajesticEclipse02:	OH

Kireina:	Error 404 - Walkthrough is not complete
KingofZeal:	Me:  I'm expanding the harem
Lightning:  Even further?
Me:  There's no such thing as too big of a harem
Master9000:	You mean 114/114?
MajesticEclipse02:	heh

Dragonite:	he also thinks there's a direct correlation between the number of video tracks used and the quality of the product
SuperGummying:	i mean
KingofZeal:	I should rephrase, "to make one video"
SuperGummying:	or use sub bots
Master9000:	unless youre a well paid editor
Kugallyblitz:	cadance has made this earth a better place
KingofZeal:	Making good videos means nothing if you have to dedicate half your life to it, lol
cadance:	my job here is done
SuperGummying:	it will take a year to edit

KingofZeal:	Your question Majestic?
KingofZeal:	^
SuperGummying:	well interesting
cadance:	if eyan was a hearthstone card he'd be a 2 mana 4/5 with the ability "can't attack"
KingofZeal:	And I'm usually pretty quiet myself and let others do stuff around me
KingofZeal:	I like to watch other people
MajesticEclipse02:	Hey eyan I have a question
KingofZeal:	I'm the kind of person who can best be described as an "observer"
Dragonite:	(･ω･)
SuperGummying:	welp
KingofZeal:	And yes gummy, I've been reading chat, I had it up on my other monitor
cadance:	bill and ted would be proud dude
Master9000:	ok better and repeating words and cut wrists threw me off
MajesticEclipse02:	Numbers are easier if they're in the side
Kugallyblitz:	I suck at typing in general
KingofZeal:	Toss numbers into a test and my speed probably drops to half that, lol
Dragonite:	i literally type out my numbers instead of letters because it's faster than locating them on the number pad lol
cadance:	oh so THAT'S why you never use zhonya's
SuperGummying:	but i still look at the keyboard
cadance:	i learned it in elementary school OpieOP
KingofZeal:	I still suck at numbers though
SuperGummying:	i been better since grade 9
KingofZeal:	I've been a very fast typer for a long time though, I learned that skill correctly in middle school and cherished it
MajesticEclipse02:	Actually I might do something good on my pc maybe
Dragonite:	i remember doign twenty words per minute in elementary school and thinking it was an accomplishment
cadance:	over the course of a couple months i watched my wpm climb from 60 to 95
SuperGummying:	i didn't provoke dragonite
KingofZeal:	Probably could do 100 if I tried again
SuperGummying:	wait eyan's been watching the chat?
superheronerd:	We did nothing 😌
cadance:	i used to take a typing test every single day
willofd2011:	Lol XD
Kugallyblitz:	I just took the typing test thing, 45 WPM, 3 errors. Eh. I need to practice

willofd2011:	Nice lol ^w^
SuperGummying:	if i do than it's 22 words

Master9000:	i should really go sleep tbh
Dragonite:	yes
SuperGummying:	is everyone provoking gummy?
Dragonite:	somewhere in that range
Dragonite:	or twenty five
Dragonite:	a hundred characters per minute is like twenty words
Master9000:	rip
Master9000:	wait i thought that was 100 characters per minute
Dragonite:	it's one of those skills with zero real life applications though
superheronerd:	"Sometimes"
Dragonite:	typing a hundred words per minute comes in handy sometimes
Kugallyblitz:	omg dragonite that chat is beautiful XDDDDD
MajesticEclipse02:	Uh
Master9000:	dayum that synergy

Master9000:	people spent a lot of time with these bots lol
Master9000:	it bases it mroe on real words than symbol combinations
Master9000:	tatsu doesnt record it as anything either i think

Noex:	Right
KingofZeal:	Byebye
KingofZeal:	I'm done talking for real this time
KingofZeal:	Anyways
Master9000:	still looks really good and better than anything i could pull off for sure lmao
KingofZeal:	Honestly, the fact I can make it look like winter is crazy in itself
Noex:	And it's good to finally be done for the week
KingofZeal:	It's not perfect, cause there are some things that are simply too difficult to adjust
Dragonite:	heh
Master9000:	interesting how the water doesnt freeze there
Noex:	Anyone up to get their HOTS rewards for OW?
KingofZeal:	Banner isn't beveled
KingofZeal:	That's the banner
Master9000:	i dont see a bevel on that, who did you steal this from
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I already have a plan for the boxes
KingofZeal:	Also adjusted the winter stuff to have more realistic looking snow.  Pretty proud of how this came out.
Master9000:	you already have a plan for all the boxes or just mapping out how much stuff u can put down?
Master9000:	deep thinking designer?
KingofZeal:	I am an artistic genius, or something like that
Master9000:	oh nice
superheronerd:	I'm liking the buttons a lot so far o:
KingofZeal:	Yeah, and if you make it three columns, it will be just as spooky, lol
Master9000:	
KingofZeal:	?
Master9000:	i have been spooked
KingofZeal:	I was trying to fiddle with different size boxes to make it look good for both 2 and 3 columns
KingofZeal:	And realmaster, if you toggle nightmode on, you'll see that there's actually a method to that madness
Master9000:	it looks like youve been having a good week
KingofZeal:	On one hand, I'm not moving as fast as I'd like to, on the other hand, I'm happy I'm just being productive.  It's a big step for me considering how rough my depression has been
Master9000:	lol eyan still one step ahead even when crunched for time
Kugallyblitz:	stressful D:
KingofZeal:	So much to do, so little time
KingofZeal:	I'm more focused on finishing my twitch channel makeover, I'll come back and work on discord in a day or two when I finish that
Dragonite:	fun
KingofZeal:	Twitch isn't doing subscriptions right away anyways for affiliates, so it's a soontm sort of thing
superheronerd:	<@!162952008712716288> thank you though
Master9000:	theres also the elements which you still have plenty of time to think of something for
Dragonite:	brilliant
KingofZeal:	Neither option is available atm Dragonite
superheronerd:	Air of mystery is lost
KingofZeal:	I also have it for Pink Nu status but may or may not change my mind on that
Dragonite:	has the patreon thing been inplemented yet or do i actually have to learn to do the Twitch thing
Dragonite:	which does remind me
KingofZeal:	I gotta keep some things for pay to play people.  😛
Dragonite:	you're no fun either
Master9000:	<@137336478291329024> <#305486914910158848>
KingofZeal:	If ya'll can change your own names still, then I'm really lost as to how to disable that shit, lol
Dragonite:	well, that's no fun
Dragonite:	[M] BOTClyde: You do not have the Change Nickname permission on this server.
Dragonite:	Oh
SuperGummying:	Like username in settings
Dragonite:	Still works
SuperGummying:	I think you can change user name
Master9000:	right on queue
Dragonite:	unless they removed that
KingofZeal:	Make it happen <@!162952008712716288>
superheronerd:	Been meaning to ask someone
Dragonite:	just use ./nick <whatever> to change your name
superheronerd:	Sure
KingofZeal:	Also, Bella, do you want to be nicknamed to your twitch name or no?  I ask because I don't recognize you by your name and I'm dumb and forgetful.
Deino Mite:	That's why I stopped participating.
Deino Mite:	^
Dragonite:	control+H "Lillie", "Solgaleo"
KingofZeal:	That's a very dumb metric
SuperGummying:	Whoever has the most Lillie thumbnails at the end of their let's play gets Lillie
superheronerd:	_has so many questions _
Dragonite:	you still haven't started
Dragonite:	ash was finished a good month ago
Dragonite:	you're like a week behind in programming lillie bot
SuperGummying:	I named Lillie bot after her
Dragonite:	so gummy, on that note
SuperGummying:	She's a character in sun and moon
SuperGummying:	Actually Bella we are talking about Lillie
Dragonite:	id est, he doesn't even know what it's supposed to be
superheronerd:	_oh jeeeeeeeez_
Master9000:	its based on gummy's whatever you call it
Master9000:	lillie is a bot <@214587785510780929>
Dragonite:	heh
superheronerd:	Isn't it a bot
SuperGummying:	I actually know how to flirt
Dragonite:	that's where you were
Master9000:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768> here we go again folks
Dragonite:	you were having your underwear pulled up over your head
SuperGummying:	She likes me more
SuperGummying:	Lillie is mine Dragonite
SuperGummying:	Where was i
SuperGummying:	Bye Eyan
Master9000:	wow predicted my message
KingofZeal:	k, I got thing I want to accomplish so I'm leaving, RealMaster, I might do some channel reorganizing either tonight or tomorrow or maybe the day after, or whenever I feel like it really, just letting you know, kbai
Dragonite:	who? \*looks the other way\*
superheronerd:	Oh jeez
SuperGummying:	Dragonite started it *points at him*
Dragonite:	truuuuuuuuuue
KingofZeal:	Btw Dragonite, that's literally every stream, it's just a twitch chat
Master9000:	just ignore it eyan ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dragonite:	_gives Gummy an atomic wedgie_
KingofZeal:	v_v
Kugallyblitz:	sometimes not giving a damn gives you all the power
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you're the new old rival
SuperGummying:	Well okay fair enough
superheronerd:	That is a fair question actually
Dragonite:	hey eyan, you should do a stream where you just monkey around in chat for four hours
Master9000:	as you can see eyan, this rivaly transcends any and all planes of logic and common sense
SuperGummying:	Um maybe
KingofZeal:	Am I really a rival if I don't give a damn?
Dragonite:	_noms foot_
SuperGummying:	*kicks Dragonite*
Master9000:	<:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Dragonite:	_pokes Gummy with stick_
SuperGummying:	Not you master
Master9000:	i never asked you to fight for me gummy
SuperGummying:	Eyan is my new rival
Master9000:	damn eyan has a propane monopoly <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
SuperGummying:	I'm fighting for real
Dragonite:	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Dragonite:	rule 1 of the internet: don't irritate the people who have kicking powers
SuperGummying:	No way
KingofZeal:	All the girls, and grills, are mine.  😃
superheronerd:	Compromise found
Master9000:	uh oh
SuperGummying:	I'll fight you for her
Master9000:	i like that solution
KingofZeal:	This is the harem of Zeal afterall
SuperGummying:	No way Eyan
Kugallyblitz:	Sounds good
KingofZeal:	I can easily solve that if it's really and issue.  Aka, Lillie can just be mine.  😛
Dragonite:	we fought over way more stuff that that, matey
Master9000:	they fought over lillie
SuperGummying:	Dragonite and me are rivals
Master9000:	its kinda settled actually
SuperGummying:	I need money
KingofZeal:	The dragonite gummy feud makes no sense to me v_v
Dragonite:	but patreon . . .
Master9000:	i need to get moneys to spend moneys <:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
KingofZeal:	How bout you all just sub to me when twitch implements it and we all be one big happy family
Dragonite:	ಠ_ಠ
SuperGummying:	I'll pay you double Eyan
SuperGummying:	Say no pls
KingofZeal:	Don't tag my name and waste my time unless you're serious, lol
Dragonite:	it's 95% because i want it to troll Gummy and 5% because i think it would be a good idea
KingofZeal:	Oh
Master9000:	dragonite may pay you to add his custom bot to the server idk if hes FR tho
Dragonite:	that sounds like work, master
KingofZeal:	Who's paying me and why are they paying me?
Master9000:	code the bot to be able to take screenshots
Dragonite:	is it the "gummy sucks at pokémon" bot
Master9000:	i have an even better idea
Dragonite:	either that or i could manually inject it into his archive but where's the fun in that
Master9000:	dude
Dragonite:	unless i trick gummy to say the line about him being a girl again
SuperGummying:	He can't join
Dragonite:	but it's too late
SuperGummying:	Never
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> ^^^
Dragonite:	probably
Master9000:	are you saying you would pay eyan $10 to add ash?
Kugallyblitz:	ash bot is a troubled bot
Dragonite:	what i wouldn't give for ash bot to be part of this chat right about now
superheronerd:	Dragonite is such a chaotic neutral
Master9000:	why do you need to specify that gummy?
SuperGummying:	I'm not wearing a skirt.....I'm not a girl
Kugallyblitz:	D:<
Dragonite:	_pours lilac-colored paint all over Kugal_
Kugallyblitz:	It's awesome to be part of the orange club <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	i was gonna assume you would go with the 'no this is median' aproach
Dragonite:	_pulls up Gummy's skirt_
Master9000:	you already did that yourself lmao
Dragonite:	Yes
SuperGummying:	Master are trying to expose me?

Kireina:	Welcome back
MajesticEclipse02:	Okay I lied I'm back
Kireina:	so I threw it away
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've got an American copy of Chrono Trigger
Kireina:	after that point
Demon Lord 93:	I've finished it. it's a really great game
Kireina:	and the game ceased to continue to work
Neon Strike Kitty:	Robo = Rick Astley
Kireina:	But I also remember my game crashed
Aqua033:	Then I lost my cartridge
Kireina:	Well I remember Playing Chrono Trigger at some point
Aqua033:	I've played most of it
Demon Lord 93:	I feel like one of the only people here who's actually played CT

Kugallyblitz:	*still anticipates level up*
Master9000:	thats exactly what im changing
Aqua033:	Tatsumaki does.
Neon Strike Kitty:	but you're realy close to Kilwala
Aqua033:	Tatsumaki, though
Master9000:	no ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	mee6 doesn't let you know
Kireina:	*bwom bwom bwommm*
Neon Strike Kitty:	You don't need to anticipate
Kugallyblitz:	*anticipates level up*
Kireina:	Sick
Master9000:	ida and kugal are the two closest to a level up
Kireina:	O sht I made it to twelve
SuperGummying:	imma not level up
Kireina:	xD
Aqua033:	Too far from 12
Kireina:	I don't wanna lose all my progress :^)
Kireina:	I will sit out
Aqua033:	Uhh
Kireina:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	i think thats everyone
Master9000:	to test some mee6 changes for formatting?
Kugallyblitz:	howdy
Master9000:	someone want to level up
Master9000:	hey
Neon Strike Kitty:	but honestly liking a character just for their looks is shallow as hell
Kireina:	Just spam something once a minute <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Aqua033:	It is.
Aqua033:	I was a reletively smart 8 year old to be fair
Kugallyblitz:	I'm still awaiting that orange color coming :/
SuperGummying:	why me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, it kind of hits thresholds like that
Aqua033:	I like oranges
SuperGummying:	and you told me everything about her that was negative
Master9000:	lol everyone is orange now
Neon Strike Kitty:	How is an 8 year old supposed to play *any* Fire Emblem game?
SuperGummying:	hey ida i was her fan
superheronerd:	I still like awakening way more
Kireina:	had some weak ass stat gains
Kugallyblitz:	Holy moly I was gone for like 10 minutes 78+ new messages xD
Aqua033:	No, RD wasn't bad
It was just hard as hell, especially for my 8 year old self
Neon Strike Kitty:	Shadow Dragon was the really boring one with Marth
Neon Strike Kitty:	and you were caught out of the loop due to not having played PoR
Kireina:	wait it was called shadow dragon right? 🤔
Kireina:	All the characters
Neon Strike Kitty:	difficult
Neon Strike Kitty:	but a bit
Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	it wasn't
Neon Strike Kitty:	RD was fun
Kireina:	Least compared to Shadow Dragon
Aqua033:	I didn't pick up the series again until Fates
Kireina:	Wasn't that bad
Neon Strike Kitty:	I actually have a pretty thorough explanation of what I think of Camilla, but since it involves insulting her fans I should probably keep it to myself
Aqua033:	I had the misfortune of picking up RD as my first FE game
Dragonite:	but no dragonite
Dragonite:	seriously, garchomp, salamence, tyranitar and metagross all got a mega
Kireina:	or whatever it was called
SuperGummying:	*kicks dragonite*
Kireina:	Last Fire Emblem I played other then the new mobile one (for a brief stint) was The Burning Blade(?) I think
Dragonite:	dragonite needs a buff
Aqua033:	Who needs a buff?
Aqua033:	Uhh
Master9000:	~~starts a new conversation because cant relate~~
Aqua033:	Camilla wants the hell out of you and it's great
Neon Strike Kitty:	She's got 0 personality
Kireina:	I haven't played any of the newer Fire Emblems
SuperGummying:	is way better
SuperGummying:	her hair
SuperGummying:	nah dude
Kireina:	xd
Aqua033:	But, I put up with it because of the walking chest- I mean, Camilla
Neon Strike Kitty:	Wall of Kilwalas right here
superheronerd:	I still haven't played conquest
Kireina:	The rest of the time I lurk
Aqua033:	It kinda is tbh
SuperGummying:	camilla is best girl
Neon Strike Kitty:	*And Camilla is a terrible waifu*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Fates is boring*
SuperGummying:	^^^
Neon Strike Kitty:	I never finished my first run of birthright
Aqua033:	Camilla is the best girl
Kireina:	Plus I only really go to Eyan's Twitch for two things League and XCom xd
Aqua033:	I just lost interest over time
SuperGummying:	camilla!
superheronerd:	That reminds me I never finished my second run of birthright
Aqua033:	I've never *hated* it
SuperGummying:	i need to play conquest
Neon Strike Kitty:	just tolerate it because of Eyan's streams
Neon Strike Kitty:	Personally I've always kind of hated twitch
Aqua033:	I need to finish Conquest
Aqua033:	Pfft
Aqua033:	It's a bit more difficult to do that on Twitch
Neon Strike Kitty:	
Kireina:	^
Aqua033:	Because I can just close this for a minute, come back, and know exactly what happened
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	In Twitch I just spam for Eyan to take off his shirt
Neon Strike Kitty:	
Kireina:	so I don't bother anymore
Kireina:	But in Twitch it's kinda random
Aqua033:	It's easier to have actual conversation here
Kireina:	Usually in here we have actual conversations
Aqua033:	I need more anime gifs
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah
Kireina:	which I refer to as Twitch
Dragonite:	(･ω･)
Kireina:	I said in Eyan Chat
Neon Strike Kitty:	>second highest poster on the server
Neon Strike Kitty:	>lurk
Kireina:	Unless I know what the subject is about (which I don't most of the time cause super sheltered school child)
Aqua033:	And I get super rewarded for talking
Aqua033:	Water is really good
Kireina:	especially now that theres discord
Kireina:	That's all I ever do is lurk in Eyan Chat
Aqua033:	Later, Majestic
Kireina:	Cya Majestic
MajesticEclipse02:	And I'm lost, so I'll see you guys later, I have no class's tomorrow so see you in stream !!
Kireina:	lol
Aqua033:	Loose standards, mind you, but we have them
Aqua033:	We have standards
Neon Strike Kitty:	sounds like the good ol' Runeterran Brigade
Dragonite:	fun
Aqua033:	It's a place filled with degeneracy beyond what was previously thought impossible
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was wondering if it was the League one I used to use >.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah, so it's a RWBY one
Aqua033:	CardsAgainstRemnant
Dragonite:	_slaps ida's father_
Aqua033:	They're fun with the right people
Neon Strike Kitty:	Aqua, what's the rp server called?
willofd2011:	I've never done any role plays before lol
Aqua033:	Well then
Master9000:	checking if its worth it to switch to windows again
Neon Strike Kitty:	tbh I might just be calling him dad because he's been there for me more than my actual father
Aqua033:	In a bit
Master9000:	anyone want to play league?
Dragonite:	those were fun
Dragonite:	i've participated in role plays that go nowhere
Aqua033:	I have.
Aqua033:	Actually that's a lie
Aqua033:	Well, I technically have
Aqua033:	I'm on a large rp server yet I've never roleplayed
willofd2011:	Lol
Dragonite:	role playing is fun
Master9000:	lol
Aqua033:	I get it now
Aqua033:	OHH

Noex:	kingofGasms emote incoming
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> theres a ™ here
Dragonite:	no breathing allowed
KingofZeal:	<@137277936238592000> You won't be able to sub until that feature is put in.  Twitch said SoonTM.  I also just got home so I need to actually accept.  😛  I'll do that when I sit down later and can actually breath and think
willofd2011:	I'm just quiet in general lol
MajesticEclipse02:	Same, I never talk because, well, anti socialness
willofd2011:	Lol
Aqua033:	Well, I use the word "lurk" loosely
Aqua033:	At this point I just kinda lurk in Eyan's stream and that's it
Aqua033:	And a use tbh :^)
MajesticEclipse02:	Yaaayyy
Master9000:	lmao the reactions are like polls
willofd2011:	Awesome congrats Eyan ^w^
Aqua033:	I would if I had a job and/or money
BreeZaps:	I am gonna sub
BreeZaps:	Yay!
Aqua033:	Ayy! Great job, Eyan!

Aqua033:	This Thrall is dumb
willofd2011:	Nice lol

Aqua033:	Jesus, my HotS mmr is even worse than my League mmr
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Master9000:	Same Soon™
Necro:	Just finished work and chilling watching some outlast 2 gameplay
superheronerd:	Nearly there
superheronerd:	Going home!
Kugallyblitz:	so what are  you guys up to?
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's not even his ult, I just hate how much damage a frickin disruption tank deals!
Kireina:	Unlucky
Aqua033:	...My Warwick just body blocked me and got me killed by the Kog'Maw bomb
Kugallyblitz:	i like going home from almost anywhere
Kireina:	xd
Master9000:	<:Keepo:305611574327115777> me_irl
Master9000:	Not a support player nor even at a computer that can handle league rn but
Aqua033:	Any support players wanna queue with me?
Aqua033:	Gath never gives me issues
Master9000:	And yeah if he farmed ult stacks probably
Master9000:	Why is he alone then
Neon Strike Kitty:	If it's just the Cho there?
Master9000:	Getting bit by a delayed knockup lategame usually already means you're dead if you're backline
Neon Strike Kitty:	and then he still has his ult!
Neon Strike Kitty:	Not his ult, his Q
Neon Strike Kitty:	His Q deals half my health in damage even when he's built tank
Master9000:	Nah cho is cool
Neon Strike Kitty:	I loathe Cho'Gath
Master9000:	Nobody knows
Aqua033:	I really don't like Kog'Maw.
Aqua033:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	Even I'm better than that 😛
Aqua033:	Send help
I have a Xayah that can't last hit because they play only support
SuperGummying:	Unless you count minecraft
SuperGummying:	First time I held a bow
SuperGummying:	Yup but that was so cool
SuperGummying:	It was the only shot lol since we didn't have enough time for another
Neon Strike Kitty:	Still, there's more to archery than hitting the target.
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's a good first shot
Aqua033:	Subway is good
SuperGummying:	No Dragonite I didn't get hurt
SuperGummying:	I hit the red on the target with my first shot
SuperGummying:	Oh ida
Dragonite:	_flushes Gummy down the toilet_
SuperGummying:	No don't hide gummy
Animal_Glue_:	XD
Neon Strike Kitty:	Someone hide Gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh crap
SuperGummying:	Did I hear sponsorship?
Master9000:	What would that consist of? Lmao
Dragonite:	ヮﾟ)ノ
Dragonite:	ヽ( ｡
Dragonite:	how do i play this game
Neon Strike Kitty:	No
Necro:	We need to eyan a proper loot crate sponsorship
Neon Strike Kitty:	ew, lootcrate
Necro:	If you want loot got to loot crate.com/zeal and use promo code zeal for 10% off at the checkout
Neon Strike Kitty:	LOOTING
Necro:	Is it pillaging time yet?
Dragonite:	civ 5 doesn't have anything like baba yetu on the into video?
Dragonite:	aww
SuperGummying:	......
Dragonite:	you don't count
SuperGummying:	That doesn't count
SuperGummying:	I said I would never do the face
SuperGummying:	Oh no I just did it......
Dragonite:	_pokes Gummy's ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/\¯_
SuperGummying:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dragonite:	which face?
SuperGummying:	Now master got the face
Dragonite:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	And that reduces push down pressure
Master9000:	Wait but doesn't the scale not feel part of your weight because you're flying?
Dragonite:	_makes fun of Dragonite's weight_
SuperGummying:	115
SuperGummying:	Hey I weigh more than you
Dragonite:	_makes fun of Gummy's weight_
Master9000:	*irony intensifies*
SuperGummying:	110?
Dragonite:	you already know my weight
SuperGummying:	Dragonite you are a stick
SuperGummying:	Okay I thought so
Neon Strike Kitty:	Modern bows are kind of more advanced than classical bows, I think
Dragonite:	including your 3DS
Dragonite:	everything is made out of sticks
SuperGummying:	Modern bows aren't made out of sticks are they?
SuperGummying:	Oh sweet okay that won't hurt me
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I think there might be some sort of glove to protect your hand
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's some sort of equipment you can put on your forearm to shield it
Dragonite:	thank
SuperGummying:	But that's all
SuperGummying:	Well Dragonite
SuperGummying:	Okay good I don't wanna hit anyone
Neon Strike Kitty:	before you actually start shooting
Dragonite:	are you sure
SuperGummying:	And second Dragonite I'm not dumb enough to shoot myself
Neon Strike Kitty:	just to get accustomed to holding the bow
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd say take a few practice shots without an arrow
SuperGummying:	First of all I asked ida not Dragonite because she said she knows how to shoot one
Neon Strike Kitty:	Like, I actually think it's impossible.
Dragonite:	never doubt gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	then the instructor can correct your posture, grip, things like that
Neon Strike Kitty:	You know how much power you need to pull a bowstring? I don't think it's possible to shoot yourself in the face with a bow.
Dragonite:	that's up to him to figure out, isn't it?
Dragonite:	i don't know
Neon Strike Kitty:	Drago, how would that even happen?
Dragonite:	aim the bow at your face
Dragonite:	actually scratch that
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well, the bowstring might hurt your hand if you're not careful
Dragonite:	don't aim the bow at your face
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hmm
SuperGummying:	Any advice besides don't hurt myself?
SuperGummying:	Today I'm doing archery in gym class
SuperGummying:	Close enough
Neon Strike Kitty:	but I didn't select it as my name and I was just counting names
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh yeah
SuperGummying:	Also to reply to something early that you ida, you're also a provoker in one server
Dragonite:	no, because stupid gummy is entertaining gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was kidding
Neon Strike Kitty:	You do
SuperGummying:	Ida don't I need education?
SuperGummying:	Watching Lillie do the z move is too cute
Neon Strike Kitty:	Stop getting education!
Master9000:	I'm in school there's no computer good enough to boot league here
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.<
SuperGummying:	Hate time zones
SuperGummying:	Darn I'm at school
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think I have time for a quick 1v1
SuperGummying:	What no
Master9000:	You're not the senate gummy
Master9000:	Oh we're playing loser advances?
SuperGummying:	It's your turn
SuperGummying:	Now that I beat master *looks at ida*
Dragonite:	gummy loses just on the fact of being Gummy
SuperGummying:	Hey master we all agree I won
Master9000:	20% rip
SuperGummying:	Um
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's a pretty huge tax

Neon Strike Kitty:	Or 800
Neon Strike Kitty:	But seriously, give me one thousand credits. Plz, I need them.
Dragonite:	(･ω･)
Dragonite:	that sounds like a pretty good way to get booted from the server
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~also I need your 1k credits~~
SuperGummying:	Now time to get number 1 on the score board
SuperGummying:	Yeah it was pretty fun
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, did you spam your way to level 10 already?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wouldn't argue with that
Neon Strike Kitty:	It says in the online list that I'm playing God
Aqua033:	No, as in I have and I am directly altering people's fates
SuperGummying:	Master will you admit defeat today?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Nope, I am
Aqua033:	I'm actually playing God
Dragonite:	(◕ ε ◕);
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals Aqua's name, identity and past*
Aqua033:	Jokes on you, I don't have a heart
Dragonite:	_destroys the evidence_
Neon Strike Kitty:	*gets charged with murder*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals Aqua's heart*
Dragonite:	_feeds the shoes to his dog_
Aqua033:	*Steals the insurance money before you can buy new shoes*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*uses the insurance money to buy new shoes*
Dragonite:	_slaps Tatsu_
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Dragonite leveled up!**
Dragonite:	_steals Ida's shoes_
Aqua033:	I'm the person who's playing with the girl
Aqua033:	Someone else did
Aqua033:	I didn't screw up his crush
Aqua033:	No
Deino Mite:	So you screwed up someone's crush, and he isn't he one who hates you, it's someone else?
Necro:	Wow
Aqua033:	Someone actually hates me more than the person who screwed up their crush, all because I'm playing with her.
Deino Mite:	Has*
Deino Mite:	Oh no! Even Aqua had Kilwala. In really behind everyone.
Aqua033:	Welp
Necro:	So anyone doin anything interesting
Necro:	Have fun with that
Necro:	Okay
Neon Strike Kitty:	I stole them all
Necro:	I have about 5 pairs of these shoes
Neon Strike Kitty:	Well that's good eating
Necro:	Cool they wear only £5
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals your shoes*
Necro:	Don't wear any
Neon Strike Kitty:	*all of them*
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals your socks*
Necro:	Same all my money is in 3 different bank accounts
Neon Strike Kitty:	*gives you Necro's wallet*
Aqua033:	Joke's on you I don't have one
Neon Strike Kitty:	*steals your wallets*
Necro:	Yeah I'm a fucked up person
Necro:	Part of a princess guard
Necro:	Hound of tindalos 'scavenger of time'
Aqua033:	I get around.
Aqua033:	I'm the server's water child in two servers, the aforementioned child of the two most popular people in one, a god damn edgelord in one, bronze in one, and now I'm God.
Necro:	Meme in another
Necro:	I'm a arse bandit in one,  slave to a prison warden in another,  hit movie director in another
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's also one where I'm a thief, one where I'm a knight and... I think that's it
Aqua033:	Hmm
Neon Strike Kitty:	*Three
Neon Strike Kitty:	I knew I was missing something
Neon Strike Kitty:	Wait, I'm a goddess in two servers
Neon Strike Kitty:	but mostly I'm a cat or a bad pun
Neon Strike Kitty:	a prince in one (?)
Neon Strike Kitty:	A general in one
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm a lion in two more
Aqua033:	I'd recommend not questioning my personal activities. You'd be questioning for a while.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm a princess in.... apparently two servers
Necro:	Seems legit
Neon Strike Kitty:	...alright, have fun with that
Aqua033:	...So, I'm the child of two the most popular people on the server in one server, and God in another
Neon Strike Kitty:	OBJECTION! Go away!
Necro:	You are not worthy to be in the presence of the lord never mind speaking out of turn
Aqua033:	Oh
Neon Strike Kitty:	(I've been quoting Edgeworth for the last few minutes)
Neon Strike Kitty:	Your Honor, I'm sorry but... I cannot allow you to not allow me to make an objection!
Aqua033:	A worthy sacrifice.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I believe the correct term here is "You fail!"
Necro:	I shall slash my wrist in penance of this horrid offence to thy lord
Aqua033:	Forgiven.
Aqua033:	Ah.
Necro:	Sorry auto correct happened
Aqua033:	Don't you mean, malevolence?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo!
Necro:	May thy lord edge rule over us with great benevolence
Aqua033:	/s
Aqua033:	I'm the only one worthy of existing
Necro:	No because the edge is the only true being in this world
Aqua033:	Not really.
Neon Strike Kitty:	But it's a valid objection
Necro:	Objection denied
Neon Strike Kitty:	objectionable
Neon Strike Kitty:	That was....
Neon Strike Kitty:	OBJECTION!
Aqua033:	
Necro:	Then let us all edge together
Neon Strike Kitty:	OW
Aqua033:	Don't worry, I'm always edgy
Necro:	Sorry in a dark mood today
Aqua033:	Having to wake up at 6:30 and it being 15 minutes before your bus comes sucks
Necro:	So does anyone want to join me on a walk through the streets drowned by decay and misery
Master9000:	Damn the overnight download is fucked up
Neon Strike Kitty:	Morning
Necro:	Doesn't everyone just love walking through a garden full of corpses

Master9000:	Ok I'm gonna go sleep for real now
Aqua033:	Alright. Thanks!
Master9000:	Yeah some people just get along better than others
Master9000:	So just ask them if they're feeling ok occasionally to make sure nothing's wrong and that they know that people care, introverts often have less people to talk to than they would like.
Aqua033:	I don't know what they like about me, but I'm doing *something* right, I guess
Aqua033:	Hell, even the person they're closest with had to wait a bit to get where I am
Kireina:	look at us cool orange people
Master9000:	Oh cool
Aqua033:	But usually really closed towards people
Kireina:	LOL

SuperGummying:	oh you know what
Master9000:	Gummy I'm not dignifying that question with a response that was for aqua lmao
Aqua033:	Hey Lucky
Aqua033:	A person I've been actively talking to for...two weeks now? Told me they're willing to talk with me about just about anything.
LuckyTumminello:	also hello everybody in discord
SuperGummying:	so i'll get the person to scare you to sleep
Master9000:	Whys that?
Aqua033:	I'm feeling super awkward right now
SuperGummying:	um who are you scared of in the chat?
Master9000:	How so

Neon Strike Kitty:	Master, what are you doing?

Aqua033:	Summoner name is AquaSeafaring
SuperGummying:	give it to someone else
SuperGummying:	jk
SuperGummying:	me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Same name?
Aqua033:	Sure.
Neon Strike Kitty:	But putting that aside, should I add you?
Aqua033:	Oh
Neon Strike Kitty:	*just realized you need to have been friends for 24 hours before gifting*
Aqua033:	I want Rakan!
Aqua033:	Hmm
Neon Strike Kitty:	This is an extremely temporary offer since I'm going to sleep soon
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, I've managed to save up 6300 IP, but already have both champs.... anyone want a gift?
Neon Strike Kitty:	and yet somehow I keep rolling bot
Aqua033:	Ah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've had 3 Sivir games in a row due to Xayah getting banned
Aqua033:	I got first pick
Neon Strike Kitty:	*has not been able to roll Xayah*
Aqua033:	That being said, that game did reignite my love for Xayah
Aqua033:	Fiora is 2/6
Quinn is 0/8
Ryze is 2/6
and I'm 6/6
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~you're just jelly cause you didn't have a 27/0 Lux on your team~~
Aqua033:	This team is...terrible.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Even if it did get me killed. My team was near and managed to clean up.
Neon Strike Kitty:	But it worked
Master9000:	no the safet thing to do for an adc
Neon Strike Kitty:	>.>
Neon Strike Kitty:	it started turning around when I jumped into Baron pit, killed their jungler and stole the dragon
Neon Strike Kitty:	I got an A rank on Sivir despite doing terribly early on
Aqua033:	My team confuses the hell out of me.
Aqua033:	...And due to my own stupidity I'm even.
Aqua033:	No, I got FB
Master9000:	he gets 24% of first bloods
Master9000:	well yeah
Aqua033:	...They're losing to a Talon
Kireina:	whilst forcing him to push wave
Kireina:	and at the very least it'll do pebble dmg
Kireina:	All he has to do is just stand next to minions anyways
Kireina:	^
Deci:	and that's his fault
Deci:	that's getting poked
Master9000:	zed w cooldown
Deci:	But then that's not a trade/duel
Master9000:	just no
Master9000:	but
Aqua033:	Their excuse was "He far outranges Fiora"
Aqua033:	Yeah
Deci:	especially after lvl 3, and even after lvl 6
Deci:	Fiora can easily win trades against zed
Kireina:	or you know just abuse the fact that you should win pre 6 anyways
Aqua033:	Yeah
Master9000:	q out of his damn shurikens then
Kireina:	lol
Aqua033:	Me, attempting to offer tips: Be aggressive. You can win a trade with any champion as Fiora.
The person I'm offering tips to: Doesn't work against Zed
What.
Aqua033:	I may want to queue up later
SuperGummying:	no i don't see anything but a face
Master9000:	just because you signed something doesnt mean it controls any of us ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aqua033:	see? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aqua033:	That's just a discord emote though
SuperGummying:	yeah he does i sign a contract

Kireina:	I thought you were what happened xd
Aqua033:	I'm doing solo queue
Kireina:	oh
Aqua033:	No
Kireina:	Well you are playing with a group?

Aqua033:	This Shen's mechanics and awareness are amazing, and he's bronze 1.
Aqua033:	I think I'm playing against a smurf
Aqua033:	They actually knew what to do when I invaded

Kireina:	niiice
Deci:	I still won that game.
Kireina:	LOL
Deci:	11 minutes in was lvl 3
Deci:	I literally just had a raka go 0/5 in the first 10 minutes because she was "full roam support"
Kireina:	so I hope you didn't die
Kireina:	I mean you were messaging me for awhile
Aqua033:	This game is tilting

Kugallyblitz:	hello pandapenguin
Kireina:	Hey hi and hello friendo
Master9000:	holy shit
MajesticEclipse02:	Helloo and good afternoon lovely pancakes
Master9000:	nowhere near full anything
Master9000:	yeah that chart was just one example of a defenition of apathy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't try to explain everything with a fucking chart
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes
SuperGummying:	Psychology is a really complicated thing?
Dragonite:	that's the one you're looking for
Dragonite:	(╯°Д°）╯︵ /(.□ . \\)
Dragonite:	nonono ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	What did I just tell you?
Neon Strike Kitty:	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
SuperGummying:	There's no loss on the chart though
Master9000:	probably loss
SuperGummying:	But I'm glad I'm better these days
SuperGummying:	Not sure what kind though
SuperGummying:	I been through depression before
Master9000:	spooky super secret
Master9000:	a lot more than just color reaction time and foot in the door effect
Neon Strike Kitty:	Psychology is a really complicated thing
Master9000:	mental illness is an umbrella term for several different kinds, some of which likely overlap with the 4th stage of grief in situations of trauma
Kugallyblitz:	yep
Master9000:	another form is the 4th stage of grief
Kugallyblitz:	but 2 right there for example
Kugallyblitz:	not only 2
Kugallyblitz:	there is the mood of being depressed and the mental illness there's 2
Aqua033:	Can confirm, depression takes many forms.
Master9000:	eyan probably doesnt want to share specifics but thats not the same thing that is going on u know who <@199725993416589313>
Neon Strike Kitty:	Nothing in life is that simple.
Neon Strike Kitty:	*sighs*
Neon Strike Kitty:	Right.
Neon Strike Kitty:	You thought depression had one form?
Master9000:	its like mental disorders, theres a spectrum
SuperGummying:	I thought depression had one form
SuperGummying:	I never knew that
SuperGummying:	Interesting
Kugallyblitz:	yeah it can be
Master9000:	theres also this kind of apathy and theyre related but a bit different defenition
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think it's a form of depression
Neon Strike Kitty:	Apathy towards life is a thing
Kugallyblitz:	like someone is apathetic towards school if they say "They don't teach us anything we'd use in the real world."
Kugallyblitz:	for something
Kugallyblitz:	Apathy is the feeling of something being useless, or having no ounce of importance
SuperGummying:	Apathy?
Kugallyblitz:	D:
Neon Strike Kitty:	My apathy's gone so far that I've stopped taking care of myself >.>
Master9000:	I don't apply myself I apply the tech to stuff
Kugallyblitz:	I'm very good at math, which I thought to be a useless subject, but I was good at it for no reason so I applied myself and now I love it. If you are good at a subject applying yourself can go a long way.
Master9000:	since theres nothign to look forward to after this
Master9000:	oh i know everything is completely and entirely pointless with no chance of making any impact on the universe but im still gonna make the most of the time i do have here
Kugallyblitz:	It's very hard to learn when your apathy meter is high as well
Aqua033:	60% is passing here
SuperGummying:	Probably kicked
Master9000:	and youre gonna get either taught well or kicked out hard
SuperGummying:	Imma go to your school
Kugallyblitz:	college is strict with that stuff
SuperGummying:	Well guess I'll make them
Master9000:	I don't think my school records anything below a 55 lol
SuperGummying:	But they let her pass with some assignments
SuperGummying:	Someone got a 47%
Master9000:	I think 85 is mastery for getting college credit for a tech class
SuperGummying:	For me my school is nice
Deci:	Passing where I am is 70%, anything lower and my high school and college will make you retake
Kugallyblitz:	I remamber at one school they did it with completely different grading, if you got an O+ that was considered perfect
SuperGummying:	I'll probably have a K
Kugallyblitz:	at my school anyways
Kugallyblitz:	A is outstanding, B is Above average, C is average, D is below average, F is Fail
Master9000:	It's actually somewhere in the 60s here too
Kugallyblitz:	a passing grade here is anything 60% and above
SuperGummying:	For me my parents want me to just pass so I make it the bare minimum
Master9000:	A passing grade for my parents is a 92
SuperGummying:	A passing grade here is 50%
Master9000:	Wait that's your math course derp
SuperGummying:	75%
Master9000:	Gummy you Are barely passing too sit down
Kugallyblitz:	well, Ida and Deci I hope your difficulties lessen in the near future
SuperGummying:	Master I'll help
Master9000:	I Think the part that they are actually struggling on his understanding that pH is actually 10^-x H+ ions
Deci:	Mines pretty infrequent, but incredibly severe. I leaned how to measure breaths from a young age cuz I didn't know it was asthma
Master9000:	Yeah pretty much deci
Kugallyblitz:	I couldn't do PE activities when I was in elementary school because of it and its terrible
Neon Strike Kitty:	I got an asthma attack once. It was weird, I've never had any other cases of it and I don't know what triggered it.

Deci:	Acid and bases aren't hard to distinguish
Kugallyblitz:	school, a bunch of work
Kugallyblitz:	anyways
Kugallyblitz:	*cringe*
Kugallyblitz:	and it was amazing at how most of the students go to blame humans for "stealing" their honey
Kugallyblitz:	I had a class about colony collapse disorder on bees a few weeks ago
Kugallyblitz:	huh, thats interesting
Master9000:	Acid base stuff feels like everyone else is seeing tons if issues with it
Master9000:	Helping gf with homework
Kugallyblitz:	Doing very well myself
Aqua033:	Good.
Kugallyblitz:	how is everyone doing in the kingdom of zeal
SuperGummying:	I rather call him the dude that has trouble breathing
SuperGummying:	Thing
SuperGummying:	Dark and darth same
Deino Mite:	yes
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> does calling him "dark Vader" instead of Darth Vader constitute treason?
Master9000:	On weight
SuperGummying:	No
Neon Strike Kitty:	On the psychopass?
Master9000:	Is gummy still 115?
Neon Strike Kitty:	?
Master9000:	<@!141255588846895105> <@199725993416589313>  118.6/53.8
SuperGummying:	I'm going to start running from both chats
Neon Strike Kitty:	You made me angry in this one and it extends to both
SuperGummying:	Okay did I make you angry in both chats ida?
Aqua033:	That is actually a big spoiler for people who haven't seen S3 yet
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not talking to you anymore
Neon Strike Kitty:	And you.....
Neon Strike Kitty:	After three seasons of character development?
Neon Strike Kitty:	but you know that the character who died was one of the main characters?
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's not the ending
SuperGummying:	You know the ending though
Neon Strike Kitty:	Fucking spoilers
Neon Strike Kitty:	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy
Neon Strike Kitty:	Mate
Aqua033:	Now I know what you're talking about
SuperGummying:	Dragonite freedom was not a bad choice
Aqua033:	I was thinking witch girl because Glynda Goodwitch
Dragonite:	i mean, gummy needs to reconsider a lot of his life choices, but not necessarily for those reasons
SuperGummying:	My life choices was joining freedom
Aqua033:	Oh
SuperGummying:	Meh why not
Deino Mite:	go reconsider all your life choices
SuperGummying:	Yes I was cheering for the bad guy
SuperGummying:	Nope I thought it was cool
Master9000:	Not the slightest clue
Deino Mite:	you have no idea how sad that part is
SuperGummying:	Cool
Deino Mite:	<:FailFish:305611995787296768>
SuperGummying:	She evaporated
SuperGummying:	I only watch that
SuperGummying:	Yeah final battle
Deino Mite:	its during the last episode of season 3
Deino Mite:	its not during the first episode
Aqua033:	That ain't the final battle
Aqua033:	During the first episode?
Master9000:	I have a feeling that that is a spoiler but idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
SuperGummying:	But it was pretty cool that red head got evaporated during the final battle against the witch girl
SuperGummying:	I dislike rwby
Neon Strike Kitty:	idk
Master9000:	Don't you need to add the person or share a server for Dms to work tho
Neon Strike Kitty:	But DMs still work
Master9000:	@Pyrrhabot#7914 isn't even on the server?
Neon Strike Kitty:	(and don't ask why she has a Soraka icon, I couldn't fix that)
Neon Strike Kitty:	(she doesn't respond)
Neon Strike Kitty:	Aqua, try sending a message to Pyrrhabot#7914
Aqua033:	I may explain why all my friends were made through RWBY another day.
Master9000:	I thought it was some pokemon thing and then immediately realized I was wrong and left
Neon Strike Kitty:	*and yet no one's listening with me*
Deino Mite:	i love RWBY ❤
Master9000:	*happily doesn't relate*
Aqua033:	~~Totally doesn't have bias because all my frineds were made through RWBY~~
Aqua033:	RWBY's great
Dragonite:	maybe
Neon Strike Kitty:	Does that make me a weeb?
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, I've got RWBY music playing from Ayana right now
Dragonite:	(っ◕‿◕)っ weebs
Aqua033:	Well, you're a part of us :^)
Neon Strike Kitty:	what a bunch of weebs
Aqua033:	Weeb stuff
Dragonite:	｡･ﾟ･◝( ◕ ヮ ◕)◜･ﾟ･｡
Dragonite:	i have no idea what any of y'all are talking about
Neon Strike Kitty:	what a surprise
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oh wow, conversation
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Awua033 leveled up!**
Aqua033:	Alright
Master9000:	Go help <@212257792722075650>
Aqua033:	I already have the rewards, I'm just offering help to those who want it
Deino Mite:	Ah
Aqua033:	It gets people rewards in Overwatch, so that's why people are doing it
Deino Mite:	I don't play HotS
Deino Mite:	Oh
Master9000:	More ?
Aqua033:	The HotS thing
Deino Mite:	What's the nexus challenge?
Aqua033:	I'm gonna be home in a few minutes, does anyone want help on the Nexus Challenge?
Deino Mite:	I go to an advanced math and science school and my math and science classes are some of the easiest classes for me.
Master9000:	I'm surviving algebra 2 rn fairly well compared to geometry
Aqua033:	Every year before last I never learned anything, to the point where they moved me up a year despite my many special ed requirements, because I was getting nothing out of math before it
Aqua033:	I've never had issues with math until this year, tbh
Deino Mite:	Computer science is what I want to pursue so I'm happy that math and compsci are related.
Lightning:	Considering my love of science my downfall in math was kinda depressing, like why did they have to be connected!?
Aqua033:	Our teacher this year spends...about 10 minutes on a lesson, gives us the formula, and gives us the rest of class to do the homework.
Deino Mite:	Next year I have Adv. PreCalc and spatial Geometry.
Deino Mite:	I'm taking Adv. Algebra and Trig this year and Adv. Geometry.
Aqua033:	I had a pretty good teacher last year
willofd2011:	Lol
Lightning:	but the sequal sucked
Lightning:	Algebra I and I were pals
Deino Mite:	I'm pretty good at almost anything academic.
Aqua033:	I get algebra just fine, it's geometry that screws me over
Lightning:	Trig was the final nail in the coffin along with Algebra II
Lightning:	or at least the start of it
Lightning:	Oh I know that feeling, Geometry was my downfall when it came to mathmatical acedemic pursuits.
Aqua033:	I can't understand geometry for crap, so I can't afford to sleep during it
Lightning:	Not much, it's a beautiful day in the city of Pittsburgh, not a cloud in the sky!
Deino Mite:	I sleep in almost everything except history but it's mostly math because I already know most of it.
willofd2011:	What's up lol ^w^
Aqua033:	Qdoba is good.
Aqua033:	Hello!
Lightning:	What's up party people!
willofd2011:	Good afternoon everyone ^w^
Aqua033:	Half of 5th is just us screwing around on our phones anyways, and 6th is just information that I already know
Aqua033:	The classes I sleep in the most are 5th and 6th
Deino Mite:	Btw, last period just ended.
Deino Mite:	I sleep in my classes pretty often.
Kireina:	y'all need jesus
Kireina:	lol
Aqua033:	I mean, to be fair, it kinda usually does.
Master9000:	Just sleep in your classes it will end well <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Aqua033:	I want to sleep but I'm not tired enough to
Master9000:	More stuffs
Dragonite:	programmed RPG quests today. was fun.
Necro:	Cool
Master9000:	6 mins before class ends
Master9000:	Just did lab
Necro:	So how is everyones day so far
Deino Mite:	I have to go. Class is gettin over.
Deino Mite:	Guess I'll just need to talk to people more.
Deino Mite:	Dang. I'm pretty far off then.
Neon Strike Kitty:	10
Deino Mite:	What level do you unlock Kilwala at?
Aqua033:	Pretty much
Deino Mite:	So never <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Aqua033:	She likes us when we're not being completely horrible
Deino Mite:	Xp*
Deino Mite:	In only 100 xo away from the next class thing I think.
Aqua033:	Eh, could be worse
Deino Mite:	RIP
Aqua033:	She hates our class though ngl
Aqua033:	She is
Deino Mite:	Your Chinese teacher must be pretty cool then.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm so cross-eyed I can't even see how cross-eyed I am!
Aqua033:	Fun fact, my Chinese teacher was nominated for the best teacher in the state
Deino Mite:	Cross eyed would be >.<
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm cross-eyed!
Neon Strike Kitty:	<.>
Aqua033:	Last year I only did 3 laps on the mile but I got away with it because our teachers are dumb
Deino Mite:	Figured I'd come see if anyone was on discord.
Deino Mite:	My teacher in PE is super oblivious so I can pretty much do anything.
Aqua033:	...My Chinese class was just talking about how we would always do that during the mile
Deino Mite:	I finally found something to do during PE: hide in a corner and see if anyone's on discord.

Master9000:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, not bothering reading everything
Noex:	Keep forgetting they added an OW map to HoTS now
Kugallyblitz:	I'm gonna get off for tonight everyone, so good day or night :]
Kugallyblitz:	better than just plain links too
Kugallyblitz:	a much needed update
Demon Lord 93:	nicely done!
Kugallyblitz:	those look WAAY better than the old ones
KingofZeal:	Good
Kugallyblitz:	well done eyan, basic, but again more official looking, visually appealing
Kugallyblitz:	oh wow those look awesome
Kugallyblitz:	let's have a looksie
KingofZeal:	Spring social media icons up.  Feedback welcomed.  Also made the banner at the top spring variented
Kugallyblitz:	wow
Kireina:	<:KappaPride:305603580017246209>
Kireina:	its the afternoon for him
Noex:	KappaPride
Kugallyblitz:	night xeon
Demon Lord 93:	have a good one
Noex:	Next week again for round 2 of rewrds
Noex:	See ya
Kugallyblitz:	I actually have 2 gameboys, from 1989, only planned on having one, but at my local game store they were selling one for $10 so i had to get it, plus it was a different color and I could trade pokemon... boy I was invested in OLD games LOL
Demon Lord 93:	oh yeah I've heard of those
Noex:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	man those are cool
Noex:	Yeah, I'll be back end of June
Kugallyblitz:	i have every gameboy except for the gameboy light, exclusive to japan and like $100 on amazon
Demon Lord 93:	indeed XD
Noex:	Yeah, it's the afternoon
Kugallyblitz:	haha
Kugallyblitz:	blockbuster man thats old
Kugallyblitz:	after my GBA broke never played it.. sad, but when I was 12 I wanted to replace it and started to replay SMW more. eventually collected every gameboy in existence
Demon Lord 93:	I actually used to rent snes games from blockbuster...yes that was a thing when I was young lol
Demon Lord 93:	yeah I had the super nintendo growing up so my first was one of those games
Kugallyblitz:	i think my first game was super mario world on the GBA
Demon Lord 93:	right
Kugallyblitz:	instead of just playing them for the sake of turning the game on and hitting buttons
Kugallyblitz:	started learning to take games a little more serious at like 10
Kugallyblitz:	I started playing when I was 4
Kugallyblitz:	same man
Demon Lord 93:	oh yeah I've been playing since I was like 4
Kugallyblitz:	so yeah I could see why thats way strange to ya
Kugallyblitz:	i've been playing young too, was introduced to the whole mouse keyboard thing when I was 10, so when deciding which to use it just comes down to the game and subject material and objectives, which is more maneuverable or easier to do.
Demon Lord 93:	indeed
Kugallyblitz:	just go with what you know
Kugallyblitz:	that would make sense
Demon Lord 93:	I'm 23 now
Demon Lord 93:	I started playing games very young so that too
Kugallyblitz:	but thats just me
Kugallyblitz:	with shooters it's communication between hands, and it's a little bit harder when they're farther away controlling two input devices. but one controller with minimum buttons is better gaming experience
Kugallyblitz:	even simple games that require just one button to function
Kugallyblitz:	oh yeah
Demon Lord 93:	like shooters
Kugallyblitz:	there are some games that were intended for mouse and keyboard but can be better with a controller
Demon Lord 93:	yea
Kugallyblitz:	just way tinier
Kugallyblitz:	the screen too
Demon Lord 93:	yeah I'm so used to regular controllers at this point in my life
Kugallyblitz:	just the atmosphere and method is completely different
Kugallyblitz:	pc is really weird adjusting to
Demon Lord 93:	although I did play simcity once a long time ago
Kugallyblitz:	console for playing with friends is when I usually play that
Demon Lord 93:	was never for me
Demon Lord 93:	yeah I don't see myself ever getting into PC
Kugallyblitz:	pc for convenience mainly
Demon Lord 93:	oh hey
Kugallyblitz:	I play console and pc
Kugallyblitz:	hello im back
Kireina:	<@!128388878947057664> !!!
Demon Lord 93:	I've always been a console gamer
Demon Lord 93:	I'm probably one of the only ones here who doesn't play PC games
Noex:	Just doing the HoTS rewards for OW
Kugallyblitz:	thats cool
Demon Lord 93:	well I'm off work for the summer so just chillin for now
Kugallyblitz:	what are you guys up to
Noex:	I really need to get a new one >~>
Noex:	Riperino micerino
Kugallyblitz:	unrip music
Kireina:	which will then enter the room
Kireina:	well you use a command to activate the bot
Kugallyblitz:	rip music
Pogi:	When there is a music channel but no music bot
Kugallyblitz:	this is true
Kireina:	idk, but eyan needs to make more voice channels or somethin lol
Kugallyblitz:	whats temp voice chat for? temporarily chatting with voices? lel
SuperGummying:	Okay there's going to be issues with that project though
willofd2011:	The temp voice chat tho lol
Kugallyblitz:	huh, sounds cool
Kugallyblitz:	oh, will and gummy, I finally accepted your friend requests on twitch btw
superheronerd:	It's a really nice one. Nintendo. If it's the one I think it is, you develop a town as it's mayor. I love playing it
Kugallyblitz:	whats that game?
SuperGummying:	Animal crossing 365 days
Kugallyblitz:	thats crazy man
Kugallyblitz:	crazy idea is crazy?
SuperGummying:	I didn't even film since I got a crazy idea
Kugallyblitz:	editing a video slowly turned into dinner... yeah
Kugallyblitz:	fun stream tonight, even though I missed quite a bit from editing a video
Pogi:	I still like my theory of him being on the misguided "Skype master race"
Kugallyblitz:	I missed like 85% of it
Kugallyblitz:	lol, yeah i didnt see ya
SuperGummying:	I missed the stream 😭
Kugallyblitz:	Eyan's been wanting to do them for a while, and then one day he devoted a week to doing it, just the difficulty of not getting around to it is all.
Pogi:	Someone tell me how you convince this man that Discord was a good idea after A YEAR of using Skype while Discord was a thing.

SuperGummying:	Drink milk
Kugallyblitz:	you can either wait it out

SuperGummying:	I like that ida
Kugallyblitz:	what happened gum gum balloon?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I say it Gumenbaüer
SuperGummying:	What happened after the call btw?
Dragonite:	how about "gum gum balloon"
SuperGummying:	You never believed what happened
Kugallyblitz:	I'll settle with "gummy"
Kugallyblitz:	was thinking of a way to say your name
Kugallyblitz:	Howdu gummy
SuperGummying:	Sup blitz
Kugallyblitz:	howdy fellas
SuperGummying:	Depends on how long homework takes
SuperGummying:	K later

Neon Strike Kitty:	Uhh, turret/100 cs/first blood
Aqua033:	Fiora
Losing to a Garen
willofd2011:	Lol
Aqua033:	She was losing to a Garen
Aqua033:	lmao this Fiora was complaining about Garen being no skill
SuperGummying:	Turret or nexus or first blood?
SuperGummying:	Depends
SuperGummying:	Maybe
Neon Strike Kitty:	Gummy, how about that 1v1 later, maybe?
Aqua033:	It doesn't much help that I'm duoing with a gold/plat, so they actually know what to do, and I can't control super hard
Master9000:	7 my time
SuperGummying:	10 your time
SuperGummying:	No
Master9000:	For me the night starts at 5:30 ok let's go
SuperGummying:	9 your time

SuperGummying:	Deal?
Master9000:	Don't worry you won't
SuperGummying:	Tonight
SuperGummying:	No I'm going now
SuperGummying:	I don't wanna let master lose
Master9000:	Let's go
Master9000:	Neither am I that's why it's fair
SuperGummying:	I don't wanna let anyone see as well
SuperGummying:	No thanks I'm not ready
Master9000:	Yeah sure I'll have overwolf replay gummys death for ya
Master9000:	Let's do his
Neon Strike Kitty:	so maybe save a replay and upload

Neon Strike Kitty:	I kind of want to see this
SuperGummying:	Yeah me
SuperGummying:	I said kappa
Master9000:	Because we both know I'm gonna get the first blood <:KappaPride:305603580017246209>
Master9000:	Howling abyss first turret
Master9000:	Let's go
SuperGummying:	Hey master 1v1? Me shyv you Darius? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	I don't^
SuperGummying:	I know how to play shyv but master doesn't believe me
Neon Strike Kitty:	Shyv's a lot of fun
Master9000:	That's why it's called the Eyan's shyvana strategy
Aqua033:	Okay, doing this on Kha is a bad idea.
Neon Strike Kitty:	and falling behind as a result even though I know I shouldn't do that
Neon Strike Kitty:	I try that on Shyvana but end up ganking a lot
Master9000:	You mean the Eyan shyvana technique?
Aqua033:	I'm not gonna be ganking much, just putting their jungler super behind
Aqua033:	Basically, I'm practicing my jungle control
SuperGummying:	Yes Ida it's a shoulder that hurts
Master9000:	?
Aqua033:	I'm testing out how good controlling the jungle is
Aqua033:	But that's for aggression
Aqua033:	I mean, he is a ticket out of bronze
Deino Mite:	yi is better but you should play what you are better on
Master9000:	Yi is the jungle ticket out of bronze
Aqua033:	Send help this person's pressuring me to play Yi because Warwick was banned even though Kha is better
Deino Mite:	pretty sure riot confirmed nidalee as vastaya
Master9000:	Define vastaya because those seem like a bunch of different species
Aqua033:	I don't know
Deino Mite:	good job ida
Deino Mite:	isnt nidalee aslo a vastaya?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I took several turrets and got a double kill at one point, so I think I did alright
Neon Strike Kitty:	but she got banned so I ended up playing Sivir instead
Aqua033:	But Nami, Rengar, Wukong, and Ahri
Neon Strike Kitty:	I tried to play a game as adc today, to try out Xayah
Aqua033:	Well, not Xayah/Rakan
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's a shoulder, Gummy
Deino Mite:	eh, i already have xayah and she's the only one i care about
Aqua033:	For the few that actually care, Vastayans are free along with the normal free rotation
SuperGummying:	Let's just say I was in a fight
Master9000:	How do you make a should hurt?
SuperGummying:	My should hurts
Deino Mite:	they just dont know what it means
Deino Mite:	they are
Master9000:	They aren't able to read?
Deino Mite:	people sometimes ask what it is
Deino Mite:	ya i noticed that
Deino Mite:	^
Master9000:	It makes an announcement message for each person on your team that has it equipped at the start of each game <@191299047896776704>
Neon Strike Kitty:	he has quite a bit
Master9000:	How much ip does deci have he bought me xayah as well
Deino Mite:	speaking of icons, has everyone equipped the NA LCS MSI icon?
Deino Mite:	my friend gifted my xayah and i gifted my brother rakan cus i wanted the icon
Deino Mite:	oh
Neon Strike Kitty:	He gifted me both of them
Deino Mite:	for what?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've yet to give him my thanks
Neon Strike Kitty:	is Deci online?
Deino Mite:	deci, what mastery are you on xayah?
willofd2011:	I have yet to get rakan lol

Neon Strike Kitty:	Meanwhile I still haven't played Rakan
Deino Mite:	and im 1 lp away from promos
Deino Mite:	guys, i got level 6 mastery on xayah!
willofd2011:	?
Master9000:	Contagious word of the year
Neon Strike Kitty:	Oof >.<
willofd2011:	Blah this headache that I have tho it's irritating
Animal_Glue_:	sometimes
Master9000:	Melted cheese on most foods is superior to a slice or chunk of cheese
Deino Mite:	i just got a bagel from dunkin donuts and it was good
Deino Mite:	i dont like my sandwiches melted but you do you
Master9000:	Nice and melted

Kireina:	rip
Master9000:	Just walking to parent's studio from school
Master9000:	The two textbooks in my backpack don't help with that tho
Kireina:	wot
Master9000:	But it helps in order to walk off a hurt valve
Master9000:	I'm supposed to be walking 1.5 miles
Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	So I'm supposed to be writing an essay rn
Master9000:	That's not what you said last week
Kireina:	??
SuperGummying:	I knew ida was a bot
Kireina:	I drew that with my mouse :^)
Neon Strike Kitty:	that's not common with art
Kireina:	LOL
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can even recognize it as Eyan
Kireina:	Also he has some sick muscles
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao

Kireina:	Here's the party version I made of Eyan :^)

Kireina:	not like you aren't gonna be able to find
Kireina:	I mean it's a laptop
Neon Strike Kitty:	but my bed's kind of a mess so I have nowhere to put it
Kireina:	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Kireina:	😐
Neon Strike Kitty:	that might be contributing to the problem
Neon Strike Kitty:	There's also the fact that I have a laptop on my stomach
Kireina:	rip
Neon Strike Kitty:	Apparently I'm just out of practice
Kireina:	Now this may sound insensitive, but unless you have legitimate back problems or *really* fat I don't see how you can't reach that far >_>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can maybe make a 120 degree corner
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes
Kireina:	Forward?
Neon Strike Kitty:	and my back just doesn't bend that way
Neon Strike Kitty:	yes
Kireina:	?
Kireina:	It's on your legs
Neon Strike Kitty:	idk
Kireina:	What do you mean you can't reach that far
Kireina:	??
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't reach that far
Kireina:	:^)

Ayana:	​Preach, sister!

Animal_Glue_:	Is Discord your life?
Neon Strike Kitty:	sometimes I just turn Discord off
Neon Strike Kitty:	most of the time
Animal_Glue_:	WHAT

Neon Strike Kitty:	"All of these"?
Animal_Glue_:	I can't keep up with all these chats XD
Animal_Glue_:	lvl up for me pls
Neon Strike Kitty:	*banishes Gummy to the shadow realm*
Aqua033:	Banish him
Neon Strike Kitty:	Heretic!
SuperGummying:	Meh I would
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's treason
Master9000:	That's illegal
SuperGummying:	Same for a dog
SuperGummying:	Move the cat?
SuperGummying:	I always cross my leg
Neon Strike Kitty:	I have my legs crossed and my cat is directly on top
SuperGummying:	Why
Neon Strike Kitty:	and they're being squished
Neon Strike Kitty:	there's a cat on them
Neon Strike Kitty:	My feet are dying
Master9000:	Go do homework or something

Master9000:	Then no
Aqua033:	It's an anime
Master9000:	Who
Aqua033:	I should finish Tanya the Evil
Neon Strike Kitty:	Getting Robo to act sick is bloody hilarious
Neon Strike Kitty:	Speaking of rocking opening songs, Log Horizon and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works both have great ones
Aqua033:	As does Re:Creators
JelloHammer:	Highschool DxD has a surprisingly rocking opening song
Aqua033:	I'm probably just gonna jungle control my way out of bronze myself
Aqua033:	Ah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I have to actually learn jungle first
Neon Strike Kitty:	but it's like
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wanna get into playing jungle Leona
Aqua033:	Bronze is a rollercoaster.
Aqua033:	I actually had the displeasure of having to play with a Leona jungle last night
Neon Strike Kitty:	u wot m8?
Aqua033:	Eh, not quite as bad as Leona Jungle
Noex:	But Jayce jungle is a first
Noex:	I've seen Gragas support so I wasn't surprised bout that
Master9000:	What about gragas support <@!128388878947057664> ?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't think it's happened to me but I've worried so much about it happening
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, I understand the pain
Aqua033:	The sad thing was, it *was* an online assignment
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sivir's always a good time for me, I guess
Neon Strike Kitty:	Only the enemy jungler had more
Neon Strike Kitty:	First time in ages I play adc and get the highest cs on the team
Noex:	Jungle Jayce was played in Korea
Noex:	RIP Solo Queue again
Noex:	Btw
Master9000:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473> that's why online assignments are nice u just upload it as soon as you're done
Aqua033:	Tfw I got an assignment done on time but I kept forgetting to turn it in so it ended up being two weeks late
Deino Mite:	i might. ill have to think of a good character
Neon Strike Kitty:	I did it just for the thematic
Neon Strike Kitty:	Nah

Neon Strike Kitty:	*coughs*
Deino Mite:	Magus is Chrono's brother?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I can't really support a decision to kill my brother, so.... 😛
Deino Mite:	thats what i was planning on. Eyan said to do that too
Neon Strike Kitty:	Get him to the team
Deino Mite:	what should i do?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think you should know what I think you should do
Deino Mite:	i think im at the part where you choose if Magus joins your team or not
Deino Mite:	i remember trying to beat them
Deino Mite:	the golem sisters are so annoying
Neon Strike Kitty:	Now I can progress in this bloody game
Neon Strike Kitty:	Hooray!
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yay, I beat the Golem Sisters!

JelloHammer:	lol fair enough
Necro:	That boring as hell if I wanted to watch mutation I would watch the music video for the song forced gender reassignment by cattle decapitation. No I want to be the one doing the stabbing and gutting of weak thoughtless fools
JelloHammer:	You could just watch corpse party lol
JelloHammer:	I mean
Necro:	Just was bored and violent mutilation always entertains me

Aqua033:	
Master9000:	Ill be back later if anyone needs me, @me and ill respond when im back
Deino Mite:	ya but the 50% is quite a bit when you have a few ad items. i typically go er pd and ie  cus i like the cdr from er and it does a ton of e damage because er and ie give ad
Master9000:	notice how its getting spammy in <#305548986155008000>
Master9000:	i learned all the bots we have specifically
Neon Strike Kitty:	You really like 'em music bots
Master9000:	everyone able to send messages in the text channel thru which the bot joined can queue up songs
Master9000:	yeah you queue up songs and it plays everything until the queue runs out
Zek:	is this bot automatic or? <@!162952008712716288>
Master9000:	default is 100
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> i have it set to 3% lol
Master9000:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Deci:	which will make the 50% damage increase less worth it
Deci:	it's a 50% damage increase at 100% crit, so you'll be sacrificing a lot of AD to make it that high
Deci:	the crit scaling on her e is actually not that super
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Neon Strike Kitty leveled up!**
Neon Strike Kitty:	>5 tags in the server
Deino Mite:	she's best when she has her crit items. the crit scaling on e is ansane
Kireina:	Xayah laning phase is insane xd
Kireina:	lol
Deino Mite:	and fizz is just fizz
Deino Mite:	shen stacked armor
Deino Mite:	enemy shen and fizz got fed
Deino Mite:	finally lost a game as xayah
Deci:	it's np
Aqua033:	Thanks
Aqua033:	Alright, Deci
Kireina:	oki have fun I'll be on stream later
Deci:	Gotcha
Kireina:	Nuu
KingofZeal:	Stream is live, done reading discord for now
Kireina:	D:
Deci:	into a tasty steak or good burger
Deci:	and it burns just like any other deer
Kireina:	Bambi is a deer
Master9000:	or bambis into spirit if you still like the aoe burn
BreeZaps:	chips and candy I might try to find soemthing new
Kireina:	but idk what to try
Kireina:	I've been trying to find something new
Kireina:	What kind of snacks do you like?
Deci:	And just learn to not die, awua :P. Being serious for a moment, if you suffer not being able to play tanks, get a rune-page with all armor and mr, then build sunfire first in a physical lane and spirit visage in a magical lane
BreeZaps:	it's a 5 min walk
BreeZaps:	Gonna go buy a snack at my local store for this stream
Kireina:	I would definitely say that they have a learning curve, but nothing insane imo other then knowing matchups or just your own limitations like dmg etc.
Master9000:	its ok ill feed this one so its over fast <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deci:	Gotcha eyan
Aqua033:	Even Darius.
KingofZeal:	Deci, check with me before going into another game, may play the next one
Aqua033:	Yep.
Deci:	you suck at tanks?
Kireina:	That is quite odd
Kugallyblitz:	On my phone, Samsung S7 btw, i can watch eyan just fine, but my oher friends when I watch them it's just a black screen, no audio too. so that's weird, only on my phone though
Aqua033:	I suck at tanks.
Kireina:	no idea then xD
Kireina:	Rip that sucks
Kireina:	I remember that twitch said something about there android phone app having problems
Kugallyblitz:	Nope, on pc
Kireina:	Were you on your phone?
Kireina:	Cooking streams would be sick
Kugallyblitz:	twitch for some reaons wasn't working earlier today, like I'll click on a vod and it wont play, just blank white screen, anyone else get this from time to ime?
KingofZeal:	Gonna say no on cooking streams, lol
Kireina:	Granted I won't be able to show up to stream cause I'm at my local community college now xd
Master9000:	i like it
Zek:	Yo i'd be up for a cooking with Eyan stream idk about you? <@!304073163669766158>
BreeZaps:	okay
BreeZaps:	We want to watch u work lol
KingofZeal:	Let me go toss on a presentable shirt and I'll toss up stream
Kireina:	Or just use us as a means of bouncing ideas to
BreeZaps:	I am down for it.
Demon Lord 93:	I'm down for that
Dragonite:	i need to go cook dinner in like fifteen minutes idk
Kireina:	Could always do a IRL stream and just talk while you work on discord stuff or something ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
KingofZeal:	I make no promises of how good this stream will be, I kinda wanted to work on my channel
Master9000:	we can do rifts
Master9000:	please do eyan
BreeZaps:	You can have a bot that stays in a channel and plays music.
Master9000:	and use the music bot commands since theyre spamm
KingofZeal:	I could stream if enough people are bored but I don't know what I'd do, lol
Deci:	it's because league is my life
Kireina:	Well we could add a music channel. Basically a place where people can just post music they like  etc. etc.
Deci:	if it seems like I talk about league a lot
Master9000:	since day 1 hype
Master9000:	eyan delayed the music bot so it doesnt exist yet
Kireina:	Or even a music bot? :^)
Kireina:	Have we considered adding a music channel? 😮
Deci:	anybody else?
Deci:	We're all bored? master and I are doing league right now
Aqua033:	Same
Dragonite:	_pokes Bree_
BreeZaps:	<:pauseCorndog:284220276894466049> I'm bored
KingofZeal:	And I'm aware of limiting tts by role, lol
Dragonite:	fun times
BreeZaps:	<:galacticBLUSH:284219031395893248>
KingofZeal:	Yea Dragonite
Kireina:	^
Kinesis (Aaron):	You can also limit it to certain roles or people
Kireina:	But anyways like I was saying Idk how you would do it, but I have a friend who connected his Mee6 bot to announce whenever he was streaming
Dragonite:	A little late but <@!304073163669766158> would the new text channel be sort of like the AMA from the days of old?
Zek:	<@!304073163669766158> You can enable tts for that chat only btw
Kireina:	For future reference
KingofZeal:	Fair enough
Kireina:	Also, <@!304073163669766158> @everyone announces to everyone who is on and offline, while @here announces only to those that are currently online on discord
Deci:	cuz it doesn't belong there
Deci:	deleted my own message
KingofZeal:	Lol
Zek:	<@!304073163669766158> Didn't hear the noise. The test failed
Kugallyblitz:	I got the notification, just not tts eyan
Master9000:	nope no tts but got the notif
Kinesis (Aaron):	I turned mine off, but it goes to everyone in the current chat <@!304073163669766158>
KingofZeal:	Did that work?
Kireina:	I know that Mee 6 bot can be connected to your stream I believe (or something similar) and will announce to everyone that you are streaming with a link to your stream
Master9000:	ill stay here u send a msg on the board
Master9000:	test it
Zek:	holyshitisthatsuperskarmoryomgomgimbigsub
KingofZeal:	Does tts hit everyone if I tag it with @everyone?
KingofZeal:	But htis is the main channel, so it's likely it'd hit most people
Master9000:	could do `@everyone` in royal message board
KingofZeal:	Yea, that's the issue
Aqua033:	You could also just ping @ everyone.
Master9000:	but doesnt that only work when people are in the according channel?
KingofZeal:	Like when I'm streaming
Kireina:	Will yell nearly anything and everything
KingofZeal:	I actually would like to use tts when making semi-important announcements
Kugallyblitz:	I'm afriad to tts anyways cos I'm afriad that I'll irratate everyone lol
Kireina:	So if anyone needs some tts I gotchu <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deci:	Twas not me
Kireina:	I'm like if I want tts, I'll do it myself by yelling everything thats typed in chat
Master9000:	i blame the person who first used tts here <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deci:	damn
Master9000:	nobody usues them on camelot so we never bothered disabling them lmao
Kireina:	For everything xd
Aqua033:	Same
Kireina:	I muted tts
Kireina:	lol
Deci:	probably
KingofZeal:	I should probably turn tts off in this channel, even for mods, lol
Master9000:	expected
Kireina:	And then I give it away by typing <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Deci:	We Do Not Forgive. We Do Not Forget. Expect Us.
Master9000:	*sneaky sneaky*
Kugallyblitz:	"meanie head"
Kireina:	^
Aqua033:	I just go invisible when I want peace tbh :^)
KingofZeal:	The only reason I started talking was cause of Lightning
KingofZeal:	I'm red cause I don't want to be disturbed right now, lol
Kireina:	Level 3 0:
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **KingofZeal leveled up!**
KingofZeal:	I do mute notifcations
Kireina:	*throws boxes at you*
Master9000:	btw eyan you can also mute notifications instead of going red so that if theres something important thru here u can still get it in dm's or such
Aqua033:	I want to ; ;
Kireina:	gimme
Kireina:	no stoop it ;n;
Aqua033:	Sorry, 11 now
Kireina:	FeelsBadMan
Aqua033:	I have 10 keys
Kireina:	but no keys
Kireina:	I have 17 hextexh boxes
Kireina:	rip I have the opposite problem
Aqua033:	I keep getting key fragments but I have nothing to use them on help ; ;
Kireina:	I mean the only person that would get anything negative is you and/or the person who wants to talk to you(more privately), but they can just shoot a pm on discord so I mean. Try and see it how you like it I guess
Kugallyblitz:	I wonder how that would work, but I don't disapprove of it.
Deino Mite:	also, i think the messaging you chat is a good idea
Deino Mite:	if you want to copy that summary to the message board eyan, feel free to
KingofZeal:	I'll implement it into things later, just wanted to pass the idea by ya'll
Kugallyblitz:	huh,  i think it'd be innteresting
Kireina:	^
Deino Mite:	Here's a basic summary of the icon thing: Starting today and going until the end of MSI, you can buy a special icon for your region for 1 ip in the shop. By playing games with this icon, you earn points for your region. The region with the most points as well as the region who wins MSI gets an ip weekend and a special MSI icon.
Deci:	"Court of Zeal"
Master9000:	<@!304073163669766158> notlikethis
KingofZeal:	Nah, I don't think I could privatize it, lol
Kireina:	I mean I only see positives so i don't see why not
Kugallyblitz:	but more private
KingofZeal:	Sort of like highlighting my name in twitch chat
Kugallyblitz:	seems like a good idea
KingofZeal:	Suggestions, any direct comments really
Kugallyblitz:	That would be good actually, Eyan
Aqua033:	Couldn't *hurt.*
KingofZeal:	Like, place to ask questions or yeah, what you said
Kireina:	just about anything or like suggestions etc.
Master9000:	could be nice
Kireina:	Talk to you how so
KingofZeal:	Do you guys think I should make a text channel specifically designed to talk to me?  The idea crossed my mind last night
Kireina:	lol
Deino Mite:	but ip weekend is more important
Deino Mite:	i wanted to equip the xayah and rakan icon
Deino Mite:	ya
Lightning:	gah, the sacrifice must be made then for free IP weekend
Deino Mite:	no
Lightning:	can you equip it for like a minute then take it off?
Lightning:	dang
Deino Mite:	you have to equip it
Deino Mite:	save the meme
Lightning:	So this icon, do you have to equip it? Or do you just have to buy it?
Deino Mite:	dont get it yet then
Deino Mite:	lol
KingofZeal:	I have exactly over 9000 IP it would ruin everything
Lightning:	oh god
KingofZeal:	Wait, I can't get the icon for 1 IP
Kugallyblitz:	aah, gotcha. lel
KingofZeal:	Let's just say the royal bedroom will be interesting tonight.  😃
Lightning:	Wait who defied the laws of this blessed land?
Kugallyblitz:	what's one's punishment for calling the king a meanie?
Deino Mite:	the region with the most people equipping it gets an ip weekend
KingofZeal:	Oh
Deino Mite:	its 1 ip
KingofZeal:	Don't have RP
KingofZeal:	For it was you who failed to embrace my kindness and passion by defying the laws of this blessed land
Kugallyblitz:	Eyan got some pretty serious allegations a few minutes ago
Deino Mite:	and equip it
Deino Mite:	eyan, get he na lcs icon
Kugallyblitz:	xD
KingofZeal:	I would like to refute the fact that you called me a meanie
Kugallyblitz:	yeah, I'd recommend that show, may not be the best but my good lord is it addicting
Lightning:	Yeah I've seen glimpses off and on when my parents are watching it and I just happen to be passing by
Kugallyblitz:	it's amazing, in season 12 reid is... in trouble to say the least
Lightning:	Oh yeah my parents love that show, I used to watch it with them back when it first aired
Kugallyblitz:	criminal minds, very good show
Lightning:	Any recommendations?
Kugallyblitz:	netflix is awesome
Lightning:	I'll be in and out, I just got home from an appointment so I'm having an early dinner. Might watch some stuff on Netflix
Lightning:	ty for the heads up
Lightning:	I'll get on and buy mine now
Deino Mite:	ok
Aqua033:	We already did
Lightning:	Allergies suck, can speak from experience. I used to like spring but then allergies happened
Deino Mite:	cus i dont 😦
Deino Mite:	can someone with powers send an @ everyone with that
Deino Mite:	everyone, make sure to buy the NA LCS MSI icon and equip it so we can get an ip weekend
Kugallyblitz:	allergies make my face itch, and all that good stuff, also I become irritable when this happens. ech
Aqua033:	3 of the 5 of us died.
Aqua033:	...My team just did a 20 minute baron.
Deino Mite:	the worst part is the it makes my nose all pimply cus im constantly itching my nose
Deino Mite:	ya
Kugallyblitz:	allergies... man, that sucks
Kugallyblitz:	hahaha
Kugallyblitz:	because he's a meanie
Kugallyblitz:	Oh i knew it was you lightning, hope you're doing well today
Deino Mite:	good. had to go back to school today and had really bad allergies. other than that its good
Lightning:	It's Lightning btw, Eyan took the Lightning out of my name cause he's a meanie head
Kugallyblitz:	Howdy! doing good, could be better, another off day, but dont let me ruin your day :^)

Kinesis (Aaron):	I heard the tts go off while trying to set up nba2k-

Deci:	i wonder how many people had this open and just had the "this asshole" thought go through their heads

Master9000:	Which one is worse tho, the dating or the driving advice lmao
Kugallyblitz:	lol, yeah in all seriousness that isnt a very good idea haha
Master9000:	Is don't take gummy's advice.
Master9000:	The most important rule out of that discussion that came up again
Kugallyblitz:	or bella
Kugallyblitz:	See ya heronerd
superheronerd:	Have readings to do
superheronerd:	Alright guys, I'll see you later.
Kugallyblitz:	but that's your choice
Kugallyblitz:	If it's an emergency, cars can easily pull over and stop lol
SuperGummying:	I leant my lesson
superheronerd:	Doing anything but driving while driving is a terrible thing
Deci:	exactly
Kugallyblitz:	It's better to lose a minute of your life than your life in a minute.
Deci:	it's like #1 way to get killed on the road
Kugallyblitz:	texting and driving is never a good idea
Deci:	seriously don't text and drive
SuperGummying:	Even though it's fun
SuperGummying:	Also don't text and drive
SuperGummying:	Otherwise you may get arrested
SuperGummying:	Anyways stop in the middle of road but make cars don't come
Deci:	cya jello
superheronerd:	Goodnight jello!
Deci:	gotcha
JelloHammer:	Cya all in a bit!
SuperGummying:	Night jello
JelloHammer:	Alrighty people, I'm off to bed for the night
SuperGummying:	Stop in the middle of the road to play Pokemon go
SuperGummying:	Blitz remember
Kugallyblitz:	lol
Kugallyblitz:	Driving in gta is way easier than in real life.
Kugallyblitz:	I'll get over it hopefully. lol
JelloHammer:	Seriously though, good luck buddy
JelloHammer:	Public Transportation
superheronerd:	You can do it, blitz 😎
JelloHammer:	two words
Deci:	Yikes. Good luck kugally
Kugallyblitz:	driving is gonna be an interesting experience for me, prolly cos of my huge fear of cars in general
Deci:	Don't let anybody tell you otherwise
SuperGummying:	Don't worry I drive 6 miles per hour
JelloHammer:	lol
JelloHammer:	are they playing it wrong?
Deci:	They're wrong
JelloHammer:	but they're still having fun
JelloHammer:	If someone is playing a game the exact opposite way you're supposed to play it
Deci:	Good thing I didn't bet anything
JelloHammer:	Thats a question
SuperGummying:	And get this I didn't run anyone over
SuperGummying:	Yeah it did
Deci:	Did it work? I bet it didn't
SuperGummying:	I learn how to drive through gta
SuperGummying:	Hey that's what I did
Deci:	Some do, yeah
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **JelloHammer leveled up!**
JelloHammer:	Playing Minecraft for construction education is like playing GTA to figure out how to drive.
superheronerd:	Don't people use minecraft to code or something?
Neon Strike Kitty:	*it doesn't make a difference*
Neon Strike Kitty:	so it's half wood, half dirt
Neon Strike Kitty:	I ran out of wood for my house so I put dirt instead
SuperGummying:	Imma build my house out of wool
Kinesis (Aaron):	XD
SuperGummying:	Yup
Kinesis (Aaron):	^^^
JelloHammer:	Minecraft houses =/= Real houses
JelloHammer:	Gummy
SuperGummying:	Yup I'm learning how to build houses
JelloHammer:	About how seeing the high proficiency and passion someone else has at what they do is what inspires you to do the same in that same field.
Neon Strike Kitty:	Educational purposes?
SuperGummying:	I don't have fun
SuperGummying:	I play Minecraft for educational purposes
JelloHammer:	I thought of something the other day
Neon Strike Kitty:	You're doing a good job of it
Deci:	Keyword being try
Deci:	I try to be reasonable
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm too used to heavy bias
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's kind of nice for a change to have a discussion with reasonable people
Deci:	It happens, look at the mine craft discussion yesterday. Some people brought up points and others we're like "that's why I like the game"
superheronerd:	I think that's pretty interesting
Deci:	'Twas my point
Neon Strike Kitty:	and apparently vice versa
Neon Strike Kitty:	but the parts of SS you disliked, I was fine with
Neon Strike Kitty:	Eh, fair enough
Deci:	This why I wasn't belittling it
Deci:	So are yours, ida
Neon Strike Kitty:	I feel like your problems with SS are kind of completely.... which is the word? Objective or subjective?
Master9000:	I have skyward sword somewhere in my house but I haven't unpacked it since we moved
Deci:	Funnily enough BOTW made the stamina wheel right
Neon Strike Kitty:	and the bloody magic beans!
Deci:	My problems with SS are the supporting cast (only the navi replacement is really any good, and even she's annoying), the dungeons feel samy and the motion controls and stamina bar are just stupid ideas.
Neon Strike Kitty:	and Ikana Castle had a bombable ceiling that I had no way of knowing about so I had to backtrack for a powder keg
Neon Strike Kitty:	I had to go through like 7 rooms in the Snowpeak Temple because I screwed one puzzle up
Deci:	I could agree with you Ida, but I probably have different issues with SS than you, because I don't mind backtracking
Neon Strike Kitty:	*backtracking*
superheronerd:	One I'm forgetting the name of was really enjoyable too
SuperGummying:	Oh yeah I used a guide for oot and people got mad at me
JelloHammer:	The only issue I can see myself having with MM is the constant stress of being on a timer
Neon Strike Kitty:	but it's not one of the best games of all time like people say it is
Neon Strike Kitty:	I loved it
Neon Strike Kitty:	I have played OoT
superheronerd:	OoT was pretty boss tho.
SuperGummying:	And mm
SuperGummying:	Play oot
Neon Strike Kitty:	Namely, *backtracking*
Neon Strike Kitty:	because every problem I have with SS, MM has the same ones on a bigger scale
Deci:	I want a switch so badly
Deci:	Skyward sword was a good game with too many tacked on gimmicks and fails to really be worth it. It's a 6/10 type of game, but with literally 4 changes it coulda been 8/10
superheronerd:	I don't think I'll get to play breath of the wild ):
JelloHammer:	which apparently seems to be out of stock everywhere
Neon Strike Kitty:	I personally loved Skyward Sword and hated MM
JelloHammer:	buying a switch
JelloHammer:	only issue is
Neon Strike Kitty:	Skyward Sword was fun
JelloHammer:	From what I've been hearing BOtW is pretty damn good too
superheronerd:	Yeah, you're right.
Deci:	Willl*
Deci:	And hello wil
JelloHammer:	yeah
superheronerd:	Skyward sword left much to be desired, to me.
Deci:	Don't start with majoras mask , it's not user friendly play it second or third
willofd2011:	Hi deci lol ^w^
Deci:	And jello, you already know I'm a big fan of shizune over even hanako, and she's pretty much rin
superheronerd:	A great one to start would be ocarina of time or majoras mask.
JelloHammer:	was it really as bad as they say?
JelloHammer:	I've seen a lot of people harp on skywrd sword
Deci:	Except skyward sword
Deci:	The Zelda series is highly acclaimed for a reason. All of them are really good and you should dedicate the rest of your life to playing them in atonement
superheronerd:	I think, blitz, it is definitely something that should be on your list to play
JelloHammer:	But Hanako is more of the "ZOMG MUST PROTECT" kind of character
JelloHammer:	I feel like Sakura is like Hanako in some respects
Deci:	At least IMO, because drive and dedication are extremely important traits to me
Aqua033:	Yes
Deci:	Sakura is cute but she'll never amount to anything. No drive or determination. She'd be a great friend but not a very good gf/wife
JelloHammer:	I honestly cant choose atm, but im saving my final verdict on sakura until after Heaven's feel
Kugallyblitz:	I've never played zelda... should I get professional help?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Archer or Lancer?
Neon Strike Kitty:	Alright Deci
superheronerd:	Zelda is always good topic for discussion
Deci:	And definitely rin
Deci:	We hijacked your thread
JelloHammer:	rin or sakura?
JelloHammer:	okay heres a question deci
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was talking about Zelda
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm a bit of a Zelda nerd
Neon Strike Kitty:	I was talking about Zelda
Deci:	I haven't watched past season 4 either
JelloHammer:	always wearing headphones? Sounds like super sonico
SuperGummying:	Haven't had time to watch
SuperGummying:	I'm still on season 5
Deci:	The one always wearing he headphones. Also she's the one that had a boss music teaser for the film
Deci:	Yup
SuperGummying:	Vinyl I think was the one that helped them durning the movie rainbow rocks
Deci:	Not quite as rare as derpy
Deci:	More like Octavia
JelloHammer:	like derpy?
Deci:	Sadly she's a pretty rare background character
JelloHammer:	not gonna lie
JelloHammer:	vinyl scratch seems pretty rad though
Kugallyblitz:	huh, this is new to me
Aqua033:	I should play it.
Deci:	It's cool, twilight princess is a boss game
Aqua033:	Because I know absolutely nothing about MLP
Deci:	Same Aqua. I thought that as well
SuperGummying:	See deci agrees with me
Deci:	Yes
Aqua033:	When you said Twilight Princess I thought you were talking about Zelda
JelloHammer:	twilight sparkle is cool
SuperGummying:	Apple jack should be the one you insult
Deci:	Twilight sparkle
JelloHammer:	I dont know mlp much lel
Deci:	No
JelloHammer:	i thought you meant the book series
Deci:	Jello take that back
JelloHammer:	she's cool
JelloHammer:	oh that twilight
Deci:	Daaaamn, you did not just insult 3rd best pony
Neon Strike Kitty:	I like Twilight Princess
SuperGummying:	I like twilight though
JelloHammer:	Anything is better than twilight <:LUL:305559915714576385>
JelloHammer:	vinyl scratch
Deci:	Sup
Kugallyblitz:	howdy deci
Kugallyblitz:	hello
Deci:	Vinyl scratch or twilight
JelloHammer:	n3rds
SuperGummying:	Kiddies
Neon Strike Kitty:	nerds
SuperGummying:	(Totally don't have crush on her)
SuperGummying:	Rarity is my favourite
JelloHammer:	she's my favourite <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
JelloHammer:	eyy Fluttershy
willofd2011:	Lol
JelloHammer:	but it does
JelloHammer:	I have no clue why it exists
SuperGummying:	
Neon Strike Kitty:	What the actual
superheronerd:	Oh jeez
Kugallyblitz:	noice
JelloHammer:	SeemsGood
JelloHammer:	
BreeZaps:	tbh it does sound good
BreeZaps:	I could buy jello power and get gummy bears. I can make the jello and half way through I can throw in the gummys
JelloHammer:	this is a bit sudden
Kinesis (Aaron):	k-
Kinesis (Aaron):	um-
JelloHammer:	um
SuperGummying:	I want to eat um gummy bears
BreeZaps:	I want to eat jello
SuperGummying:	Read what I wrote in the other server lol
Kugallyblitz:	Aww, gummy, I hope it's not as bad as you say
SuperGummying:	School is no fun when you're me
superheronerd:	It's pretty strange
Kinesis (Aaron):	We all feel old to an extent-
superheronerd:	My high school just had their senior prom this weekend, and mine was last year. I feel old
JelloHammer:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYDfwUJzYQg
JelloHammer:	Speaking of Primus
Neon Strike Kitty:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayS6pnvr41E
Kugallyblitz:	wow I can't compete Im a freshman high school  😐
Neon Strike Kitty:	I just linked it because I had it open
JelloHammer:	reminds me of Primus' version of 'The Devil Went Down to Georgia'
JelloHammer:	also, that phoenix wright bgm is really nice
JelloHammer:	im almost a sophomore
Kinesis (Aaron):	I'm just a High School Sophmore
superheronerd:	I'm barely in college freshman English
JelloHammer:	Im in university
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm graduating >.>
Kinesis (Aaron):	im just trying to get to the nba as a ref, nothing fancy-
Kinesis (Aaron):	ppfffttt-
superheronerd:	You guys sound like a pretty smart group to me
superheronerd:	Oh boy, school.
JelloHammer:	I've always thought that this song sounds similar to Dancing Mad from FF
JelloHammer:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MshUFnfEfeA
JelloHammer:	For those of you that like video game-y music, I recommend Dream Theatre. They are amazing
Kugallyblitz:	Music is a good thing to listen to whilst doing work
Kugallyblitz:	I personally don't like this type of music, but I can recognize that this is a very talented group. Nice!
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
JelloHammer:	Carcass were way ahead of their time
JelloHammer:	Released in 1991 too
Kireina:	Pretty bangin 😮
Kinesis (Aaron):	that thumbnail-
JelloHammer:	I haven't been able to stop listening to this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vwYqEihTpQ
Kugallyblitz:	we're pretty much talkin about school stuffz
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Neon Strike Kitty:	I miss a lot of things here
Kireina:	Just depends on what you want to do mainly
Kireina:	I mean languages are relevant
Kinesis (Aaron):	Like seriously?
Kinesis (Aaron):	In Spanish or Chinese too?
Kugallyblitz:	Like, how many times are you gonna ask "May I use the restroom?" at work?
Kugallyblitz:	Most of what you learn in school you probably won't use in a standard profession or job
Kireina:	^
Kugallyblitz:	I mean, as long as you are proficient then that's good. I've never done stat sheets before. That'll be exciting, but I'm glad you are doing well at what you do
Neon Strike Kitty:	https://youtu.be/mlplSTKri9Y
Kireina:	Stat sheets aren't even that hard
Kinesis (Aaron):	Not for a Sophmore in High School. Doing stat sheets seem rarer then the moon turning blue
Kugallyblitz:	thats good
Kinesis (Aaron):	I have no clue why
Kugallyblitz:	Out of ALL of the essays this year I got 100% on like 13/15 of them, so my grade average for essays is like 90 or so
Kinesis (Aaron):	What I find weird is that I suck at essay's and stuff like that, but I do really well with like stat sheets
Kireina:	Concisely
Kireina:	Because I argued why does it matter how long an essay so long as i convey the message
Kugallyblitz:	Essays are not fun, but I'm very good at them
Kireina:	Although, my teacher has been willing to cooperate with me
Kireina:	I just get straight to the point
Kinesis (Aaron):	^^^^
Kireina:	I mostly struggle cause my essay's are never long enough ~_~
Kugallyblitz:	Math was one of those subjects where I didn't find it useful, but understood it for some reason, so I applied myself to it and I now I have the highest grade in my grade with like 103%. Yeah... lol
Kireina:	And english on the other hand makes me cry
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Aaron the Riolu leveled up!**
Kinesis (Aaron):	I just suck at school overall now.
Kireina:	But I look back and it's probably because I just straight didn't pay attention to anything whatsoever
Kugallyblitz:	English for me was one of those subjects where I was good at some of it, bad at the remaining 1/3, and got away with a 96%
Kireina:	The only class I ever struggled with as Algebra for some reason
Kinesis (Aaron):	But that passed on after like 7th grade
Kinesis (Aaron):	I used to be good in English, as much as I don't like it
Kugallyblitz:	Yeah, math isn't that hard, then again our minds thrive at different subjects. So don't feel too bad Buze.
Kinesis (Aaron):	i will never understand-
Kireina:	Then again math is really easy to me
Kireina:	I mean I have an A without doing much of the work
Kinesis (Aaron):	I suck at math, so calculus is most likely gonna be hell for me
Kugallyblitz:	and good luck with your class
Kugallyblitz:	huh, well that's cool. Calculus looks like a really cool subject
Kireina:	Well I'm taking College Calc 2/3 (not too sure they are vague)
Kugallyblitz:	is it all just pretty easy or gone over and trivial
Kireina:	It's just we aren't doing anything
Kireina:	Well theres tons of things
Kinesis (Aaron):	Doesn't seem like there's much to pay attention to-
Kinesis (Aaron):	Well, I see why you're not paying attention now
Kireina:	Currently, Calculus
Kugallyblitz:	what class are you in?
Kireina:	How about you xd
willofd2011:	For someone who is used to rolling with brown and black belts during my judo days it's kinda hard to go easy on people lol
Kireina:	Not bad, just been talking to you guys and not paying attention in class xd
Kugallyblitz:	how is your guys' day goin?
Kinesis (Aaron):	Hai
Kugallyblitz:	and hello buze
Kugallyblitz:	no problem
willofd2011:	Hi bree ^w^
Kinesis (Aaron):	So much for that idea then-
Kinesis (Aaron):	Welp-
BreeZaps:	Just call me Bree
BreeZaps:	Hi
Kugallyblitz:	Hello breezaps
BreeZaps:	To people here I am only friending people on discord that I'm friends with.
willofd2011:	I might've hurt them a bit tho lol
Kireina:	Then it ain't rough :^)
willofd2011:	Nope lol
Kireina:	did you break someone's bones? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kireina:	Now the question is
willofd2011:	Being a bit too rough when performing a technique
Kireina:	Well I assume some things require a partner
Kugallyblitz:	Sometimes it's best to just do work alone
Kireina:	What'd you do to scare them?
willofd2011:	I think I scared off a handful of people making then not really want to be my partner and whatnot lol
Kireina:	good luck <@136689448225210368>
Kugallyblitz:	alright Awua
Aqua033:	BRB Science
willofd2011:	Mhm lol
Kugallyblitz:	seems fun actually
Kugallyblitz:	that doesn't seem bad
willofd2011:	Well if it's like how the judo finals are it's more like the teacher naming out a technique and we have to perform it lol
Kugallyblitz:	I would not be very happy, very nervous actually taking that self defence exam.
willofd2011:	Lol
Kireina:	LOL
Kugallyblitz:	"Yes this is your self defence exam, in this exam many attackers will be on their way to attack you. You must defend yourself, if you die you fail. Capeesh?"
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
willofd2011:	Why? Aren't most colleges like that? Lol
Kireina:	I want that class
Kireina:	wot
Kireina:	Self defense
Kugallyblitz:	will your school seems very interesting
Kugallyblitz:	but what's cool is IF I happen to fail any tests I won't be held back, I'll just have to take it again next year. btw I've never been held back, just nervous this year Dx
willofd2011:	Like the first final I have to do is for self defense and all we have to do is perform certain techniques
Aqua033:	I'm usually good at math, but God damn, screw geometry
Kugallyblitz:	math and science are what I'm good at
Kugallyblitz:	the only state test I'm nervous for is english
willofd2011:	It just depends on the class for me lol
Aqua033:	They're just a bunch of multiple choice questions
Aqua033:	Finals are easy here
Kireina:	I finished most of my finals, I just got AP Tests left
Kugallyblitz:	oh nice, the state tests are surprisingly the easier tests, they have to bundle everything you learned this year, so they can't just throw every HARD problem of every subject... just what you learned. which is great
Aqua033:	We have standardized tests but I don't have to take any this year because I took Algebra last year
Aqua033:	Ah
Kugallyblitz:	This week isn't really "finals" but they are the mandatory state tests. Finals are like the last few days of school, once you finish, school is done for you. it's really nice
Kireina:	damn
Aqua033:	We take our finals in the last couple days of school
Kugallyblitz:	Im online schooled, I could go to the 11 AM math class, but I'll just go to the 2 PM one, so I get a huge break
Aqua033:	Just science left
willofd2011:	Me neither but I have a final in about 2 and a half hours
Aqua033:	Luckily I'm almost done
Kireina:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Aqua033:	Same
Kugallyblitz:	oh wow haha
Kireina:	but here I am at school xd
Kireina:	same
willofd2011:	Lol
Kugallyblitz:	I am not ready to get up for school again. lol
Aqua033:	Morning
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Kugallyblitz leveled up!**
Kugallyblitz:	morning guys
willofd2011:	Lol what's up ^w^
Neon Strike Kitty:	Morning *looks at clock*
willofd2011:	Good morning ^w^
Neon Strike Kitty:	but he's dangerous in that he can conseal his presence and kill someone in one hit
Neon Strike Kitty:	The True Assassin's not that powerful in a fight vs a Servant, since his combat abilities are fitting for an Assassin class servant
Neon Strike Kitty:	You mean the actual king Hassan or the True Assassin from Fate/Stay Night?
Neon Strike Kitty:	True Assassin?
Kireina:	hm oki
JelloHammer:	fate/zero kinda just throws you into it
JelloHammer:	but fate/stay night explains things well for first timers
JelloHammer:	Fate/Zero being a prequel and an exception
JelloHammer:	Pretty much separate Timelines
Kireina:	Are they not a chronological series or are they just like different timelines?
JelloHammer:	and that was not bad
JelloHammer:	I watched it in the order of Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero and then fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works
Kireina:	Which is the only thing stopping me from starting it xd
Kireina:	Idk what order to watch them either
Kireina:	I don't know anything about fate/stay ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
JelloHammer:	i suppose this is directed towards <@!141255588846895105> lol
JelloHammer:	is he really that strong?
JelloHammer:	But fate zero barely shows any of him
JelloHammer:	I've seen many people rate the True Assassin (Hassan) as a very powerul one
JelloHammer:	One question regarding Fate
Kireina:	Yeah I do
JelloHammer:	Cu chulainn ofc
JelloHammer:	I mean
Neon Strike Kitty:	Cu > Scathach
JelloHammer:	*adds to ever-growing list of waifus*
JelloHammer:	Wow.
JelloHammer:	I just looked up Scathach from Fate and uh...
Neon Strike Kitty:	So you recognize it compared to my League name, maybe?
Kireina:	brb
Kireina:	It's similar enough
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's a bad habit
Neon Strike Kitty:	I use a different name pretty much everywhere
Kireina:	xd
Kireina:	Neon Strike Kitty#7107
JelloHammer:	at least not <@!141255588846895105> 's
JelloHammer:	i dont think its the twitch username tho
Kireina:	(what you would use to add people)
Kireina:	Well It shows your username
Neon Strike Kitty:	How did clicking on it help, though?
Kireina:	I mean considering I had to actually click on your name to figure out who you are. I would say that, yeah. xD
Kireina:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Neon Strike Kitty:	And I'm not recognizable >.>
Kireina:	so long as you know, you are recognizable
Neon Strike Kitty:	I take it he heard the Spartacus story? Heh
Kireina:	He had no qualms with changing your own
Kireina:	Aside from mods
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's just mods and admins that can change nicknames
Neon Strike Kitty:	So be sure you have something you don't mind going by when it happens
Kireina:	From what I understood yesterday he just didn't want people to have the ability to change *other* people's nicknames
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think Eyan meant to disable nickname permissions
Kireina:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kireina:	:^)
JelloHammer:	Silence.
Kireina:	Guess I can live free now
JelloHammer:	and then
JelloHammer:	I heard a beeping noise
Kireina:	Very unfortunate
Kireina:	rip
JelloHammer:	I think <@!162952008712716288> is ded
JelloHammer:	riperoni
Kireina:	:^(
Kireina:	Is that better oh mighty slave of the dictator
Kireina:	There
JelloHammer:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kireina:	<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Kireina:	Hell no
Master9000:	<:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Master9000:	Did you not read the <#305486914910158848>
Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	lol
Kireina:	Though I'm pretty sure its still installed somewhere
JelloHammer:	I didnt realize that it was a euphemism
Kireina:	I haven't touched Blade and Soul in over a year xd
JelloHammer:	When I made my name
JelloHammer:	Fun fact
Kireina:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	kind of like my PBE but more years
Neon Strike Kitty:	My B&S isn't up to date
Kireina:	made of the jellies
Kireina:	with your hammer
Kireina:	Do I need to smack you
JelloHammer:	<:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Kireina:	*sigh*
JelloHammer:	He's given his blade and traded his soul for it
Kireina:	rip
JelloHammer:	Xeon has become blade and soul
Kireina:	He'll see it
Kireina:	So unless he's a poop
Neon Strike Kitty:	congrats!
Neon Strike Kitty:	So you just gave him a random notif
Kireina:	He's had discord for awhile :p
Neon Strike Kitty:	By default, pings don't show up when you're playing a game
Master9000:	<@!128388878947057664> I grant you life and the will to use it
Kireina:	LOL
Kireina:	Well now we wait
Neon Strike Kitty:	He was offline earlier
Kireina:	<@!128388878947057664> Buddy are you alive
Kireina:	Probably but he isn't even at his computer half the time
Neon Strike Kitty:	I think he's awake
Kireina:	*stares at Blade & Soul*
Kireina:	You know I don't think the fact that xeon leaves his computer on 24/7 is good
Master9000:	https://youtu.be/FOKEFoDXVDw
JelloHammer:	JUST DO IT
Master9000:	Dewit
JelloHammer:	ohello
Aqua033:	Today I learned a valuable lesson: If you want a job done, do it yourself.
JelloHammer:	LANCER GA SHINDA
Neon Strike Kitty:	*cries every time*
JelloHammer:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
JelloHammer:	Except for their E rated luck stat
JelloHammer:	Yep
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lancer for best class
JelloHammer:	my bad
JelloHammer:	Yeah, just saw that
Neon Strike Kitty:	He's in Extra CCC as well
Neon Strike Kitty:	Lancer/Launcher?
JelloHammer:	Karna, basically
JelloHammer:	or whatever he's called
JelloHammer:	Blaster
JelloHammer:	I believe its also the only fate series to feature the second strongest servant
JelloHammer:	Reading the premise alone got me super hyped
JelloHammer:	thats also high on my to-watch list
JelloHammer:	Oh yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm more excited for Fate/Apocrypha personally
JelloHammer:	I mean, I suppose with three movies they'll explore the plot a bit better
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yep
JelloHammer:	....Part 1
JelloHammer:	Pretty pumped for Heaven's Feel this year
JelloHammer:	(I love it though)
JelloHammer:	....... HAHAHAHA
JelloHammer:	I'm pretty sure everyone likes Fat/Stay
Neon Strike Kitty:	And I happen to like Fate/Stay
JelloHammer:	But I'm presently listening to "Don't Stay"
JelloHammer:	Also, its ironic that the song "Stay" is pretty popular right now
JelloHammer:	except some of them are just indecipherable
JelloHammer:	Reminds me a bit of some people from Live at the Apollo yeah
Neon Strike Kitty:	Reminds me of a comedian I watched
JelloHammer:	No joke
JelloHammer:	He pronounces 'Brewing' as 'Beavering'
JelloHammer:	Even for an Indian
JelloHammer:	Man, my biology teacher pronounces things so badly lol
JelloHammer:	The night is bright and full of errors
JelloHammer:	Everything happens at night
Neon Strike Kitty:	Changing nicknames is still enabled btw
Neon Strike Kitty:	I stay up late and everything happens while I'm asleep
BreeZaps:	thanks I hope my Dad doesn't make me feel this way again.
BreeZaps:	❤
KingofZeal:	Anywho, I'm gonna wind down for the night.  Hope you feel better Bree.  You can always chase your dreams in the Kingdom of Zeal, whatever they may be.  Good night all!
BreeZaps:	alright
KingofZeal:	Any time I tack some sort of emote onto my message, and/or lol, it usually isn't meant to be taken seriously
BreeZaps:	oh okay
KingofZeal:	Oh, I get it, I had other things on my mind in regards to that statement, thus the 😛
BreeZaps:	Yeah but I sometimes find letting out how I feel before I go to sleep helps a little.
willofd2011:	Lol
KingofZeal:	Experience has taught me that serious conversation at night is usually not the greatest of ideas.  😛
KingofZeal:	THat's understandable
BreeZaps:	And btw I get emotional at night
BreeZaps:	sounds nice
BreeZaps:	Awww okay
KingofZeal:	Also, in regards to my lovely kingdom, I do indeed treat it as a place of peace and harmony, but I generally put the theme of dreams to it more so.  Zeal is a word for passion in pursuit of something, usually it has a negative connotation.  Alas, the Kingdom of Zeal in Chrono Trigger actually does fall, very tragically.  That's why I seek to rebuild the kingdom to make others happy.  😃
BreeZaps:	that's all
BreeZaps:	No I just though he said a random word to be silly
KingofZeal:	I know, I was just saying, Panda wasn't saying anything bad, you just misunderstood him when he said that
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **BreeZaps leveled up!**
BreeZaps:	okay but that is not the topic?
KingofZeal:	Naisu is a weeb thing bree, cause we're all filthy weebs, lol
BreeZaps:	and people can be who they want to be.
BreeZaps:	You know. Eyan said the Kindom of Zeal means peace. I wish I could live in a world where there is nothing but peace and everyone is happy.
Kireina:	I'm bad at putting my thoughts into words
BreeZaps:	it is.
BreeZaps:	Yeah
Kireina:	I was just trying to say like it's good you have someone, you know?
Kireina:	I'm sorry ._. I didn't mean to be insensitive, really :/
BreeZaps:	I am trying to talk about how I'm feeling rn
Kireina:	LOL
BreeZaps:	okay?
BreeZaps:	...
Kireina:	its just nice
Kireina:	oh
BreeZaps:	panda what was that word

SuperGummying:	idk if i wanna try though
Master9000:	more people will get involved and theyll talk while dragonite has to do stuff not just talk all day <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Master9000:	just talk youtube stuff here
SuperGummying:	hes ahead
SuperGummying:	tbh i would try but dragonite would win
Master9000:	yeah thats pretty easy since you have a 50k lead in camelot already and both bots in this server count each message
SuperGummying:	both servers and bots
Master9000:	both servers?
SuperGummying:	i honestly think i can do both and be on top
superheronerd:	Thanks 😎
superheronerd:	Ooh, good to know
Master9000:	dont worry its less messy than the description makes it seem within the actual spreadsheet, deci made sure of that
Master9000:	in case you missed me spamming it earlier heres the link for how it looks again http://bit.ly/Mee6LVL
Kireina:	lol
superheronerd:	I'm still getting used to the levels system
Deci:	you are indeed
Master9000:	oh also im level 10
Dragonite:	the Mets got pilloried again
Dragonite:	speaking of which
Master9000:	thats the opiate of the masses
Dragonite:	ya gotta believe
Master9000:	*laughs because you cant steal something from 80 layers of mental encryption*
Deci:	*gives dragonite position within political system*
Dragonite:	_steals Master's list and passes it off to Deci_
Deci:	*watches anxiously*
Master9000:	*makes a list of things that he knows and deci most likely doesnt*
Deci:	Of course
Master9000:	conditional murder avoided by IF THEN statement :D
Master9000:	thats why im not teaching you everything i know deci
Deci:	Don't Sleep. Never Sleep
Master9000:	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, ***he taught his apprentice everything he knew***, then ***his apprentice killed him in his sleep***. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
Master9000:	deci cant kill me unless im asleep
Dragonite:	it's okay, Deci, i won't tell anyone
Master9000:	according to the bionicle lore
willofd2011:	Lol
Deci:	I mean, I didn't kill the last one
Master9000:	wait
Deci:	well shit, can't kill him
SuperGummying:	master the french empire
Dragonite:	_appoints Master to be the new coroner_
Deci:	Def
Dragonite:	we're screwed
Deci:	*coroner is dead*
Dragonite:	_calls the coroner_
Master9000:	and i have yet to get halfway thru my first history homework assignment
willofd2011:	Oh noes D:
Master9000:	night is falling upon us
Deci:	Chat isn't dead but it's dying
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Deci leveled up!**
Deci:	Sadly, they kinda dropped the ball on F4
Deci:	"So much more critically acclaimed and engaging than the previous one that we hope they don't screw up the sequel"
Aqua033:	Worse than the game before it? /s
superheronerd:	It's on the list of things I should play, but oops.
Deci:	It's the Skyrim of the Fallout series
Aqua033:	I've heard it's really good
Deci:	Fallout New Vegas is one of my all time favs
Aqua033:	I've never been a Fallout fan tbh
Dragonite:	never
Deci:	#FalloutISBetter
Neon Strike Kitty:	I should go to sleep now
Aqua033:	Something about the god awful models were charming for me.
Dragonite:	tee hee
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd like an Oblivion remake with character faces that don't look like they came out of the blender
Aqua033:	Skyrim has always paled in comparison to Oblivion imo, but I still enjoy it.
Neon Strike Kitty:	tbh I don't know if I'll still like it after trying Breath of the Wild
Aqua033:	I'm gonna love it on Switch
Neon Strike Kitty:	probably gonna give it a try on Switch anyways
Neon Strike Kitty:	Skyrim <:PCMR:305892755014418435>
Master9000:	for all your `its better on PC needs`
Master9000:	<:PCMR:305892755014418435>
Master9000:	ok fixed it
Kireina:	idk
Master9000:	is it 128 or less?

Kireina:	?
Master9000:	<@116347313080762372> get the PCMR guy into his own icon
Neon Strike Kitty:	Make what an emote?
Master9000:	i need to make that an emote
Deci:	yeah, they're pretty trash
Neon Strike Kitty:	How does anyone play things with this?
Neon Strike Kitty:	and holy crap, touch screen controls are annoying
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, my brother has Terraria on his tablet, and I tried it out today
Master9000:	and it just faceplanted in trying to do both
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> thats where starboudn fucked up in making their game both a developed and explored galaxy while also trying to make it vast and to be discovered
Deci:	for the most part
Deci:	and even then, those games are really, *really* simple
superheronerd:	Sounds about right
Aqua033:	^
Deci:	it is an interesting *sandbox* but it is not an interesting *game*. Players make interesting games *IN* the sandbox
Master9000:	same
Neon Strike Kitty:	I wouldn't play in it
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd let my cats shit in that sandbox
Deci:	That's what I've been saying
Neon Strike Kitty:	Minecraft's basically a sandbox
Master9000:	*looks at growth*
Dragonite:	you CAN beat Dark Souls in a half hour, but most people elect not to
Dragonite:	most people don't go into their video games with the intent of speed running them, Deci
Master9000:	if from going zero to moon lord its probably half an hour or so
Deci:	Thus why i put my own anecdotal point
Master9000:	the world record for killing moon lord is in miliseconds
Neon Strike Kitty:	Speedruns are technically not representative of the worth of a game
Aqua033:	LMAO this Yasuo
"I was against a Zed, I couldn't win lane"
Deci:	<@137336478291329024> The world record for slaying the dragon is under half an hour. I myself have done it in under an hour. That is not worth 20 bucks.
SuperGummying:	I play that for educational purposes
SuperGummying:	Minecraft
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I'm scared of the Minecraft mobs
Dragonite:	it has SOME direction, it's just not particularly particular about how you go about doing things
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes but that involves killing things
Dragonite:	i mean, if you really wanted to you could go on the quest to slay the ender dragon
Neon Strike Kitty:	and it just told me Deci joined discord
SuperGummying:	What are we talking about?
Neon Strike Kitty:	I connected my league account to my discord so I get friend recommendations
Master9000:	wait what
Deci:	It also means that players must either be *willing to create their own amusement* or waste 20 bucks
Neon Strike Kitty:	Deci, did you get that notif as well?
Neon Strike Kitty:	lmao
superheronerd:	If
Neon Strike Kitty:	wait, that's not how it works?
superheronerd:	Blocks, of you will.
Dragonite:	shush
Deci:	"emergent gameplay" is a way of saying "lack of direction allows the player to create their own."
Neon Strike Kitty:	Minecraft has cubes, so it must be amazing..... right?
Dragonite:	_(っ◕‿   ◕)っvoxels
Deci:	yeah, kitty darkstar joined lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yes
Aqua033:	Cubes!
Neon Strike Kitty:	It has... uhh......
Dragonite:	also something something emergent gameplay and crafting recipes
Dragonite:	minecraft _as a game_ is amazing
Deci:	Minecraft *as a game* is boring. It lacks depth and substance. Minecraft *as a sandbox* is interesting in that it offers potentially unlimited possibility for expansion.
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'd also need to buy the game >.>
Master9000:	if i get another stick of ram for my birthday i could host the server
Neon Strike Kitty:	and by get rid of lag I mean get rid of my brother
Dragonite:	_asphyxiates_
Neon Strike Kitty:	but I'd have to get rid of my lag
Dragonite:	did someone just say minecraft is boring
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've considered that doing a Terraria Hardcore thing with people here could be interesting
Aqua033:	What I always did was just booted up a creative world and just fucked around in it
Deci:	thus, for anyone seeking actual gameplay, it is found lacking. For those interested in doing what they want, building, exploring, whatever, it offers more.
Deci:	the problem with minecraft is that you can get literally the highest tier of equipment without preparation in 30 minutes
Neon Strike Kitty:	Minecraft somehow seems to be over so soon
Master9000:	thats the great thing about terraria/starbound's (albeit shitty) storyline to gradually introduce more stuff
Master9000:	its no fun to have a fully unlocked sandbox
Deci:	it requires a type of person to play it. Either unending creativity or unending, ravenous hoarding
Aqua033:	My login information wouldn't work and I couldn't be bothered to make a new one
Neon Strike Kitty:	and it was boring
Neon Strike Kitty:	and then I got the game
Aqua033:	Nah
Neon Strike Kitty:	I watched so many videos about the damn game and it seemed so fun
Deci:	probably
Deci:	right?
Deci:	then you took a block to the kidney
Aqua033:	It was fun for just relaxing
Aqua033:	I used to play Minecraft
Deci:	Could never get into it
Deci:	^
Neon Strike Kitty:	tbh Minecraft's kind of boring to me
Animal_Glue_:	And it's not resource intensive if you just play minigames
Deci:	not compared to any game that's come out in the last 5 years, though
Animal_Glue_:	its fun tho
Neon Strike Kitty:	Minecraft's pretty damn resource intensive
Master9000:	probably ubuntu or kali
Master9000:	also could be because of Rito not offering the linux community the ability to make a linux server
Master9000:	its errory
superheronerd:	You'd be surprised
Deci:	eh, whatever, i used to have a comp that could run neither, so who am I to judge
Deci:	can't run league? it's less resource intensive than minecraft
superheronerd:	But thanks for the info
superheronerd:	Ah I can't run it anyway, just curious
superheronerd:	I think that's probably the longest I've heard from those I've asked about it recently
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's *really* beginner unfriendly
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's not worth it to get started now, let's say that
Deci:	(I've invested too much time to say it's not worth it)
Deci:	going on my 7th year
Deci:	it is
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's not worth the investment tbh
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've played for maybe 3 years now
superheronerd:	My friends play it too, but I never got around to it
Neon Strike Kitty:	it was hilarious
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've supported a Riven adc as Singed
Deci:	not even joking
Deci:	I have literally received more support pressure from jungle camps than from my teemo
Master9000:	since 2015 Jan 21
willofd2011:	Maybe less idk lol
willofd2011:	Give or take 5 years
Aqua033:	A year, come July.
superheronerd:	How long have you guys played league? Like in general
Aqua033:	You're playing Xayah, right?
Deci:	maybe i'm the one that's too bronze
willofd2011:	Lol XD
Aqua033:	I'm too bronze for that
Deci:	<@136689448225210368> you're talking about so many of the champs in my game I almost thought you were IN my game
Aqua033:	This Warwick is damn fine, though
Aqua033:	Still pretty salty, though.
Aqua033:	No, I don't think that's possible.
Deino Mite:	saltier than deci?
Deci:	#relatable
Aqua033:	Teemo also makes me so
God damn
Salty
Aqua033:	Jesus Christ, this Yasuo
Master9000:	warwick is actually braum
Master9000:	yeah
Deci:	must be pro
Deci:	Yasuo's WarWick can block auto's
Deino Mite:	windwall*
Master9000:	i read that as warwick
Deci:	reliable stun, reliable movement, decent base damages
Deino Mite:	cus his ww can block enemy aa
Deci:	riven
Deino Mite:	yasuo
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> if you had to choose, which would you rather have as your support in all 3 of your promo to diamond games ```
Teemo
Yasuo
Riven
```
willofd2011:	Lol
Deci:	^
Deino Mite:	i prefer teemo not in my game
willofd2011:	Yeah I prefer teemo top the most lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	~~but he's not a politician so it doesn't count~~
Neon Strike Kitty:	Funnily enough I think the guy that got voted President of Iceland is probably completely uncorrupt
Master9000:	the top being for good teemo and the bottom being for teemo support being good
Aqua033:	This Yasuo isn't winning any awards himself
Master9000:	like 0.0000000000000000001/0
Deino Mite:	like politicians that arent corrupt
willofd2011:	I've tried teemo support once or twice did pretty decent despite stealing a good portion of the kills lol
Deino Mite:	it doesnt exist
Deci:	it is beyond comprehension
Neon Strike Kitty:	What would the world be like?
Deci:	I can't
Neon Strike Kitty:	a teemo support that's actually a good support
Neon Strike Kitty:	Imagine
Deci:	rando trash
Deci:	no, like a legit teemo support. This fucker is trash and a legit troll
Master9000:	you mean <@199726036395622400> ?
Deci:	... I have a teemo support right now
Aqua033:	Jesus Christ
Teemo is such an easy lane for Fiora
Neon Strike Kitty:	Now I just have one unused slot
Deino Mite:	i dont want to go to school!
Deino Mite:	i have school tomorrow so i wont get to play xayah all day!
Master9000:	cant argue with that one

Deci:	I have like 38k ip
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, they've got amazing conversations
Deci:	he's not mine, either, but he's interesting nonetheless
Neon Strike Kitty:	Biggest obstacle to learning Rakan is having 5500 IP
Deino Mite:	my favorite part of rakan are his in game conversations with xayah
Aqua033:	Support is really weird for me
Aqua033:	Eh, Rakan isn't really my playstyle tbh
Deci:	not really, but he's an interesting champ to play
Deci:	Rakkan is soooooo cool
Neon Strike Kitty:	I've been trying to learn Rakan
Neon Strike Kitty:	Tech talk
Aqua033:	I should learn Nami.
Deci:	I hardly understand what you're talking about realmaster
Master9000:	which is 4.4/268.375 needed to get the pink
Deino Mite:	now i can try to play xayah again
Deino Mite:	we had an afk so we got to remake

Master9000:	i think mine is 17
Master9000:	is the smurf 30 yet?
Master9000:	they may be smurfing too
Neon Strike Kitty:	it's kind of awkward
Neon Strike Kitty:	mfw I smurf and people try to teach me things in postgame
Aqua033:	God, I missed playing support
Deino Mite:	he even took warlords!
Master9000:	thanks chrome
Master9000:	after seeing him a few games not even on adc
Deino Mite:	and won multiple times
Deino Mite:	i have played it in ranked multiple times
Master9000:	everyone should just know his range is shorter than others
Deino Mite:	so i know how to abuse him
Master9000:	same
Deino Mite:	but i actually have played gnar adc before
Deino Mite:	ya
Master9000:	if he goes mega you either win or lose

Master9000:	step two: learn another champion in a different lane
Deino Mite:	three people in the enemy team have locked in last second and i thought they were gonna dodge
Master9000:	step one: learn one champion
Master9000:	its super easy <@136689448225210368>

Master9000:	i made it to god in two weeks from bronze 3
Aqua033:	Pfft
Deci:	let that be your determination
Deino Mite:	maybe someone will dodge
Deci:	<@136689448225210368> even realmaster made it into gold

Deci:	which will probably be when I have an adc I consider competent
Deino Mite:	deci, you can support me
Kireina:	xd
Deci:	when i get into support again
Kireina:	<@!304445424503226368> When you gonna bring back the orianna support
Deino Mite:	i try to be nice to my supports
Deci:	give a color table to know which is which though
Master9000:	ok
Deci:	yeah
Master9000:	<@!304445424503226368> should the level colors be jsut on the level collumn?
Deci:	:p
Kireina:	We dont need to wonder
Deci:	a new support main? I always need new people to yell at
Deino Mite:	if ya know what i mean
Kireina:	Why do you think
Deino Mite:	i wonder what goes on in there
Aqua033:	That's where I thrived the most
Deino Mite:	why is there a "RoyalBedroom" voice channel?
Kireina:	🤔
Aqua033:	I'm just trying to get back into supporting tbh
Deino Mite:	can finally get back to playing xayah <:Pogchamp:305560024443518986>
Master9000:	im barely started
Deino Mite:	done with my homework
Master9000:	gonna color code the levels by ranks as well
Master9000:	but thats usually in a 1-0 turret lane
Master9000:	im trying to practice freezing but it usually breaks by the 3rd wave
Deci:	so if you can do one but not the other, it's fine until higher elo
Master9000:	same
Deci:	even my wave control is subpar. I win with dueling
Master9000:	wave control?
Aqua033:	My issue is out of turret, surprisingly
Aqua033:	I can turret farm just fine
Master9000:	how well is turret farming going?
Aqua033:	I've been getting more cs, and I've been overall winning lane more
Aqua033:	I *have* been marginally improving in top
Master9000:	you can see my mistakes pretty clearly in retrospect since this was back in 2015
Master9000:	but then it was SUPER buggy with the locked camera
Master9000:	i origionally set up attack moving for kalista actually
Deci:	it's probably why i like jhin so much. Funnily enough, Xayah also greatly benefits from attack moving but I can do that manually pretty well
Master9000:	especially if it was last season and you had ghostblade ms active
Master9000:	you pretty much just alternate clicks if youre chasing someone down with the extra range
Master9000:	twitch with attack move is the fastest way to learn him well
Deino Mite:	have fun
Deci:	lets do this
Deci:	Me as camille vs some rando scrub trashlord as irelia
Aqua033:	I can actually attack move *okay,* but that's because back when I played HotS I mained Valla, and she pretty much required attack moving
Deino Mite:	its still rusty, but its much better than it was when i started
Deci:	I tried to use it, but it screwed me over way too many times
Deino Mite:	i used to hate that, but ive started trying to use attack move
Deci:	which is probably why my caitlyn sucks XD
Deci:	I hate using attack move, I manually input all my commands
Aqua033:	Okay.
Deci:	if farmings an issue, run a page with 15 AD in it to make it easier until you're used to it
Deino Mite:	then it will be easier in teamfights
Aqua033:	I've gotten *better* at it, but it's still not great
Deino Mite:	also, try to use attack move for everything so you get in the hang of using it
Aqua033:	Farming's always been a huge issue for me
Deci:	Deino's got it
Deino Mite:	i main adc
Deino Mite:	if you can learn kiting and farming properly, it can significantly improve adc performance
Deci:	<---- ADC/TOP main. Knows a lot about it. Also Realmaster main's adc, and I think there's a couple more in the Twitch chat (maybe in discord, even) that main adc.
Aqua033:	The main thing is me trying to play ADC when I know jack shit about it and I'm god awful at playing it
Deci:	like, I'm up to play norms with anyone at this point, no matter how good or bad they are, but I dont' duo with even my closest friends unless I know they're up to snuff.
Master9000:	most of my friends list is bronze/silver because im too laz to prune it
Deci:	AKA Stop having fun
Aqua033:	Nah, that's not the issue *entirely*
Deci:	:p
Deci:	Stop duoing with your friends
Deci:	that's pretty bad.
Deci:	XD damn
Aqua033:	35% wr over the last 20 games
Deino Mite:	and then blamed the support
Deci:	#TrashJunglers
Aqua033:	My stats are god awful
Deino Mite:	the gragas missed smite on baron and elder
Deci:	saw that 20 kill game on your history, yeah
Aqua033:	Fair enough.
Deino Mite:	i carried a game really hard as her earlier today
Deci:	Well, yeah, but Fiora/Irelia/Camille are for my main lane, I need to play something if I don't get top
Deino Mite:	thx
Deci:	5/1 in ranked with her deino? nice
Aqua033:	I've put too much time into Fiora to feel comfortable to switch tbh
Deci:	She's up there with Jhin for my ADC role picks now
Deino Mite:	thats how much i like her
Deino Mite:	she's gonna be my new main
Aqua033:	I don't even care if she gets nerfed, she's still gonna be my go to ADC
Master9000:	too much homework
Deino Mite:	id play but i need to draw a dragon for a homework assignment
Master9000:	i wish
Aqua033:	Not right now
Deino Mite:	deci, check out my op.gg and let me know what you think of my xayah stats
Deci:	To hell with it, anyone up to play?
Aqua033:	I just love how she feels
Deino Mite:	ive been playing xayah nonstop and i think im pretty good at her
Aqua033:	Xayah's made me enjoy the hell out of ADC
Deci:	6 minute estimate
Deci:	... queue times are gonna be long as hell.
Deci:	by proxy, yeah
Master9000:	with the armor changes its gonna make darius ult stronger because true damage :D
Master9000:	oh yeah
Deci:	gotta practice my Xayah
Aqua033:	Okay
Deci:	Anyways, I'm heading back into norms, so i'll just be lurking
Aqua033:	Yeah, he's a special sort of dumbass.
Deci:	lel
Deci:	there's no such thing as "enough damage" on an assassin like kha before items.
Aqua033:	I think that was the last time I queued with him.
Aqua033:	He also told me one time to evolve E first on Kha and bring Stormraider's because "Kha already has enough damage"
Deci:	as for stormraiders on trynd... that's just stupid
Deci:	I used to run Undying Grasp on fiora. But that was when it was an On-hit effect and not an actual AD buff
Aqua033:	And Stormraider's on Trynd
Aqua033:	He brought Grasp on *Fiora*
Aqua033:	...Oh Jesus, just looking at his op.gg hurts
Aqua033:	Yeah
Deci:	still that's insane
Aqua033:	I don't think he is anymore
Deci:	wow. That's insane
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Deci leveled up!**
Deci:	there must be SOME troll that's just beign purposefully worse, right?
Zek:	Ez
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Zek leveled up!**
Zek:	Donuts made of biscuit dough
Aqua033:	He was Bronze 5...-180something LP?
Deci:	like cmon
Deci:	How do you do that? I can't imagine it's even possible to be that bad unless its on purpose
Aqua033:	I did that recently with someone
Deci:	He was a racist southern hick that I put up with cuz I'd known him for 7 years. I eventually got sick of him and removedhim from everything
Aqua033:	Fun fact: This person was also the lowest ranked person on OCE at one point
Aqua033:	Ah
Deci:	Nah, his name was Dayton
Deino Mite:	its still gonna be a pain though
Deino Mite:	ya
Aqua033:	Was his name Charlie?
Deci:	but that's because armor/mr values are going up and hp values going down
Deino Mite:	and the upgraded versions are gonna be 35% too
Deino Mite:	going down to 35% pen
Deci:	.... I had a friend, once upon a time, that was that exact same person
Deino Mite:	they are nerfing it which makes me sad
Aqua033:	Also, he can't farm for shit as Irelia.
Aqua033:	Someone who's been carried to silver by his Lulu support, and rage quits every time he loses lane
Deci:	it' so efficient at 45% pen at just 1300 gold as well
Deci:	^
Deino Mite:	i always get lw third item just because of all the ninja tabi everywhere
Deci:	How much worse could you get, Awua?
Deci:	It was so tilting. He's like "Why should I build pen, I'm so fed" and we're all like "NINJA TABI META"
Aqua033:	Eh, least it's not as bad as this one person I queued with
Deino Mite:	^
Deci:	40% winratio on adc in ranked. I wonder why
willofd2011:	How is he even Gold 5
Deino Mite:	https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Rito+Demxi
Deino Mite:	let's look at his stats
Deci:	"Rito Demxi"
Deino Mite:	what is the ezreal's name?
Deci:	not even 30 games played
Deci:	Gold 5
Master9000:	20 gragas support games
Master9000:	let me guess
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm playing on EUNE >.>
Deci:	one moment, let me na.op.gg him
willofd2011:	Ikr lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	I at least know what armor pen is >.>
Aqua033:	Eh, fair enough.
Deci:	I mean, I'm playing camille, so IDGAF what the enemy builds, really, it all dies the same (and they did, I rekt 'em hard) but still.
Aqua033:	I at least buy proper items
Aqua033:	Dear god
That's even more bronze than I am
Master9000:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
willofd2011:	Dang
Deino Mite:	idiot^
Deci:	and then he buys a BLACK CLEAVER on EZREAL
Deci:	and my ezreal with no armor pen items, no black cleaver, no last whisper, nothing, is like "WHY DOES SHE NOT DIE, SHE DOES TOO MUCH DAMAGE, WTF, I"M SO AHEAD"
Deino Mite:	not without at least last whisper and definitely not in a 1v1
Deci:	no adc would ever think they could take it, right? that's like 280 armor on a poppy of all things
Deino Mite:	ill gladly take your position if you want to be banned
Deci:	So, poppy support is 8/9 with 68 cs, right, full armor, tabis, sunfire and randuins
Master9000:	idk you can ban it if u want deci
willofd2011:	Oh dear what happened?
Deci:	wait, why is ass not banned?
Deci:	by this stupid ass adc in my game
Deci:	like legitimately
Deci:	I think i've been triggered

Aqua033:	The current meta is mage/poke supports
Neon Strike Kitty:	or nerfed
Neon Strike Kitty:	I don't want Leo to become pick or ban
Neon Strike Kitty:	Kind of just hoping they don't play my main

Aqua033:	What the hell just happened
Aqua033:	This LCS game
VortexOA:	that sucks
VortexOA:	oh what
Neon Strike Kitty:	that's basically it
Neon Strike Kitty:	Imagine you're playing League and are suddenly locked out of using one of your abilities due to a bug
Neon Strike Kitty:	The Hearthstone bug
VortexOA:	what
Neon Strike Kitty:	And it happened again

Neon Strike Kitty:	Nope
Kireina:	any idea what might be causing it? 😮
Kireina:	Idk much about hearthstone, but thats pretty lame
Kireina:	that sucks
Kireina:	damn
Neon Strike Kitty:	It's happened to me twice, and directly caused me to lose once
Tatsumaki:	🆙  |  **Pandapenguin leveled up!**
Kireina:	That does not seem good
Neon Strike Kitty:	So, Hearthstone seems to have this weird bug where I play a Charge minion but doesn't allow me to interact with it
Kireina:	don't usually actually watch it xd
Kireina:	I just throw it up and listen to it
Master9000:	Have been out of touch with LCS lately between school discord and other stuff
Master9000:	I haven't seen it
Kireina:	watching LCS and twitch be spamming it whenever caster Azael comes up
Kireina:	I just think it's hilarious ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	?
Kireina:	<@!162952008712716288> We need that dank OMGAzael Emote <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kireina:	I just realized
SuperGummying:	I'm the best anivia in the world besides froggen
Aqua033:	Back when my brother played, he mained her
Aqua033:	I've always wanted to play Anivia
SuperGummying:	I heard that
Master9000:	Oh you mean Anivia? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Neon Strike Kitty:	I still managed to 1v1 a Rammus with it
Aqua033:	Sounds like the perfect playstyle for me /s
Neon Strike Kitty:	like they did nothing
Neon Strike Kitty:	Most Sonas would just buy Aura items and sit in teamfights
SuperGummying:	Tsm
Neon Strike Kitty:	It kind of lacked impact
Aqua033:	That sounds
Um
Terrifying
Aqua033:	Oh
ToxicXplosion Gaming:	Hurm?
Neon Strike Kitty:	and the shield wasn't a thing
Neon Strike Kitty:	The auras were permanent
Kireina:	https://www.twitch.tv/nalcs1 Also the "pre-show" as I like to call it is on right now for anyone that wants to watch it
Aqua033:	What was she like pre rework?
Neon Strike Kitty:	twice in PVP but more in bots
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I kind of dropped it when she was reworked
Neon Strike Kitty:	Yeah, but I don't play that much overall
Kireina:	So what I'm hearing is you've only played sona jungle twice :^|
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I won against the enemy jungler both times
Neon Strike Kitty:	I'm not joking, I used to play Sona jungle
Master9000:	I got ducked in a game earlier today by a 500 stacks at 30 mins nasus top
Aqua033:	What
Kireina:	lol
Neon Strike Kitty:	Sona used to be my go-to jungler
Aqua033:	And Sona's always gonna be my support
Neon Strike Kitty:	my lanes are supp, jg and top
Neon Strike Kitty:	tbh if I feel like it I play Heimer but I've kind of dropped mid, so...
Aqua033:	ADC is always gonna be Ashe/Jhin/Xayah
Aqua033:	My picks mid when I get auto filled are Syndra/Ahri
Aqua033:	I've always wanted to try Ori
Kireina:	likely*
Kireina:	Then mid is more then like zed, ori, ahri for me
Aqua033:	If Fiora's banned/taken I just go Poppy and wait for the Fiora W to go down
Kireina:	and then thresh, braum, (probabaly rakan) and bard for supp
Neon Strike Kitty:	and I don't play adc >.>
Kireina:	*whatever adc except draven*
Neon Strike Kitty:	My mid pool is probably just Ahri, though I kind of want to add Talon into that one
Kireina:	Then I just play yasuo malphite shen top
Kireina:	and always will be
Kireina:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kireina:	but realistically it's just lee sin
Kireina:	I would say my jungle pool is more
Neon Strike Kitty:	My top pool is Vlad (pun not intended)
Neon Strike Kitty:	my support pool is Leona. Just Leona.
Neon Strike Kitty:	My jungle pool is Shyv and Diana
Aqua033:	At this point my jungle pool is just Kha and the occasional Vi
Crow_Songs:	<@!162952008712716288>

Kireina:	<:FeelsBadMan:305606725363433473>
Kireina:	FeelsBadMan
Kireina:	little by little
Kireina:	tho my jungle pool seems to be getting cut down
Aqua033:	That's how it tends to be for me
Kireina:	<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Kireina:	The champs i play just happen to be in meta right now
Aqua033:	I'm always gonna be a Fiora main unless she's nigh unplayable
JelloHammer:	I actually watch a fair bit of overwatch competitive and have learned a good bit from watching the pros
Master9000:	Xayah <:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Kireina:	^
Aqua033:	I don't particularly care though
Aqua033:	Oh, I know what's meta
Master9000:	Semi accurately because organized play
Neon Strike Kitty:	Screw the meta, I play support!
Master9000:	Or what's meta
Aqua033:	I just watch it because I like seeing what I can get from them
Master9000:	Oh that reminds me <@212257792722075650> go watch LCS if you can
Kireina:	usually is but its finals so its the oly time i watch it xd
Neon Strike Kitty:	Don't get the appeal in watching some people I don't give a damn about playing a game I might as well just play instead of watch
JelloHammer:	<:Keepo:305611574327115777>
Neon Strike Kitty:	right, sounds boring
Neon Strike Kitty:	Ah, that thing
Aqua033:	It's a League tournament

Master9000:	Her favorite flavor was strawberry
Kireina:	and not gree tea
Kireina:	What was it pistachio

JelloHammer:	Every side is a front?
JelloHammer:	also, a side is technically just a front from another angle

Neon Strike Kitty:	I was tilted when I woke up this morning
JelloHammer:	"We're all tilters now."
Kireina:	:^)
Kireina:	Blah blah I moved to general chat cause tilt
Neon Strike Kitty:	but it's actually something that needs fixing
Neon Strike Kitty:	Right click, mark as read
Lennán:	That message notification for leenesquare isnt going away and its triggering me
Aqua033:	I think the friend I watch anime with has heavy bias towards it because lolis, but it's still pretty good
JelloHammer:	"You disgust me"
JelloHammer:	Yes
Aqua033:	All I'm saying about the new one is
This is the face of judgement.
JelloHammer:	Oreimo ripoff, but not bad
JelloHammer:	It seems nice
JelloHammer:	I need to catch up on that as well
Aqua033:	I'm also watching Eromanga Sensei, but I'm all caught up with that
JelloHammer:	Well, I'll get on that whenever I can
JelloHammer:	I see
Aqua033:	My friends and I all agreed that the second episode is where it really takes off
JelloHammer:	This season seems...less so
JelloHammer:	Last season of anime was amazing
JelloHammer:	yeah, my friend said the same thing
Aqua033:	You'll like the second episode
JelloHammer:	Yet to start on Re:Creators
JelloHammer:	I watched the first episode of akashic records and it was...okay I suppose
Aqua033:	Well, those are the ones I need to catch up on
JelloHammer:	ah yes
Aqua033:	Re:Creators and Akashic Records atm

JelloHammer:	Anime 4 days
Aqua033:	Well, I could, but I'm also *really, really* bad.
Crow_Songs:	i mean you can play League with me

anime, actually doing homework, or just playing League with my friends all day
JelloHammer:	but that one unreadable tag in it is triggering my ocd <:LUL:305559915714576385>
JelloHammer:	I dont mind not being able to view leenesquare
Neon Strike Kitty:	(what really annoys me about it is that no one seems to be online to fix it)
Neon Strike Kitty:	I feel like I should be allowed to see the frickin rules and announcemenets
Neon Strike Kitty:	Like I legit don't have permission to view 3 out of 5 visible channels on this server
Neon Strike Kitty:	>doesn't have permission to view
Neon Strike Kitty:	>gets tagged in Leenesquare

Master9000:	also idk how u want the rules to be set up with them being at the very top of the text channels like we have here, on a pin at the top of guardia, or on a google doc, etc but any of those would work

KingofZeal:	Alright
Master9000:	Ayana is mostly a music bot as well but she has some other fun functions
Master9000:	mee6 is is a bot with these features
KingofZeal:	What are the other 3?
Master9000:	the same one that also records when people joined the server
Master9000:	2nd one
Master9000:	https://mee6.xyz/
https://www.tatsumaki.xyz/
https://ayana.io/
https://baronbot.github.io/
KingofZeal:	I assume that's a bot
Master9000:	its one of tatsu's features
Master9000:	yeah
KingofZeal:	Like, just by showing up?
KingofZeal:	Is there a way to get somebody to auto-join a role?
KingofZeal:	I just want to get everything functional
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I'm not gonna waste time with emotes atm
KingofZeal:	I think I have 2 walkthroughs I want to do before the year is out, ORAS, and CT
Master9000:	oh right u can also set up twitch emotes thru here if u want
KingofZeal:	Yeah, probably
Master9000:	see this is why u need to finish that walkthrough so i can understand this stuff :Keepo:
KingofZeal:	I'm thinking through some stuff
KingofZeal:	It's the kingdom of present day in Chrono Trigger
KingofZeal:	Guardia?
Master9000:	is that a typo or a latin based plural?
Master9000:	we found that part out after an annoying series of experiments
KingofZeal:	Yeah, I already figured that out
Master9000:	btw the order from top to bottom of how you arrange the roles in the menu is the color that will take priority
KingofZeal:	No thanks
Master9000:	btw you should totally get in our gaming voice channel and listen to my musical screeching
KingofZeal:	Lol
Master9000:	i knew that i just somehow didnt expect it to come up
KingofZeal:	Ah, wait, you didn't know the kingdom of zeal was from CT?
Master9000:	you never finished the walkthrough for it and i prefer to binge the whole thing after its uploaded so i am not fully familiar with every aspect of chrono trigger
KingofZeal:	?
Master9000:	I really shouldve expected to see this but somehow i didnt see it right away
Master9000:	ah ok took me a second lol
Master9000:	also hi lightning
Master9000:	and if two roles have identical permissions the one on top will still be superior to the one bellow
KingofZeal:	No, for discord
Master9000:	for stream?
KingofZeal:	Gonna go for a hardcore Chrono Trigger setup
KingofZeal:	I'm fine atm
Master9000:	is it going good or r u focusing on something else rn?
Master9000:	you got the monarch thing visible
Master9000:	was that just now
KingofZeal:	Test
KingofZeal:	Test
Master9000:	and ask dragonite if you want ash here since he owns that one and doesnt have a website set up for it
Master9000:	https://baronbot.github.io/
Master9000:	https://ayana.io/
Master9000:	https://www.tatsumaki.xyz/
Master9000:	https://mee6.xyz/
Master9000:	hmu when youre ready to setup the server, ill link the sites of all the bots we have
Master9000:	btw when youre making roles, hex color 008080 is teal
Master9000:	https://bit.ly/m9k2017
Master9000:	and its nice with links
Master9000:	yeah u can make a lot of channels and sending photos is really easy
Master9000:	got it
KingofZeal:	Test
Master9000:	3HU4nKY
KingofZeal:	Might be wise
KingofZeal:	Yea
KingofZeal:	Probably would consist of the people I have added on skype
Master9000:	if u want to look around our server to see how it runs youre welcome to do so
Master9000:	the main thing you probably want rn is a private stream voice channel so you control who is able to enter it
KingofZeal:	Like who's going where and what not
KingofZeal:	Yeah, see, this is the kind of stuff that I need to mull over a bit
Master9000:	donuts is a mod chat and triforce is the admin chat
Master9000:	heres what we have for our server
KingofZeal:	Not sure what I really want for channels
Master9000:	want me to set up some channels for it rn?
KingofZeal:	I think I'm just gonna look over this later after stream in more detail and then next stream, probably Thursday, I'll go through things with stream
KingofZeal:	You can continue the explanation
Master9000:	you still going thru all the server features or can i also add bots to the explanation?
Master9000:	you can make more admins thru roles for anyone thats really close or needs those powers for whatever reason
Master9000:	you can make as many roles as u want and manage their permissions freely as the owner
Master9000:	neon strike kitty is Ida
Master9000:	big blue is chuck
Master9000:	you can also make more text channels with similar restrictions and if you set them to unreadable to `@everyone`and that will make them invisible to anyone who cant watch them
Master9000:	you, as the owner, can also move people between voice channels freely
Master9000:	then create a new voice channel and select the option to have only those people be able to join the new channel
Master9000:	thats what you can set for all of the people who are close to you who you want to be able to freely join your stream voice channel
Master9000:	ok clicking on the down arrow next to harem of zeal and then going into server settings then roles, create a new one with some managing role
KingofZeal:	here
Master9000:	should i talk on here or on twitch chat for now?
Master9000:	idk how far into it you are but nothing on the server really needs to be hidden
Master9000:	ok
KingofZeal:	No
Master9000:	do u want me to guide u thru it in voice?
