Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	According to the search bar, will's only written about a tenth as many messages as the thing says she has . . .
Dragonite:	That's really weird
Dragonite:	might be the dailies screwing stuff up, or something
Dragonite:	Still doubt that a little but I can't find anything wrong with the code wo I guess I'll go with it
EyanSays:	```Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "lol:"7.65%
Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "XD:" 0.91%
Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "^w^:" 1.80%```
Dragonite:	e!will
Dragonite:	That definitely seems mighty low . . .
EyanSays:	```Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "lol:"2.47%
Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "XD:" 0.14%
Percentage of WillOfD's messages that contain "^w^:" 0.44%```

Dragonite:	that doesn't sound right . . .
Dragonite:	```[WillOfD]
lol=128
xd=24
w=4
messages=12625
```
Dragonite:	hmm
Dragonite:	potential downside being that i can only get messages from the channel that i use "e!all" in
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	that's bizarre
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	it's restarting for no reason . . .
Dragonite:	wat
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Master9000:	Then again you don't need to go 10k deep for those anyway
Dragonite:	ill do that later
Master9000:	I thought you were also fishing for dumb gummy quotes
Master9000:	O rite
Kireina:	lol
Dragonite:	the only ones i'm interested in right now are Will's, anyway
Dragonite:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Master9000:	Idk about time to retrieve but it could save you some data
Master9000:	Delete messages from (list of bot users) in said file?
Dragonite:	idk how to do that, i just say "fetchMessages(a bunch of arguments)" and it does it automatically
Dragonite:	i'm also now expecting to get an angry email from Discord saying "STOP HARASSING OUR DATABASE"
Master9000:	What if u have it ignore all bot messages?
Master9000:	Lmao
Dragonite:	all right, it seems like fetching ALL of the messages in a channel would take an ungodly amount of time, but i can do the last ten thousand pretty reasonably
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	not exactly what i had in mind
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	good
Dragonite:	let's hope i have a backup
Dragonite:	it just overwrote eyan's quotes
Dragonite:	god damn it
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Master9000:	Good point
Dragonite:	it's not like i have anything better to do
Master9000:	That's like a 99% rate we already know this
Dragonite:	(it also doesn't work yet)
Dragonite:	originally intended for will's "lol"s, possibly also useful if you want to comb the old Camelot and seek out instances of gummy stupidity
Dragonite:	it's supposed to dump all of the messages in a channel
Master9000:	What does it do?
Dragonite:	it's not as much fun if you don't have the console window open
Master9000:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Dragonite:	e!all
Master9000:	<:SeemsGood:308321265662427137>
Dragonite:	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dragonite:	Console says the bot is offline but it still works anyway
Dragonite:	That's weird
EyanSays:	TherealMaster9000: if you had to chose a way to die within 5 hours, what would it be? \\ Zeal: By being smothered by boobs
Dragonite:	e!s
Dragonite:	the more i see pimaster arguing with the waifu command, the more i'm convinced it was a good idea

EyanSays:	```EyanSays is a Discord bot for the Kingdom/Harem of Zeal. There's a few things it does.

EyanSays

The bot stores all of the weird things that the King of Zeal says during his Twitch streams. People with kicking boots can add quotes with "e!add <message>".To grab a random quote out of the archive, type "e!says" or "e!s". Use "e!size" to see how many lines are in the database.

If the King of Zeal says something you think is worthy of being added to the archive, ask someone with kicking boots to do it for you (or bother Dragonite#7992 about it).If you're not sure if you have kicking boots or not, you can check with "e!test". (but you probably don't).

Twitch Stuff

EyanSays will monitor the state of Zeal's Twitch stream, and can notify the server when he goes live. If you want to find out if he's live or not, type "e!live" and client.User.username+will inform you.```

Neon Strike Kitty:	Only way it would work would be with a stable loop
Master9000:	lets see how bot says it without the zeroes
Neon Strike Kitty:	time travel is just a really stupid idea
Neon Strike Kitty:	No, Master
Master9000:	because nobody has managed to accomplish it in a significant way
Neon Strike Kitty:	That's not important
SuperGummying:	I don't learn that in school
Neon Strike Kitty:	Time travel is a dumdum
Master9000:	Although Riot had not previously admitted to the mistake, the signs of temporal issues have been evident for some time. The participation in the NALCS of two versions of Cloud 9, including one seemingly flung from the distant past, and the appearance of the entity known only as 'Darth Memeos,' have long raised troubling chronological questions.
SuperGummying:	I don't use anything I learn in school here
SuperGummying:	Why it doesn't help me
SuperGummying:	Well gummy doesn't listen well remember
Neon Strike Kitty:	it would save us a lot of time if you learned in school
Deino Mite:	<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Neon Strike Kitty:	YES
SuperGummying:	Okay you guys really want me to take school seriously
Deino Mite:	has to be
Master9000:	weird this page sometimes randomly crashes
Neon Strike Kitty:	He actually is cheating
Neon Strike Kitty:	and Gummy is apparently ahead of Panda already
Deino Mite:	oh
Master9000:	yeah theres a limit
Deino Mite:	it didnt do the whole thing!
Deino Mite:	The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding
Master9000:	its treason then
Neon Strike Kitty:	Most of the time is not good enough
SuperGummying:	And ida I pay attention most of the time

Neon Strike Kitty:	How the XP system works:
XP is gained every time you talk with a 2 minute cooldown.
XP is not determined by the size of the message. You will not get more XP just because the message is bigger.
XP is randomized from 10-20.
There is global and local XP. Local XP, is XP gained on a server and is represented in the user's server score. Global XP is global and cannot be modified using commands.

Master9000:	<@!141255588846895105> 

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the Spammy"? I thought not. It's not a story the Mods would tell you. It's an Admjn legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Admins, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create spam... He had such a knowledge of the dank side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from getting timed out by moobot. The dark side of the Keyboard is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power supply, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice stole his drivers in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from moobot, but not himself.

Tatsumaki:	🐱  |  **Master9000, did you know?** Cats can get tapeworms from eating fleas. These worms live inside the cat forever, or until they are removed with medication. They reproduce by shedding a link from the end of their long bodies. This link crawls out the cat's anus, and sheds hundreds of eggs. These eggs are injested by flea larvae, and the cycles continues. Humans may get these tapeworms too, but only if they eat infected fleas. Cats with tapeworms should be dewormed by a veterinarian.

Neon Strike Kitty:	I feel like I should be able to read the rules >.>
Aqua033:	Nah, I'm not in vc and I can hear it
