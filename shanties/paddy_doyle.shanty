To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!
To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
We'll all drink brandy and gin!
To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
We'll all shave under the chin!
To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
We'll all throw muck at the cook!
To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
The dirty ol' man's on the poop!
To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
We'll bouse her up and be done!
To me, Way-ay-ay Yah!
We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!
