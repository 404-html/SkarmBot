When he was 'prenticed in London
He came to see his dear
The candles all were burning
The moon shone bright and clear
He knocked upon my window
To ease me out of my pain
I rose to let him in and then I barred the door again
---
I like well your behaviour
And this I often say
I cannot rest contented
When you are far away
The roads they are so muddy
We cannot walk about
So roll me in your arms, love
And blow the candles out
---
My father and my mother
In yonder room do lie
A-hugging one another
So why not you and I?
A-hugging one another
Without a fear or doubt
So roll me in your arms, love
And blow the candles out
---
I prithee speak more softly
Of what we have to do
Lest that our noise of talking
Should make our pleasure rue
The streets they are so nigh, love
The people walk about
They may peep in and spy, love
So blow the candles out
---
I prithee speak more softly

Lest that our noise of talking
Should make our pleasure rue

So blow the candles out
---
And if we prove successful, love
I'll name it after thee
I'll treat it neat and kiss it sweet
And daff it on my knee
When your three years are over
Your time it will be out
And I will pay my debt to you
By blowing the candles out

As I was going to Derby, 
'twas on a market day, 
I met the finest ram, sirs, 
that ever was fed upon hay.
---
That's a lie, that's a lie
That's a lie, a lie, a lie!
---
This ram and I got drunk, sir, 
as drunk as drunk could be, 
And when we sobered up, sir, 
we were far away out on the sea.
---
This wonderful old ram, sir, 
was playful as a kid;
 He swallowed the captain's spyglass 
along with the bo'sun's fid.
---
One morning on the poop, sir, 
afore eight bells was struck. 
He climbed up to the sky's I yard
 an' sat down on the truck.
---
This wonderful ol' ram, sir,
 he tried a silly trick,
 He tried to jump a five-barred
 fence and landed in a rick.
(Chorus)
---
This wonderful ol' ram, sir,
 it grew two horns of brass,
One grew out o' his shoulder blade,
 t'other turned into a mast.
---
An' when this ram was killed, sir, 
the butcher was covered in blood.
Five and twenty butcher boys 
was carried away the flood.
---
An' when this ram was dead, sir,
 they buried it in St.Joan's,
It took ten men an' an 
elephant to carry one of its bones.

Weigh-hay and up she rises
Weigh-hay and up she rises

What will we do with a drunken sailor,
What will we do with a drunken sailor.
What will we do with a drunken sailor,
Earlay in the morning?
---
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Earlay in the morning!
---
Put 'em in the scuppers with a hose pipe on him,
Put 'em in the scuppers with a hose pipe on him,
Put 'em in the scuppers with a hose pipe on him,
Earlay in the morning!
---
Put him in the brig until he's sober,
Put him in the brig until he’s sober,
Put him in the brig until he's sober,
Earlay in the morning!
---
Put him in the bed with the captain’s daughter,
Put him in the bed with the captain’s daughter,
Put him in the bed with the captain’s daughter,
Earlay in the morning!

Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys

Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes
---
Come all you young sailor men, listen to me
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea;
---
Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail
---
Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth
Saying, "You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef!"
---
Up jumps the whale, the largest of all
"If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!"

Storm along boys! Storm along John!
I dug his grave with a silver spade
Ah-ha, come along get along
Stormy along John!
---
I lower'd him down with a golden chain
Storm along boys! Storm along John!
I lower'd him down with a golden chain
Ah-ha, come along get along
Stormy along John!
---
I carried him away to Montego Bay
Storm along boys! Storm along John!
I carried him away to Montego Bay
Ah-ha, come along get along
Stormy along John!

Look ahead, look-astern
Look the weather in the lee!
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
I see a wreck to windward,
And a lofty ship to lee!
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary
---
"O, are you a pirate
Or a man o' war?" cried we.
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
"O no! I'm not a pirate
But a man-o-war," cried he.
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary.
---
We'll back up our topsails
And heave vessel to.
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
For we have got some letters
To be carried home by you.
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary
---
For broadside, for broadside
They fought all on the main;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
Until at last the frigate
Shot the pirate's mast away.
A sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary
---
With cutlass and gun,
O we fought for hours three;
Blow high! Blow low! And so sailed we.
The ship it was their coffin
And their grave it was the sea
A-sailing down along
The coast of High Barbary

A poor old man
Came riding by.
And we say so,
And we know so.
O, a poor old man
Came riding by,
O, poor old man.
---
Says I, "Old man,
Your horse will die."
And we say so,
And we know so.
And if he dies
we'll tan his hide.
O, poor old man.
---
And if he don't,
I'll ride him again.
And we say so,
And we know so.
And I'll ride him
'Til the Lord knows when,
O, poor old man.
---
He's dead as a nail
In the lamp room door,
And we say so,
And we know so.
And he won't come
Worrying us no more
O, poor old man.
---
We'll use the hair of his tail
To sew our sails
And we say so,
And we know so.
And the iron of his shoes
To make deck nails,
O, poor old man.
---
Drop him down
With a long long rope
And we say so,
And we hope so.
Where the sharks have his body
And the devil takes his soul!
O, poor old man.

O say was you ever in Rio Grande?
A-weigh, you Rio!
It's there that the river brings down golden sand,
For we're bound for the Rio Grande
---
And away, boys, away.
A-weigh, you Rio!
It's fare-you-well my bonny young girls
And we're bound for the Rio Grande
It's fare well to you all the girls of the town.
A-weigh, you Rio!
You got our half-pay for to keep you around,
And we're bound for the Rio Grande!
---
She's a deep water ship and a deep water crew.
A-weigh, you Rio!
You can keep to the coast but we're damned if we do,
And we're bound for the Rio Grande!
---
We was sick of the beach when our money was gone.
A-weigh, you Rio!
And sign in this packet to drive her along,
And we're bound for the Rio Grande!
---
Did you ever see a wild goose
Sailing o'er the ocean?

Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh heigh!
They're just like them pretty girls,
When they gets the notion.
---
Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh heigh!
The other morning
I was walking by the river.

Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh heigh!
When I saw a young girl walking
With her topsails all a-quiver.
---
Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh heigh!
I said, "Pretty fair maid
And how are you this morning?"

Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh heigh!
She said none the better 
for the seeing of you

Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh heigh!

The worst old ship that ever did sail,
Sailed out of Harwich on a windy day.
---
And we're waiting for the day,
Waiting for the day,
Waiting for the day
That we get our pay.
---
She was built in Roman time,
Held together with bits of twine
---
Nothing in the galley—nothing in the hold,
But the skipper's turned in with a bag of gold.
---
Off Orford Ness she sprang a leak,
Hear her poor old timbers creak.
---
We pumped our way round scalby Ness,
When the wind backed round to the west-nor'-west.
---
Into the Humber and up the town,
Pump you blighters—pump or drown.

A soldier lad came here last night
With riding he was weary
A soldier lad came here last night
And the moon was shining clearly
---
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
---
She's takes the trooper by the hand
And leads him to her chamber
She's given him some wine to drink
And his love it flared like tinder
---
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
---
They had not been in bed an hour
An hour but scarce a quarter
But the drums coming up the street
And then the beat was shorter
---
Its up, up, up, our colonel cried
It's up, up, up and away, then
It's up, up, up, our colonel cried
The morn's our battle day then
---
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
---
It's when will you come back again
My own dear soldier laddie
When will you come back again
And be your bairnie's daddy
---
Oh, hold your tongue my bonnie wee lass
Never let this parting grieve thee
When heather cows grow oxen bows
Bonnie lassie I'll come see ye
---
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
---

Whiskey is the life of man,
Whiskey, Johnny!
O, whiskey is the life of man,
Whiskey for my Johnny O!
---
O, I drink whiskey when I can
Whiskey, Johnny!
Whiskey from an old tin can,
Whiskey for my Johnny O!
---
Whiskey gave me a broken nose!
Whiskey, Johnny!
Whiskey made me pawn my clothes,
Whiskey for my Johnny O!
---
Whiskey drove me around Cape Horn,
Whiskey, Johnny!
It was many a month when I was gone,
Whiskey for my Johnny O!

I thought I heard the old man say:
Whiskey, Johnny!
I'll treat my crew in a decent way,
Whiskey for my Johnny O!
---
A glass of grog for every man!
Whiskey, Johnny!
And a bottle for the Chantey Man.
Whiskey for my Johnny O!

As we were a-fishing off Happisburgh light
Shooting and hauling and trawling all night
---
In the windy old weather, stormy old weather
When the wind blows we all pull together
---
When up jumped a herring, the Queen of the sea
Says "Now, old skipper, you cannot catch me"
---
We sighted a Thresher-a-slashin' his tail
"Time now Old Skipper to hoist up your sail"
---
And up jumps a Slipsole as strong as a horse
Says now, "Old Skipper, you're miles off course"
---
Then along comes a plaice, who's got spots on his side
Says "Not much longer, these seas you can ride"
---
Then up rears a conger, as long as a mile
"Wind's coming east'ly" he says with a smile
---
I think what that these fishes are sayin' is right
We'll haul up our gear now an' steer for the light
---
We'll heave him up an away we'll go
'Way, me Susiana!
We'll heave him up an away we'll go
We're all bound over the mounten!
---
We'll heave him up from down below
'Way, me Susiana!
This is where the crocks do grow.
We're all bound over the mounten!
---
And if we drown while we are young,
'Way, me Susiana!
It's better to drown than to wait to be hung
We're all bound over the mounten!
---
Oh, growl ye may but go ye must,
'Way, me Susiana!
If ye growl too hard yer head they'll bust
We're all bound over the mounten!
---
Up sox, you cocks, hand her two blocks,
'Way, me Susiana!
An' go below to yer ol' ditty box
We're all bound over the mounten!
---
Oh, rock an shake 'er, one more drag
'Way, me Susiana!
Oh, bend yer duds an' pack yer bag
We're all bound over the mounten!
