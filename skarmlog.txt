okay skarm say something now
the only gold level tool you really need is the pick.

okay skarm say something again
    go into the control center and switch outputs
when we're bored and want to look up funny skarm reactions
    he gets a head-start_pokes skarm with a spatula_
    _noms chaos_
_pokes skarm with another spatula_
    _puts flubs in detention_
I wonder if Skarm is passing its finals
    to my family breakfast is another time to eat and doesnt deserve special foods just for itself
Must be one difficult final for birdbrain school
    test
Chill skarm it's just a bit of terminology
    skarm quote it
okay, skarm. fourth wall humor is starting to get old now
    England doesn't have a kidney bank, but it does have a Liverpool.
wondering when someone else will encounter the skarm command's effect
    well the "ryzen 1600" is specifically the cpu of said computer.
Get Flubs some allergy meds, Skarm
    tl;dr nothing should exist and java sucks
I don't think skarm is listening
    enchanted with soul stealing whatsitcalled
sadly, skarm is still alive
    back in albany he was teaching dance for 50-60 hours per week
Yeah, I think either Master may have botched or something glitched with skarm
    It should've been Gummy.
Gummy tried to trigger the message with <:HelloThere:305560404715896832> and skarm didn't pop up with a message
    e!google dovahzul translator
so skarm doesn't mention gummy when he uses hello there
    darn
skarm is very misunderstood
    hoover is a pretty funny name
_sends skarm after bella_
    *is poptat a pasta*
And Skarm is being weird again
    i actually just had the biggest self debate for ice cream
*throws Skarm out the window for reminding me of that*
    _force chokes squid again_
How is Skarm choking me good?
    sprinklers and scarecrows
I’m used to Skarm being violent
    hg/ss is so expensive. a new copy is $799
*switches places with Skarm*
    *doesn’t flail around*
*throws Skarm with a math book at Majestic*
    *bassoons gummy into a windchime*
skarm has his own grammar rules apparently
    don't break my own chat rules? i know right?
skarm is always watching and finding decent to stupid quotes to record. That's basically how it goes
    no keep watching my dude
Because Skarm dropped green paint there
    i can’t even say one of the cheeses i like because it’s spanish <:lul:305559915714576385>
*slaps skarm* YOU IDIOT
    details, details
i have a new idea for skarm
    if it's what you prefer, then i'll start using it.
to make skarm play skyrim?
    lol
<@!162952008712716288> what are you doing to skarm
    also you gotta love that olympic theme
this will reduce the memes per line coming out of skarm
    a bit of both?
So, what did you do to Skarm?
    just reaffirming
senate was not mentioned yet, skarm
    this doesn't help me! this situation sucks
*throws science at skarm*
    _pokes .jar files with a stick and hears a loud explosion from under his desk_
skarm how many times to i have to tell you it's `jar -xf file` not `jar -fuckyou file`
    the battle is starting soon
Go back to bed Skarm
    yeah i was trying to make it not sound lewd
*gives the broken rock to Skarm*
    *sets under the floor on fire*
Something tells me he doesn't want to be a teacher after what I put him through with skarm
    no, you can't
And I'm using a Skarmory
    oh crap my twitter likes has been crazy recently
Anyways time to catch a female Skarmory since I can't be assed to SR for the right fossil
    what rhymes with orange?
and Skarm, good attempt at contributing to the convo
    brb adding steam group to bot logs
*throws Skarm at Draco*
    *noms cake*
*catches Skarm and sets it down gently*
    _goes back to lurking around _
What do you have to say about this, birdbrain?
    kappa
*throws Skarm at Flubs to help make his job interesting*
    _pokes squid with gummy_
i love how i keep getting pings from skarm every time you lot say "dragon"
    the formula was n² + n - 1
*throws Skarm at technology failures*
    *puts rc’s door back before he finds out and hits me with it*
um, skarm why did you take my door?
    this isn't share your sidebar day
damn skarm didnt learn that
    i am a gf of one, sadly
Dragonite, are you actually trying to find more ways for skarm to murder squid
    what is it currently where you live?
I'm not telling you anything, birdbrain
    i feel very isolated right now
yeah, that one asshole who skarm keeps killing
    everyone sucked
Or I can just blame Skarm and move on
    is because disney owns them
*makes Skarm rip Dragonite’s hair out because he thinks it’s fun*
    *blows up squid*
*makes Skarm do something loud*
    *should*
okay, whatever that should from skarm means, probably something not great
    that's a neat site
Maybe if you guys started giving skarm the benefit of the doubt you could start to wean him off of his violent tendencies
    it will lower the army's morale
*throws Skarm at shaco*
    *pokes gummy back*
yeah, you're supposed to poke or blow up squid, skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    because sometimes you just want to kill without worrying about who doesnt respawn
I also think Skarm doesn’t want to kill me for real because he gets too much enjoyment out of this
    but still, i only really enjoyed one class
*throws Skarm at Flubs*
    **gives ida & squid some deodorant**
Can’t you be helpful Skarm?
    at least it kept recording
skarm is being helpful to flubs to an extent
    i'm aware of this
now I'm wondering if that message has been recorded by skarm
    Gummy's loafing around, to nobody's surprise.
*throws bloody shirt at Skarm*
    _pokes ida with caffiene_
No, that was the stuff Skarm gave to me. I’m just waiting to see it explode
    that was a bad shot and I should feel bad
and now skarm is attempting to snipe you for throwing his deodorant
    i gotta go hit a pillow rn
can i have a large 42oz steak skarm?
    iconoclasts.
Or in this case, skarm is calling his guerilla group of warriors to fight against your right to have steak. He's probably an adamant vegan
    tics people off is all i can agree with in that name
just like skarm when he tried to steal my cinnamon roll
    slow clap
*makes Skarm come up with 10 examples*
    _injects caffeine into squid's nose_
_blames skarm for this_
    _just realized he had a program running in bluej the whole time_
*bonks skarm on the head for betrayal of his creator*
    _hasn't had a watch since middle school_
*throws Skarm at Rainy to get my money back*
    _yells at squid_
*throws squids at Skarm*
    *makes a time machine*
*opens Skarm and finds a self destruct mechanism*  I think you're right, Squid.
    its a good thing i dont get messages from blocked people <:kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws my blocked messages at Skarm*
    *throws a fish at the shorts*
*puts 1,000,000 of Skarm’s money on KappaPride for me*
    *throws a fish at the point*
Thanks for the $1 million Skarm
    germany like always kills all the city-states
*puts skarm in his place instead*
    _slaps squid _
Go to work Skarm
    yeah i'm gonna pay you... bitch
I feel like that skarm is going to pay you in monopoly dollars
    eew social
I don't want to hear it from you skarm, back to work
    i take it youre trying to draw a circle
If that doesn’t work, throw Skarm at it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    ok i got panda set up
Hey skarm I need your help with something
    i wouldn't know
thanks for nothing skarm
    you pinged us
*gets restraining order on skarm*
    _goes to ida's gym and messes up the battle field_
of course skarm commits vandalism
    i don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
Harassing Skarm has become tradition here <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
    octothorpe.
For a minute, I thought skarm was just throwing another insult at squid
    if you're going to show me bull videos gummy, then no
That’s just one of my many corpses from the times Skarm ~~and RC~~ have killed me
    get the traitor
*taxes Skarm every time he kills me*
    *slaps the game with a fish*
now im glad i didnt have skarm sien all of these notifcations back out
    i mean if i were to remove that i would only retain my magic wand
Why does Skarm have a magic wand?
    i feel like i should know who chaos3000 is but i don't
dear squid, skarm is about 25% done big brothering you
    theyre worth nothing on their own but so much when put into a fucking barrel
master is making skarm do deep learning on your messages so we can have an ai that behaves exactly like you without needing the real thing
    previous mistakes were repeated
skarm has to ping discord servers about 5000 times
    i assume tom is the one playing monster rancher?
*makes Skarm do something loud*
    _screeches_
Why does Skarm get mad at me?
    i hate
I feel like that reason for skarm getting mad at you would be pretty obvious
    i don't remember the last time i played league
No, skarm's just being random
    lets do the math here, right?
Do something interesting Skarm. I’m bored
    i saw that they received a massive rework on the wiki.
*punishes Skarm for being uninteresting*
    *frames gummy for the crime*
Tfw Skarm framed Gummy for something that Squid did to him
    gamestop drago
I mean big skarm is watching
    ok, i think that's getting me. what do you mean exactly? sorry if this is frustrating you, btw.
guess which one of those lines skarm decided to learn
    stop attatching fireballs to me, dammit! trying to build here
sooner or later skarm will spit that right back out at you
    he also thought that pi should have been twice what it is today
Why would Skarm spit at me? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    cause have you ever heard of missile thrusters?
*throws a banana at skarm*
    _bans drago_
*catches footballs and hands them to skarm* take these will ya?
    nah my bad
*throws a bowiling ball at skarm*
    _watches gummy level up again_
skarm can attest to that
    awful disney movie
@everyone stream started and skarm is slacking off
    Or we could just shoot at it!
You aren't live until skarm says you are <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    no squid
*throws Skarm at Gummy for yelling*
    _dodgerolls_
_pokes skarm with a king_
    *switches places with flubs*
now the question is do i feel like doing source control for skarm today like i said i would last night
    is the sea always salty because the land never waves back?
and now skarm decides to start asking philosophical questions
    (yes it worked)
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    _suddenly is very hungry_
_pokes skarm with a many word thing_
    _throws gum balls at drago_
something tells me that's not going to change from skarm anytime soon
    thats not even an answer choice, squid, lol
Neither will I because I keep sayin Skarm at the beginning of a sentence
    i'm not going to call you that just to prove you wrong
skarm having his name lower cased at the start of messages probably will trigger him to pop up
    tl;dr depressions a bitch
yeah, I was right, I guess skarm being capitalized at the start just doesn't work
    right master
skarm has cooldowns that you guys probably overlooked
    but yeah high school graduation, than a graduation party with a lot of drinking..🙄
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    _reels dragonite back in with more spaghetti code_
*makes Skarm do Dragonite’s homework*
    _pokes the ninny in the throat_
_chucks rc out the skarm_
    *you have me squid*
im tempted to add a thing where skarm picks up usernames as key words and restricts his replies to that but on the other hand thats way too much effort for how much other stuff i should be doing rn
    maybe if you disable bluetooth on your laptop, it with automatically reconnect.
how bad an idea do you think it would be to rewrite skarm completely from scratch when the aws thing runs out?
    that was orgasmic to watch. and i was there
ok so the obvious choice then is to rebuild skarm in html
    you're why i'm racist in this game
bella want to help with skarm 2.0?
    i was planning to do math homework today, i was just too tired xp
skarm, what should i do
    i'm probably going to need new earbuds come to think of it, they're condition is just not going so well
Those were explosive cookies Skarm gave to me
    he an kick people?
*throws Skarm at Gummy*
    _throws cheese at majestic_
did skarm actually record that line
    bella dont worry stardew wont be as good as you think it is right now after a bit
*throws an essay at Skarm*
    _goes and sits in the corner_
_pokes skarm with a spoon to see what happens_
    _noms <:redditsilver:383343161356976128>_
*pokes skarm with a fork because he nommed reddit silver*
    *pokes gummy back*
skarm say some stupid shit
    got my itunes working
That’s not stupid enough Skarm
    speaking of which i should probably go back to being a normal guru
*makes Skarm help dig the hole*
    _hair flip ends up slapping flubs _
_pokes skarm with a frying pan_
    _calculates that to be 4 pings per 53 seconds and remains confused _
I volunteer Skarm to be a gladiator
    look at my ranks
Hey Flubs, you want to fight Skarm?
    i’m now at an outlet mall that’s 90% clothes stores, 5% food and other stores, and 5% closed stores
skarm  go some where better
    i never answer 900 numbers
*throws Skarm to somewhere better to fight*
    _casts magic on gummy_
is it just me or has skarm not been counternomming as much recently
    funny how a jerk friend tried to convince i really was a lady and that my brain was telling me i wasn’t
Why was someone trying to convince Skarm that he was a lady?
    brb gonna scare the shit out of sarah
okay, I was thinking the skarm nomming this user message would pop up until that happened
    although i broke that trend.
Hmm, I don’t think Skarm likes nomming people anymore
    unless it's custard or froyo
*gives Gummy Skarm to bite*
    _sets fire to scratch_
*swaps places with skarm*
    _falls back onto bed_
I'll punch you right outside the window, squid. Or I could let skarm do it because he probably has that message in his log
    or just ignore reports unless the person gets them constantly or all 4 do it to hi assuming theyre not a premade
Always punch skarm, he's a good punching bag, *punches skarm* see?
    eyan, you're not sirchez. shaddap
the system may have gotten confused from the apostrophe after the last letter in skarm as well as there being no space between that and the mark.
    skyrim belongs to the fucking nords
*YELLS AT SKARM TO GET A LIFE*
    *constricts brads movement with an accordion*
And as such, Skarm has decided to wrap you in an accordion
    You remind me of the Penguins. You are broken and battered and you somehow walk away with two wins instead of one.
*makes Skarm go to Flubs*
    _looks at his pfp_
I'M HERE TO EAT DONUTS AND KICK SKARM INTO BUILDINGS!!! AND I'M ALL OUT OF TATER TOTS
    something about blue light
*launches Skarm into space to do that to him*
    *sends dragonite a paper with the word help on it*
I think skarm wants you to help him against squid
    belethor just casually accepts it lol
almost just got myself censored by skarm lol
    was this in  bronze 16?
*throws skarm into the -23(76)squared chair
    godammit deci, god, terrible, horrible, what are you doing man?
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    *throws squid off a cliff*
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
    _force chokes squid again_
skarm has a new anti-idiot feature
    *<:kreygasm:327309186515992577>ic sounds* so fabulous
*throws the country at Skarm* okay let's start over with a fresh slate
    thats that to none
hey skarm, want to ponder the meaning of life?
    Screw walls! They were overrated anyways.
idk i like skarm's meaning
    what dance video?
*pulls out a box top sword* YOU WANNA GO??? *slices skarms head off* YAAARRRR
    go to sleep now, then..... or go to school, maybe?
I always wanted to play along with eyan's heart gold lp but he had a skarmory so early in the game that it was hard to do
    why is he reading the back of a happy meal?
Did he like gen that skarmory
    as of course you can imagine, they used everything on me
_feeds gummy to skarm_
    _flushes master down the toilet_
*uses flamethrower on skarm*
    _chew on squid_
and then you programed skarm to make sure they werent worried about ai takeovers
    youre a liar
If Eyan doesn't like Pokémon anymore than why is there a skarmory bot
    <:LUL:305559915714576385> 
and he still likes Skarmory
    *<:kreygasm:327309186515992577>ic sounds* so fabulous
and none of the emotes skarm just used are here, i tapped those in thru a different server
    blankets are great because theyre like socks but easy to put on
*throws skarm at flubs*
    _pokes pokes_
Hey skarm may i have some fruit roll ups  please?
    and you havent lived until youve been hiking up a mountain for an hour or two  and then trip and break your leg
suck a duck skarm
    unless it's custard or froyo
skarm what do you think about this
    annoyingness
well you're no fun at all, skarm

_feeds rc to skarm_

    *breaks winter*
*throws Skarm at RC and runs to bed*
    *throws genwunners out the window*
I don't want this
*throws skarm at squid*
    There are 10 types of people in the world - those who understand tertiary, those who don't, and those who thought this was a binary joke.
No, I'm giving Flubs ideas, and to a lesser extent, skarm
    ahem
Stay out of this birdbrain
    nooooo ida
*throws Skarm out the window for calling me Ida*
    _watches fish secure the point_
Say something interesting Skarm
    just use a bigger bomb and then they don't have families
well that is certainly interesting, skarm...
    cosmic chicken
is this true Skarm
    i made a rounding error, which is weird because how i've been rounding is the same way i'[ve been rounding the entire year and it's never done me bad until now
guys skarm has rgb lightsabers now
    rarity pkushie made in the uk
*breaks Skarm again for no reason*
    _blows up_
*throws Skarm at the flailing*
    _banishes gummy to the land of whatever the other discord hes in is called_
Dragonite, Skarm is supposed to be the pun teller <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

*throws Skarm off the ship*
    _pokes flubs with subscription emails and the sort by date heading_
I think Skarm took it. He really wants the robots to take over
    empty weekends
*throws Skarm back to lastvillage*
    _now wants to change gummys name to anything but rarity_
*slaps skarm* darn it
    also happy valentines day and happy singles awareness day! :seoxyslove:
think you broke skarm more
    i thought it would fall to deci since youre not married yet
skarm being more broken? In what world?
    After periodic doubts about his vocational calling, the young chemistry teacher concluded he was out of his element.
He’s telling puns again. Skarm is fine
    that isn't me
*throws Skarm out the window*
    *slaps the game with a fish*
yeah that wasn't skarm at all, ,that was his shadow
    that changes nothing
*makes Skarm less boring*
    *blows up squid's house*
I'm glad you actually thought ahead for skarm to blow up houses
    old timey pistol also seems balanced tho, bc you take a lot of time to load it and it isnt accurate, but still a gun
*switches places with Skarm*
    *y’all need jesus*
by that logic you were impaled and then swapped with skarm
    i only found one shield in the dungeon by the way.
i mean i could look through skarm's log and extrapolate from there but that sounds like a lot of work
    https://clips.twitch.tv/SourBlatantCrowKippa
_points at skarm and watches skarm go zipping into his finger_
    _pokes ida with a stick_
Why did Ida have to get poked Skarm?
    man i love empire total war
skarm stop hanging out with gummy
    just use a bigger bomb and then they don't have families
That is a solution, how good of one on the other hand, ask skarm
    greetings, bella.
And also Skarm has no vpice
    master have you looked at libgdx yet
*waits for Skarm to step in*
    *opens underground dnd ring in the gym after hours*
Ok, it looks like Skarm doesn’t feel like killing me today
    is it a tool that penetrates and measures penetration?
*switches places with Skarm before that happens*
    _collets some samples_
*throws a fish at Skarm because I’m bored*
    *noms door*
One day i will have a Birdbrain for dinner

_does a diff on skarm's code_
    *sigh*
*throws Skarm at the Mets*
    _whacks squid on the head with it_
skarm are you a robot
    maybe the game hates me
DONT YOU CARE ABOUT SKARM’S FEELINGS?! BECAUSE I CANT
    what is even going on
26550 from draco
8238 from skarm
    i feel like this is gonna activate something but its ok, its just gummy
So Skarm is a communist I guess
    i already played a bit of that
why is skarm red galoer now
    I feel like Ralts would be a real cool Pokémon to have because you could just squish it.
*throws Skarm out the window*
    *strikes ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) through something*
*throws Skarm at Gummy to torment him*
    _changes squid's channel back to math_
whoever said skarm was only allowed to torment gummy?
    are you texting and driving, first of all
while im in skarm, anyone want me to add anything to him?
    i resent that statement. off with your head
I guess skarm didn't appreciate such action
    be peaceful
Hey Skarm, make our jobs not suck
    code instead
what, making skarm do it instead?
    i was hoping for a better troll response
skarm doesn't learn mentions
    take him to symphonic evolutions
*throws Skarm and runs*
    _yells at squid_
*throws Skarm out the window because he didn’t call me Squid*
    _rolls away from this mine field of a conversation_
None. Skarm is paying the taxes
    anyways where was i?
Yeah, Skarm's busy doing his taxes right now. Don't disturb him, he just lost his place.
    greetings, squid.
_throws skarm at squid_
    _wallops squid with storm breaker_
Oh skarm can't manage messages in blackomen LUL
    there goes my wallet
<@137336478291329024> want skarm to have mike or some variation added to your trigger list :Keepo
    why they did it like that i have no idea
shut up, stupid birdbrain bot
    why would we stop this beautiful thing
looking into that now because skarm's announcement code is the spaghettiest of the spaghetti
    flubs is hiding nothing
ehh, i'm procrastinating other things today, i might as well see if i can fix skarm
    i feel like i should know who chaos3000 is but i don't
huh, last time skarm even checked to see if zeal was live was may 5
    honestly it mightve been in utah. ive been to utahs capital and one other town north of that i cant remember the name of
am shocked that I just found out Skarm/Zeal has a Discord.
    there's mods for everything, the question is, are there _good_ mods for everything
oi skarm, ,murder this squid
    is a pint of ice cream a lot?
because skarm fucking hates your guts, obviously
    they apparently don’t want kids to worried about finals and grad so they do grad first
but do your other servers have Skarm
    or given my personal rating
I needed this server to fill that whole in my heart that missed Skarm.
    flub flub
Garbage Day? *throws Skarm out*
    bop ***explosion***
I didn’t know Skarm was a bomb
    does adobe have a disable feature function?
what do you think about this, skarmm
    ohhhhhhhhhhh
Did the realization kick in for skarm?
    isnt that just calculus
so should mee6 fear for their life at this point? skarm is taking all their jobs
    i would go
but yeah since mee6 is in charge of twitch announcements, skarm gets join announcements
    im just excited to read napoleon in america
so no other servers would have skarm? come on, drago
    what you do now
~~And is that either Skarm or Flubs?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
    i think its like wolv-ee

    this is shaping up to be a good story, i don’t feel powerful
I never introduced myself, just said, "I used to watch Skarm/Zeal/Eyan and was yearning for his stuff for YEARS. Now I'm here."

And then that's it.

We don’t need Skarm singing. He’s probably bad at it
    so that we can bitch about the french
skarm i think it's high time you start making sense

skarm will start making sense when you program him to make sense
