To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit.
To return to its past glory, it must reacquaint itself with the hatred of this world.
Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master.
Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the song of your grandeur.
The blade will feed on the ire of Tamriel. Bathe in your infamy. Feel the weight of their loathing, and my power will course through it once more.
Excellent work, child.
I can feel their heartbreak swelling in my blade.
Their tears shine the ebony to a sharpest gleam.
Ah, the blood of deceit is a nourishing flow.
At last, my blade is returned to its full glory.
Now go forth, child. Continue your tiny subversions against the orders of trust and intimacy.
The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes.
You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable.
I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore.
I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers.
I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal.
You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences.
And those winds issue from my whispers.
Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them.
Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.
That one right there, walking out the door. He was one of them asking about that old man you're looking for.
You know, since Kodlak's funeral the Skyforge feels more... awake.
It's always been said that the souls of the heroes of old are what give Skyforge steel its strength.
But I think the forge knows the greatness of Kodlak's soul. I can't really explain, but it feels like it's... young.
I'll wager it could now forge metal the likes of which hasn't been seen since eras long forgotten.
I'm eager to try.
Let's go!

This way, friend! Move!

I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job.
Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later.

It's true about the dragons returning. Saw it with my own eyes.
Thank you for your kindness.
Thank you for the gold, traveler.
That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by.
No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.
I'd stay away if I were you.
I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering.

It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.
I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.
The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock.
Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock.
Thanks. You take care of yourself, now.

Ah, a student of the craft. You'll need to start by learning an enchantment.
Take an enchanted weapon or piece of armor, then use the Arcane Enchanter to learn its secrets. The item is destroyed in the process, so be wary.
Once you know an enchantment, you'll need a filled soul gem, and something to enchant. You'll use the Arcane Enchanter for that, too.
Of course, I have everything you need for sale, if you have the coin.
Long as you clean up. You know how to use it right? Mix a couple of ingredients together, see what happens.
A little Wheat and Blisterwort makes a healing potion, if you didn't know.
We have plenty of ingredients for sale, too.
Yes, actually. How about you smith me an iron dagger? Here's everything you need to make one. Go ahead.
Not bad, but it's a little dull. How about you sharpen it up? Just need a bit of metal and the grindstone over there.
This looks good. You put time into your blades, they'll serve you well when you need them.
You want to keep helping? How about you make some armor? Let's start by tanning some leather on the rack.
Ah, good. A lot of weapons and armor need leather for straps, fittings, that kind of thing.
Let's see if you can make a hide helmet. Here's the rest of what you need.
I should hire you to be my assistant at this rate.
Let's improve the fit. Take this leather to the workbench over there.
You have talent. Keep working at your craft, and you'll be a fine smith one day.
Why don't you keep that dagger and helmet? Maybe you'll remember me when you're making Skyforge Steel, huh?
Or if you're feeling lucky, you can take this bow. Might take her by surprise.

Let's see here....
Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind...
It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else.
He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before.
But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.
Do you remember what I first told you, about how not being able to control magic could destroy you?
I didn't simply mean it could kill you. The Augur's accident is another very real type of a life destroyed.
Well, it's been described as an accident. I can't imagine it was intentional.
Something must've gone wrong, and he ended up in the state he's in now, fused to the energies that flow through the College.
I've never felt it appropriate to ask him about it, about how that must feel. Or, I suppose, if he can feel at all.
We lost everything.
There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned.
It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed.
Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky.
You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.

He holed himself up in Labyrinthian, and devoted all of his time to research and study. Wrote more than you would imagine possible.
Since then, his writings have been scattered all over Skyrim, but are little use to anyone who can't translate them. I'm one of the few who can.
I'm always trying to find more of Shalidor's writings.

I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned.
Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?
with great relief
You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons.
Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill.
Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages?
Or will your name be a curse to future generations?
Or will you merely fade from history, unremembered?
Let the Way of the Voice be your guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus, Dragonborn. Your future lies before you.
Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind.
He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater.
But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.
We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon!
Please... Delphine has been very worried about you.
Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?
We are all in your debt, Dragonborn.

I'm afraid she's right. I'm deeply sorry that this has to come between us.
But just as Paarthurnax's later deeds do not expiate his crimes, your deeds do not allow us to ignore our duty.

But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.

Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak.
But with four Voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle.
To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted.
Through fire and time, the terror has lived. No more, I say! I've set my heart on terrible deeds, death's grim art.
Now ends this tale, my eternity be damned!
If it is our lot to end, we'll live in song if not in soul.
At Sovngarde's gates I'll meet my fate with mirthful heart, and know I fell in noblest cause.

You know, things are really starting to move around here. I mean, look at the place. I've never seen so much merchandise.
Yeah, it's really something else, isn't it?
At this rate, the Guild won't be such a laughingstock anymore.
I agree. It'll be nice to get back the respect we lost in the last few years.
Take a look around. Have you ever laid eyes on such wealth?
Never. This is the best the Guild's done since I've been a part of it.
How's the training going?
Better than ever. With the Guild back on its feet, there's more coin to throw around. How about you?
Couldn't be busier.
Let's just hope it stays this way for a long time.
So I'm finally seeing you with a smile on your face.
It's this place. It feels like home. It's just nice to finally have something going right in my life.
No? Well, if you think you're capable of it, then I'd be happy to provide it to you for a mere 30 gold.
Or you can try your luck with one of the court wizards around Skyrim. They also sell spells.
Here you are. Now I'm anxious to see you cast it.
Die, you dog!
Death to the beastblood!
I'll rip you apart, Companion!
Ysgramor would be ashamed of you!
I can smell your shame!
Which one is that?
We knew you'd be coming here.
Well, look what we have here.
It's time to die, dog.
Your mistake, Companion.
It doesn't matter. She wears that armor, she dies.
It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies.
Killing you will make for an excellent story.
None of you will be alive to tell it.
You're going to regret this.
trying to figure out how to explain the strangeness of Markarth to a foreigner
The Reach has been part of Skyrim for a thousand years, but the Reachmen still haven't accepted it.
It was only 20 years back that the Reachmen rebelled. Even took control of Markarth itself for a time.
They were crushed, of course, but the survivors - the Forsworn - still lurk in the wilds and make the Reach dangerous for honest folk.
Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're looking for?
By the nine!

Have it your way. Let's get that crown men!
Alright, get the crown off that draugr!
Ralof... get away from there, fool!

Ah well, it was a long shot.
Oh that's very sweet of you. Anything you can find out from Captain Aldis would be welcome news.
Ah, well I guess it was unlikely. I'm sorry to waste your time.
You're a traveller, correct? Have you been to Whiterun?
Wonderful. I hadn't really hoped to run in to someone who had been there.
My daughter, Fura, was assigned to Whiterun after she joined the Imperial Army.  I was hoping you might have met her.
I haven't heard from her lately. I've tried talking to Captain Aldis but he hasn't been any help.
Sure - take advantage of the guy in jail. Okay, fine. I can make the deal sweeter.
emphasize [QUOTE]here[QUOTE] - like, duh, I'm in jai
Take it.
Nice try, but my mother's already got me in jail. Maybe you should try that one on Letrush.
You're playing a dangerous game, my friend.
Fine, you win. Take the horse and leave.
And telling her what? That you stole her horse? I don't think so.
Now wait a minute... No need to do anything drastic. Look, Keep the horse, all right? Then we all walk away happy...
Well ain't that the truth of it. All right, then. Let's see what you've got!

Done, then? This way!

Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment.

I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves.
The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed.
If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought.
Take a good look around you! Have you ever see the Guild in such a prosperous state?
With Mercer Frey gone and our influence present in all of Skyrim's cities, the Guild's accumulating wealth faster than we can spend it.
laugh at the end - you're being coy (you are referring to the Player who is now the Guild Master)
With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades.
It's as if the merchandise and coin are simply falling from the sky.
Vex and Delvin are having to turn clients away at this point, it's almost impossible to keep up.
Don't forget to check your tribute chest once in a while. As Guild Master you're getting a significant cut of the spoils.
This next song goes out to the Dragonborn. The savior of Skyrim.

This is an ode to Skyrim's staunch protectors... the Imperials.
This one's a favorite of mine. A legend we all know and love...
This is a local favorite and one of the first songs I ever learned. Ragnar the Red.
I admit, I doubted you, but no more. You've made a dragon submit to your will. A feat to rival the legendary Olaf One-Eye! What glory!
Carry on, soldier. This is all part of the Dragonborn's plan.
May Kynareth guard you while you pass through her realm!

Fear not, my honor holds my rage at bay.
in disbelief but also admiration, watching the player climb onto a dragon's back
Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.
Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity!
I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge.
I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself.
Surely you wouldn't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...

Just one. I know when I was found by my Argonian father, I was wrapped in a blanket bearing the symbol of House Telvanni.
It was one of the great houses in Morrowind long ago. Whether that means I was one of them or not, I'm uncertain.
If you come across anything in your travels that might provide me with the answers I'm looking for, I'd be grateful.
Thank you.
I learned that a matron who had served for House Telvanni had escaped Morrowind during the Accession War.
Records showed her buying passage aboard a sailing vessel named [QUOTE]The Pride of Tel Vos,[QUOTE] but that's where the trail ran cold.
I spent years looking for what became of the ship, but I ended up empty-handed.
Let me see that!
Yes... yes. This is it! I don't know how you found this stranger, but you've obviously succeeded where I had failed.
Please, let me offer you this key. It unlocks my strongbox under my stand in the marketplace. Help yourself to anything inside.
I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell.
He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time.
I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands.
Thanks, I was actually worried I'd run out.
Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me.
Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while.
And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it.
Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious.
The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent.
Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.
I have taught the Way of the Voice for centuries and the Thu'um since long before that.
But no, Dovahkiin. Others do not come here to train anymore. Saraan. You are the first in over a hundred years.
I meditate on the Rotmulaag - the Words of Power. I counsel in their use. It is enough for me.
Which calls to you, Dovahkiin? Fus, Feim, or Yol?
It is called [QUOTE]Force[QUOTE] in your tongue. But as you push the world, so does the world push back.
Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path.
su'um ahrk morah = [QUOTE]breath and focus[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Fade[QUOTE] in your tongue. Mortals have greater affinity for this Word than the dov. Everything mortal fades away in time, but the spirit remains.
Ponder the meaning of spirit. Unslaad zii. Where mortal flesh may wither and die, the spirit endures.
In your tongue, the Word simply means [QUOTE]Fire.[QUOTE] It is change given form. Power at its most primal.
That is the true meaning of [QUOTE]Yol.[QUOTE] Suleyk. Power. You have it, as do all dov. But power is inert without action and choice.
Think of this as the fire builds in your su'um, in your breath. Su'um ahrk morah. What will you burn? What will you spare?

I left Winterhold for some time, and returned to stay here at the inn.
I still have research that keeps me busy, and being here in Winterhold ensures I have access to former colleagues.
Try not to?
But I do realize it's sometimes not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing.
Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed.
You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon.
If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive.
But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties... erased. For a price. Something to think about.
By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Graybeards on their mountain!
By the gods! What manner of power is that?
The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
The Thu'um! She summons the Thu'um!
It is the power of old! The Voice of the Dragonborn!

Emphasis on the word [QUOTE]outsiders,[QUOTE] because that's the derogatory word Ulfric uses to describe memner of the other races.
I'll speak to Ulfric soon, but I make no promises that I can change his mind.
You have learned so much already, Dragonborn. Growing your gift too quickly would be dangerous.
But there are many Words of Power in Skyrim, carved in the Dragon tongue. Even from here, we can feel the Thu'um resonate from them.
Finding these lost Words would be a sufficient test, to temper your abilities with experience. Ask when you are ready to search.
There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.
We have felt the whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found.
You're a war hero, Brunwulf. Ulfric will listen to you.
You've seen how we live -- cramped alleys, run-down buildings, few guard patrols. Even the name [QUOTE]Gray Quarter[QUOTE] is an insult.
That's all I ask. With your help, we have a chance to make a better life for ourselves here. For that, I thank you.
I have responsibilities to attend to. We'll continue this discussion some other time.

There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.
Falk said I could count on you.
You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane.
Speak to Falk when you have the funds. And thank you.
Falk told me what you did for us at Wolfskull cave. He says you're someone we can trust.
As you may know Talos worship is outlawed in the Empire.
When we buried my husband I made offerings to all the gods... except Talos.
I would like you to take an item of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.
Yes, when we buried my husband I wasn't able to make an offering to Talos.
I was hoping you would to take something of his, a warhorn handed down from his father, and place it at a Shrine of Talos.
Thank you. It would mean a lot to me.
That's all right. Return to me if you change your mind though.
No but my husband Torygg would want a proper burial and this is the way Nords are buried in Skyrim.
I'll meet you outside of town.
Hey, don't you want to make this exchange?
Please don't leave. You must help me.
Not now.
You're interrupting the performance.
Come back to me if you find anything.

The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has.
Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.
One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine.
When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form.
The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse.
Clavicus gave him an axe.
Clavicus sent you didn't he?
You can't have the Axe! It's all I have left now!
We should go get the axe.
Let's get the axe and be done with this.
Now that guy was nuts.
Don't bother, Clavicus won't talk to me.
Wait a second, there's another option here.
I have a feeling I'm not going to like what happens when we get back to Clavicus.
All this just to kill me Clavicus?
You're worth putting in the extra effort for, pooch.
I remember that axe.
And I was so close to being rid of you.
I still don't have my Gleda back.
Don't come back until you have the ring.
The temple is still not clean. Get to it.

Once you leave the party you can't just come back.

Yes, Dean. Thank you.

In fact, If you collected parts of the Edda from any Bard you encountered in your travels I would be willing to pay you for them.
Wonderful. Just speak to various bards outside of the college, get there parts of the Poetic Edda and return them here to me.
Come back to me if you change your mind.
I do. I've been working on mine for a while now.
I suppose Giraud sent you for it? I was still trying to get the wording right but here it is.
Here you are. Always good to see a fellow bard. Tell Giraud I said hello.
This is part of me. Guard it with your life.
I've got it right here. Just don't read it, it's not very good.
Wonderful. Soon we'll have the latest section of the Edda complete. Keep up the good work.

You're in luck. There is a blessing the Blades used on the eve of battle. It's supposed to prepare the mind for slaying dragons.
I doubt the blessing's effects last for very long, so ask whenever you're heading out, and I'll perform the proper rites.

Well, I'm [QUOTE]not a scholar[QUOTE] of architecture. And that's that.
Do you ever think about them, Esbern? The others?
The other Blades? No. Best not to think what the Thalmor do to their victims, my dear.
You're right. Sorry to bring it up.
I've been writing some notes about all the Akaviri designs we've discovered. If only the Imperial Library could see my research.
Esbern, if the Empire could even acknowledge the Blades existence, we'd all have reason to celebrate.
Now, now my dear. I'm talking about academia, not politics.
There's a difference?
I've been chronicling the recent history of the Blades. What would you like your entry to say?
Come now. You did more than just survive all those years. Your evasion of the Thalmor would be useful for future Blades to study.
What? Your heroic tale of locking yourself in the Ratway for years isn't enough?
Have you ever heard of the expression, [QUOTE]the scale of the Argonian that bit you?[QUOTE]

You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades.
Do you wish to become a Blade?
Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?
Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed.
I am. The Blades of the 2nd Era hunted down many dragons in their day, and they have records of where the beasts lived.
Only you can truly defeat these monsters, Dragonborn, but you do not have to do so alone. The Blades can help you.
Just ask whenever you're ready to take on a dragon. We will send the Blades to help you fulfill your destiny.
It's quiet for now, Dragonborn. Perhaps later we'll find where one of those serpents is hiding.
I have. One of the old Akaviri records names a dragon living nearby. Shall we send the Blades to help you?
Good luck, Dragonborn.
Let me know when you are, then.
We're with you, Dragonborn.
It's good to see the Blades fighting alongside the Dragonborn once again. To think we're treading in the footsteps of thousands of years past.
While you're out hunting, keep a sharp eye open for any dragon scales and bones you might find. I'd be interested in looking at them.
Good. The dragon's soul should be making you stronger. Come back another time, and we'll track down another one for you.
Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.

Walking away without taking a job is like passing a bloated coinpurse on a table.

Use your skills, not your blade and you'll do fine.
No killin' or no pay. Remember that.
Remember, keep it clean. We don't want blood on our hands.

Hey, this guild needs the coin... walkin' away without takin' work is not going to make you popular around here.
There's plenty more work for the likes of you.
What's the matter, afraid of getting your hands dirty?
Where you off to? There's work to be done.
Only way this guilds going to continue to grow is by takin' extra work.

It was on a job a few years back... it was supposed to be a simple burglary on a house in Windhelm.
I was working with Vex and we got inside with no trouble. We found the loot, and made our way out.
Well it was, up until the point where we set foot outside. The house was surrounded by town guard... the client had ratted us out.
Vex just tells me to run, so I did. Half of them went after me, the other half went after her.
Are you kidding me? Vex lost them in seconds... once she steps into the shadows, she vanishes.
Me? I ran... and I ran... straight through the gates of Windhelm and all the way back to Riften.
Vex was waiting for me at the Flagon when I came in... drenched in sweat. Everyone just took a look at me and laughed.
Well, I had forgotten we had our horses tied up just outside of Windhelm... Vex rode hers back and arrived hours before I did.
So, that's how I earned the name. Now keep it to yourself.
I used to live in Valenwood working at my father's winery... we made the finest wine to ever cross your lips I promise you.
We were doing well, plenty of coin, a huge mansion and I was even betrothed to a lovely young woman.
Because it was dull. Every day was the same boring routine; working at the winery, social visits with friends, parties with no one I cared about.
I just wanted a little excitement. Something dangerous.
I hooked up with a guild in Valenwood... I think they called themselves the Silver Crescents. Spent quite a few years doing jobs for them.
Made a lot of coin, but I didn't care. I didn't really need it... I was running with them because it fit, made me feel alive.
Well, after a while my father caught on to what I was doing. He confronted me one night and gave me a choice.
Either leave Valenwood, or he'd have me thrown into jail. Gave me a day to say my goodbyes to everyone.
I ended up in Skyrim thanks to a contact I'd made when I was with the Crescents... good old Delvin.
He introduced me to Gallus, and that was it. I've been here ever since.
And you know what? Despite what I left behind, I don't regret it one bit.
Look, I don't really know you. I don't even really know anyone here.
Why do you care anyway? It's not like we're family. This is a business.
Look, you want to know about me? All right, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you about the time I was a young girl, barely out of her teens... living on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't have a coin to spend between our entire family. Ate the same slop we fed our livestock.
very sarcastic
get more angry.. more heated as you talk.
Furious now... anger should build until you realize the horror of what you're saying
calming down going into sadness
Carrying around a weight like that... it hurts after a while. Cuts you inside like a dagger to the heart.
very cold... distant
I never returned to that pig farm you know. There's nothing for me there.
So that's my sad story. What do you think?
Maybe one day, just not today.
Pull up a chair, my friend... this is quite a tale.
When I started out in this business, I wasn't really interested in the Guild or being a thief.
I didn't mean to imply I was earning an honest living either.
It's where a client pays you to get arrested, and you get thrown into a prison for the express purpose of breaking out.
Usually it's to free someone the client cares about... and sometimes to... well, to kill someone on their behalf.
Either way, the trick was in the escape, and that's where my strengths came in handy.
Well, as a jailbreaker, you work alone. No Guild to back you up.
I'd do jobs for the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood, but if things didn't go as planned, I was on my own.
The last jailbreak I attempted failed. I was imprisoned in High Rock for three years before they let me go.
After that I promised myself I'd never do it again.
I don't know. I think I realized that out in the world, my skills would bring me more wealth as a thief rather than an assassin.
Killing someone in a jail is much easier than what the Dark Brotherhood deals with. I guess I wanted to play it safe.
I already knew Delvin, I asked if I could join up, and that was that.
I joined up with them maybe ten years ago.
Small clan... maybe twenty men. We'd raid villages, rob caravans... but it was always about the killing for them.
Don't get me wrong. The first few years with that clan were some of the best years of my life.
All the food I could eat, all the wine I could drink and all the women I could bed.
We raided a caravan one spring... I think it was a few wagons with some farmers moving to a new village.
They didn't put up much of a fight. All that was left were the women and the children.
Then the leader of our clan... Garthek... he ordered us to kill the rest.
No, we usually let them go. I refused to do it, and Garthek ordered the clan to kill me as well.
Luckily, I had made some friends with the clan who immediately sided with me.
We tore each other to pieces. After it was over, those of us that remained simply went our separate ways.
I left his head on a pike at the wreckage of the caravan.
Never knew what became of the rest of the clan that survived. I suppose they moved on just like I did.
My father told me he found me as a young boy in the wreckage of a ship that sank off of the coast near Solitude.
All he found in my pocket was a tiny smooth stone inscribed with some sort of strange runes.
No one does. I've even taken the damn thing to the College of Winterhold.
I must have spent every last coin I've made with the Guild trying to find out what it means.
Perhaps. They could be nonsense... inane scribbles done by someone in idle boredom.
But if not... if they actually mean something, they might tell me where I'm from... what ship was I on. Everything.
Actually, the fisherman who found me, the man I call my father gave it to me.
Thought it was fitting I suppose. I never changed it, because it never felt right to do so.
Ah! Here it is.
I appreciate that.
It's kind of an amusing tale.
I was making my way down the road from Ivarstead towards Riften, and I saw Vex fighting off a couple of wolves.
Well, there were eight of them and she'd already killed three by the time I joined the fight.
Together, we made short work of them and the last one limped away licking its wounds.
laugh aloud at end
We scuffled for a while, broke each other's weapons, and finally fell to the ground exhausted.
Indeed.
After a few minutes, she looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I wanted to join the Guild. Just like that, no apologies.
Something told me I wouldn't regret it. I had heard the Guild was back on its feet again and most of Skyrim under its belt.
innuendo
Morrowind of course. Any Dunmer worth their weight in ash would tell you the same.
I used to be a member of the Morang Tong.
We were an assassins guild that was sanctioned by the Empire to provide public as well as private executions.
We did this in the name of Mephala, whom I used to quite fervently worship.
No. In fact, the Tong were quite the bitter rivals with the Dark Brotherhood.
Where they operate within the shadows, we operated on the side of justice.
I didn't have a choice. When the Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind, the Tong fled... spread to the nine winds.
We made a pact that one day, we might reunite... but I believe that day is long in coming.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
If the Dark Brotherhood discovered I had been a Morang Tong, they would come after me with a vengeance.
Better to stay out of sight and ply my trade with the Thieves Guild than risk a contract on my head.
I should hope so. The Dark Brotherhood is also known to place contracts on those who associate with the Morang Tong as well.
So, unless you wish a visit from one of their own, I'd suggest you follow your own advice and keep your mouth shut.
I knew this day would eventually come.
At least poor Sinderion died doing what he loved, his field research. I told the old fool he should take it easy, but he was too stubborn.
Perhaps someday I'll continue where he left off, it's the least I can do considering how much he did for me.
Crimson Nirnroot? I'd heard such a strain existed, but never imagined I'd see any in my lifetime.
Where did you find this?
pondering aloud to self
Of course! It's where my mentor, Sinderion said he was going to do his field research.
It's been... years I think, but perhaps you could still find him.
You've gathered quite a few of them I see.
I'll search through Sinderion's notes and find some more information about the Crimson Nirnroot and its properties.
You've done alchemy a great service by helping to complete Sinderion's work.
I'd like to give you this tome...it's one of Sinderion's greatest works. I believe you've more than earned it.
Where did all these pretty red plants come from?
Remember Uncle Sinderion? These are the plants he was searching for... the Crimson Nirnroot.
They're beautiful. I can see why he wanted to find them.
One day, these beautiful plants will make us famous and we can finally move off of this farm... thanks to Sinderion.
I used to be. There isn't much time for that in my life anymore I'm afraid.
I actually owned a shop in Vivec City long ago, but I had to leave all that behind when the Red Mountain erupted.
Perhaps someday I'll reopen a shop here in Skyrim.
Yes. He was an absolute genius when it came to the nirnroot.
Sinderion made it his life's work, developing all sorts of interesting concoctions.
When I was very young, I was sent to Skingrad in Cyrodiil to study with him.
chuckle lightly at end
Well, after I fled Morrowind during the eruption, I made my way here... my family had purchased this farm and its all we had left.
Years later, Sinderion simply showed up at our doorstep asking to stay for a while... said he was going to do field research.
He stayed with us for decades... became an uncle of sorts to Aduri.
One day he simply ran out to me in the field, excited that he'd made some sort of a breakthrough and he was going to head out on another trip.
He never returned. From the journal you discovered, I'm sure you know the rest.
Shocked, afraid.
'Father' in dragon. Shocked, afraid.
Ah, I think that'll do just the trick.
You'll need a little more coin than what you're floatin' around with.
One block lifts the other. Septimus will give what you want, but you must bring him something in return.
Oh, a brutish one. Septimus has no fear of you. But as one block raises another, perhaps ourselves could help us each.
You see this masterwork of the Dwemer. Deep inside their greatest knowings.
Septimus is clever among men, but he is but an idiot child compared to the dullest of the Dwemer.
Lucky then they left behind their own way of reading the Elder Scrolls.
In the depths of Blackreach one yet lies.
Have you heard of Blackreach? [QUOTE]Cast upon where Dwemer cities slept, the yearning spire hidden learnings kept.[QUOTE]
The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?
To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus.
The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm.
Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more.
Give it, quickly.
Extraordinary. I see it now.
The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.
Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it.
A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them.
The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key.
Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.
This isn't a good time.
The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.
That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean.
He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.
No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about.
[QUOTE]no matter[QUOTE] = [QUOTE]regardless of[QUOTE]
Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death.
You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.
Is that? Did you repair the blade?
Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.
And you avenged him.
this is a major concession, admitting that you were wrong
There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel.
We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.
Kodlak did not care for vengeance.
And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim.
Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be.
The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.
This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here.
This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Sister here.
[QUOTE]The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.[QUOTE]
The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more.
The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.
As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle.
I can't go any further, Shield-Brother.
I can't go any further, Shield-Sister.
Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me.
Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine.
I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor.
Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?
I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all.
You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.
And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger.
Let's go tell the others.
You're back.
Thank you. I'll be here.
I appreciate it.
Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.
I think her mother, Tova, has the key.
Her mother would have had the key, but she... that family is cursed, I tell you.
I don't want to be responsible for sending you to your death. Be careful in the mine.
Don't kid yourself... stone runs in our blood.
Darkwater Crossing is a difficult journey. Mind yourself.
Keep yourself safe, traveler.
Fortune to you and your children.
Redbelly Mine gets its name from the red mist filling the place.
You get used to it after a while... kind of smells like the hot springs out in the tundra.
No idea what's causing it though.
Mining iron takes a lot of strength and special reinforced tools.
I must have broken five or six pickaxes in the last few months alone.
But now that I've got Rocksplinter here, I can cut through stone like a hot knife through butter.
I might be a woman, but I can crack rock with the best of them.
Be careful in there, you can take a nasty spill.
Damn place is filled with this reddish mist. Can't see more than ten feet in front of your face.
But when you can sniff out a vein of iron like me, it isn't too much trouble.
It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it! Almost killed Grogmar and me when they showed up.
I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.
Go! We'll follow when we can!
yelling to get away from the flames
Gone? Every one of them? Why, that's incredible.
thrilled
Here, please accept this gift as a token of our gratitude.
Moved right in and made themselves at home. Did it overnight. I'm not even sure exactly where they came from.
No one's been hurt yet, and they seem to be staying in the mine, but who knows how long that will last?
If we can't get back into the mine, our town is sunk.
One day we were cracking rocks in the deepest parts of the mine and the next day they were all over the place.
I'd give my eye teeth if it meant getting those damn spiders out of the mine!
Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up.
I never asked you to help in the first place. Why would I? Everyone in Skyrim only helps themselves.
Wait... you mean you killed every last one of them? I can't believe it!
They're as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon. Gave me some sort of a line about [QUOTE]keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.[QUOTE]
What's the point in protecting this place if the mine's completely useless? Idiots.
My parents live there. I usually make the journey to bring them gifts and to just say hello, but I haven't been well lately.
I've written some letters and placed them in a satchel. Perhaps you wouldn't mind delivering it to them on my behalf?
It's a shame our daughter couldn't make the journey herself, but at least she still thinks of us.
If you wouldn't mind bringing this back to her for us, I'd appreciate it.
You would? Well then, I would insist on rewarding you for your time.
Here, take my satchel and give it to my father, Verner. He'll likely have something for you to bring back.
feel stupid for making a mistake
I was pretty bad off for a while, but a priest of Mara was passing through on his way to Dawnstar and healed me to the best of his abilities.
I'm still pretty sore and can't really walk too far without having to rest for a while.
Ah, yes... seems he sent back my satchel stuffed with letters. I look forward  to reading them.
I appreciate the delivery, here... I want you to have this. I insist.
Just pay them, Bersi!
Oh my word!
This isn't happening!

I think it's time we make this Guild Master thing official. Go and talk to Brynjolf, he's makin' preparations.
I heard Brynjolf is looking for you. I think it's time for the Guild to have a new leader.
So, they're making you leader, huh? Better go find Brynjolf so he can seal the deal.
I heard Brynjolf wants to see you about being Guild Master. I suppose my turn will come one day, but for now you'll do nicely.
So, they're making you Guild Master, eh? Good. Just find Brynjolf and he can make it official.
Brynjolf's been looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
Brynjolf tells me you'll make an excellent Guild Master. Oh, he's looking for you, by the way.
What are you doing talking to me? Didn't you know Brynjolf's been trying to find you? It's time to install you as Guild Master!
Brynjolf's looking for you. Something about becoming the Guild Master.
So, you're finally going to make Guild Master, eh? Well, you better track down Brynjolf to seal the deal.
Guild Master, huh? Well, guess we could do worse. Better go see Brynjolf about it.
Brynjolf told me he was looking for you about the Guild Master ceremony.
Did you know Brynjolf was looking for you? I think it's about the Guild Master ceremony.
Brynjolf's been looking for you. He wants to discuss the Guild Master ceremony. Congratulations... boss.
Well, my friend... the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master.
Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin.
I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer, anyway.
I'm not getting any younger. Let's get this ceremony done with.
So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!
Not now, it's time for the ceremony.
You need anything, anything at all... don't hesitate to ask.
We can talk after the Guild Master ceremony.
I am at your service.
Don't talk to me, you're supposed to be at the ceremony!
We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!
We'll chat after the ceremony.
I promise to live up to your expectations.
Shouldn't the ceremony be completed first?
Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.
We can get better acquainted once the ceremony's ended.
Congratulations, boss!
We can speak after the ceremony's done.
I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.
After Brynjolf has installed you as Guild Master, we can speak at length.
I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.
Not now, you idiot. We'll talk after this ridiculous ceremony.
Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.
Wait until the ceremony is over, then we'll talk.
As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you.
Hang on. When the ceremony's done, we'll talk.
laugh at end
Not yet... wait until Brynjolf's finished the ceremony.
I think everyone's waiting for the ceremony to get going.
We'll talk later... after this whole ceremony thing's over.
Here's to a long and prosperous future... may the Guild last another hundred years.
What are you doing? You're supposed to be attending the ceremony.
Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short.
Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order.
With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours.
Delvin?
Agreed.
Sure, why not.
Karliah?
Absolutely.
Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life.
Now everyone get back to work.
overworked, tired
tired, overworked
Fantastic. I was concerned I had asked for too many, but I'm glad to see you proved me wrong.
Let me at least give you something for your efforts... finding all of these couldn't have been easy... or cheap.
My goodness, how did you ever come by all of these?
No matter, I appreciate your generosity.
Come visit again sometime.
A few days ago, some thieves from Riften broke in here and stole it! Can you imagine? Took the only thing of value we had.
If you have the guts to head into the Ratway and get my bow back, I'll pay you what I can.
That's it! You found it!
I bumped into them when I was coming back to my farm after buying supplies.
I know those lowlifes took it with them back to the Ratway. They left an unmistakable stench behind.
It was a family heirloom. I can't even put a price on how much that thing means to me.
Thanks. It would be nice to have it back... means a lot to me.
Fine. I'll wait until someone else with a little more courage comes along.
That's it! That's my bow!
I don't know how you got it back, and I don't want to know. Frankly, I don't even care... I'm just so glad to see it again.
Here, this is all can afford to give you as compensation. Hope it's enough.
grumbling to self
The Ratway is somewhere under Riften, shouldn't be too tough to find.
Watch yourself out there or they'll take everything away from you.
Are you kidding me? We're all alone out here except for a few guards who couldn't give a damn about us.
We make easy pickings for thieves looking to steal everything we worked so hard for.
Not only did I they take my bow, but they took all of our coin as well. Nothing's sacred to these people.
He said he was going east towards the border of Morrowind to trade some of our grain to some folks at Broken Helm Hollow.
I waited and waited, and he never came back. Probably shacked up with some elven whore. Good riddance to him I say.
If I only knew where he was, I'd sure give him a piece of my mind.
almost crying
I've been a fool, wasting my time sitting here helpless when I could have sent help sooner. Perhaps this is all my doing...
What's done is done. Here, I want you to have this. Bringing me closure was kind of you.
Good. If you see him, tell him Grosta said he can go straight to Oblivion... he's not welcome here any more.
Doesn't matter. I'm sure he's long gone by now anyway.
Well, he said that a few men have been going by to some of the local farms promising a good price from all the local mills and farms.
Leifnarr said they'd pay double what you can usually get at the markets.
The catch was, he had to head out there with our wood. So not only is Leifnarr gone, but a good bit of our supplies as well.
Bye, mister.
Bye, lady.
Drop by and see us again if you're ever in the area.
Remember to tell that bastard I never want to see his ugly face again!
Quit taking advantage of us and this world might be a better place, you got that?
Don't let the men take advantage of you, always be on your guard.
With just myself and one child, it's damn near impossible.
With Leifnarr gone, it's really put me in a terrible bind. I'm having trouble making ends meet.
At this rate, we won't last more than a few more seasons at best. Then I'll just have to sell the old place.

But then Olfrid got rich an' decided he an his kin were too good for us simple, backwards Nord folk.
When the troubles began, he took the Empire's side. We haven't spoken much since then.
Well, first an' foremost there's repairs to make an' wounds to heal. Folks are depending on us getting the city back in working order.
Once things settle down, I'll be lookin' to recruit more guards for the city, then shore up our stores of food an' water.
The Empire might try an take the city back, or worse, we'll get a visit from a dragon. We've got to be ready for both.
Aye, with a certainty.
It was Talos that helped us win back the city. I'm as sure of that as the sun rising in the morning.
Amuse with yourself. The [QUOTE]hah![QUOTE] is a burst of laughter.
I won't say it again, Vignar - Talos worship is forbidden. It's the Empire's law, and we're still a part of the Empire.
A law made at the tip of an Aldmeri sword, aye. A sword stained red with Nord blood.
Is this what our people fought and died for? To forsake our most beloved ancestor and divine?
I'm no happier about this than you are, but I don't want the see the Thalmor rounding up people in the streets and throwing them in prison.

Well, it could be worse. The former steward, Proventus, kept very detailed records.
But yes, it's been a lot of work. Vignar doesn't want the change to disrupt the lives of his people. They've got enough to deal with already.
And we've done as much as we can to prepare for that.
Trying to sound confident, while not really feeling that way.
It's as rewarding as it is dangerous. Let's see what I can show you.
I think I can teach you a thing or two.
I can certainly share a bit of what I know.
You wish to learn from the best, eh? So be it.
I can. It might save your life.
You deal with powerful forces. Take care they do not overwhelm you.
I'll teach you some of what I know, but be careful.
I can teach you, but I won't be held responsible for what you do with the knowledge.
Mind what - or who - you practice this on.
You've come to the right place. I'd be happy to teach you.
I'll show you what I can about protecting yourself.
Use it right, and you won't feel a thing.
I shall explain to you the mysteries of the outer realms.
Your power over others shall be great, like mine.
I'll teach you how to use it effectively, and keep you quick on your feet.
You'll be able to run circles around the big, slow brutes in Heavy Armor.
All right, but if you get arrested don't blame it on me.
I'll show you what I know.
You'll never compare to me, but I can try and teach you anyway.
I can teach you a few things.
Up to no good, are we? I'll teach you, but it'll cost you.
I'll gladly share my knowledge with you.
It's an honorable craft. I'll show you what I can.
You wish to do what I do? Very well.
Stick with me, and they'll never even know you're there.
I can show you a few things, but anyone asks, and my name never comes up. Understand?
They'll never see you coming.
Well, you've come to the right place.
It's all in the swing. Let me show you.
The Thalmor hunted us down, remember? It wasn't exactly great for recruitment.
But we have a headquarters of a sort now. We'll rebuild the Blades. Someday.
If you find anyone you think would make a good recruit, I can certainly take a look at them.
Remember, though, being a Blade is a lifelong commitment. Their loyalty has to be with us once they're in.
Are you sure? I'll need to ask them to take an oath to leave their old life behind and stay here from now on.
You want this one to become a Blade? You're sure?
Very well. I'll do the oath later. Let's just get 'em geared up and ready to fight.
Very well. He seems like a fighter to me. I'll give him the oath.
Very well. She seems like a fighter to me. I'll give her the oath.
Right then.
If you find any more candidates bring them here.
I can handle training one more. After that, I think we'll be ready for a little dragon hunting of our own.
That's enough recruits for now. Ask Esbern about the dragon lairs he's been studying. We'll have the recruits do some hunting with you.

It's good to see you in one piece, lass!
I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done.
The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future.
What's become of the Skeleton Key?
That's it then. After all of those years of helplessly watching the Guild decline.
But enough of that... I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.
I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing... and no one skims!
If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out.
Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!

I'm not certain what use it would be.
The Staff is said to be able to absorb great amounts of energy. Perhaps it can interact with the Eye in a way that nothing else can.
I don't know, not for sure.
But perhaps the staff can absorb some of the energy coming out of the Eye, weaken it. Allow us to get close to Ancano.
I don't know. If the Augur suggested it, there must be a good reason for locating it.
I'm afraid I don't see the connection, though.
No more than anyone else, I don't think.
They're a very old order. Pre-dated the Imperial Mages Guild by quite a bit.
In fact, the Mages Guild was founded in opposition to the idea of the Psijic Order, that only an elite few should have control over magic.
No one has seen or heard from them in over a hundred years now, though.
I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course.
The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since.
And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing!
If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy.
Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here.
But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely.
Ah, that. Yes, the group prior to yours has disappeared entirely.
It's possible that there was less than the necessary amount of oversight. That's still being looked into.
But we've had no contact with them for quite some time now.
Arniel wondered if perhaps they'd somehow managed to get themselves lost in the Outer Realms, but I think that's giving them too much credit.
I'm not sure. None of them were working on anything terribly dangerous.
I hadn't really considered it in terms of time. I suppose it's been at least a month.
Let me think... what were they working on?
As I recall, Yisra was trying to improve flame cloak spells to better work in Skyrim's harsh environment.
Ilas-tei was practicing Illusions spells. She was having trouble with the calm spells, I believe, but only ever worked with skeevers.
And then there's Borvir and Rundi. Twins, though they rarely agreed on anything.
Those two boys were obsessed with mead. Convinced they could concoct something to compete with Honningbrew.
Something about using frost magic to chill the mead for a certain period of time. I felt it was a waste, but the Arch-Mage let them proceed.
None. It's been long enough that honestly, I don't expect to hear from them.
No, and after what you've discovered I fear the worst for them.

But she's not going to get the better of me, oh no. I won't let it get to me one bit. That's what she's after.
She's trying to undermine my confidence, make me doubt myself. Well it won't work, I tell you!

One of the ingredients I need to cultivate nirnroot are jazbay grapes... the acidic content of the juice is perfect for the soil.

His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.
Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you.
There's another piece, that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me?
I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.
Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we?
Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart.
I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.
It sounds like Eastmarch is too busy with their war to keep their own prisoners in line.
The braggarts in the Reach always claim that no prisoner escapes their mine.
What you don't hear about are the ones who break off from escorts on the way to Markarth.
Haafingar seems to have trouble keeping their prisoners in line.
I'm sorry to have to send you to Hjaalmarch. I can't stand the smell of it myself.
But it seems their criminals can't either and just want to get out.
It seems that law-breakers in the Pale have no desire to stay there. I don't blame them.
The idiots in Falkreath still think the best place for prisoners is that hole in the ground.
No surprise, but one of them's gotten out. Again.
The so-called prison in Riften leaks like one of their fishnets. This is what happens when you let thieves run your town.
The prisoners just walk right out.
One of the guards from Dragonsreach came to me, worried about a prisoner who's escaped.
The Jarl has too much on his mind right now, we won't be troubling him with this.
The snowberries up in Winterhold have lowered themselves to ask for our help.
For some reason they just throw their lawbreakers out into the sea and think that ends the problem.
But every now and then, one swims back.
One of them's escaped, and you're going to find that coward.
At this point they don't care what happens to him and neither do I. Best to just kill him and be done with it.
At this point they don't care what happens to her and neither do I. Best to just kill her and be done with it.
Be careful. This man is known to be dangerous.

We choose our battles, and you've chosen yours. Someone else can take care of it.
Bit by bit, we bring honor to this land. And you've brought honor to the Companions. More importantly, some gold.
Another job well done. Your payment is secure, and you have my thanks.
We have a bit of a sensitive matter this time.
A wealthy family has... misplaced one of their heirlooms.
Just in time. I was worried I'd have to do this myself.
Some rich folk had a trinket stolen and they want us to get it back.
I tell you this province is losing its grip. The bandits become more brazen every day.
Some don't even believe they exist, but the Falmer can be devious. Tunneling into homes, stealing off with valuables.
Those hill people who call themselves [QUOTE]the Forsworn[QUOTE] show no mercy.
Giants don't usually cause problems like this, but these ones are stirred up for some reason.
The rumors say the culprits are vampires. I try not to listen to swaggle like that, but figured you should know.
Of course, it's a group of wizards they're pointing their fingers at. Who knows what they want it for, but we want it back.
Good, good. These aren't the most glorious jobs, but they pay well.
Move quickly so we can have this over and done with.
We're trusting you on this one. Bring honor to the Companions.
Can't say I blame you. I'll find someone to take care of it.
Not the response I was hoping for, but suit yourself.
Give it here. They've asked for the utmost discretion on this matter, so I'll make sure it gets to them.
Here's your share of their reward.
And it looks undamaged. They'll be pleased, I'm sure. And we're pleased with their money.
Nice work with this one. You make us all proud.
Harbinger, I'd be honored if you joined me in my search.
I had once heard Skjor and Kodlak talking about the Totems of Hircine.
Simple-looking objects that could channel the powers of the werewolf in new directions.
say the word [QUOTE]cure[QUOTE] derisively -- he was seeking out a cure for something that you don't see as a disease
But I was going through his things and found a book I had never seen before. All about the Totems.
I've been talking to my sources around the holds, and think I may have heard where one of them lives.
I think I've located another one of the Totems. Come with me, and we'll write ourselves into their history.
I've finally tracked down the last of the Totems, I think.
The information wasn't easy to come by, but everyone has a price. And a pain threshold.

Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power.
The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of  every king who has worn it.
True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?

And here I figured you as one who enjoyed our special gifts.

Hardly likely.
Just shut up and keep out of sight.
That definitely matches the description of the totem from Skjor's old book. Let's get it to the Underforge.
That's it! That's the second Totem. Quickly, let's put it back with the other one.
At last... the final Totem is ours. Let's go complete our set.
Let's find that Totem, Shield-Brother.
Let's find that Totem, Shield-Sister.
Hircine will bless us for finding his Totem.
The spirit of Skjor is with us on this errand. I feel him.
This is not the time for talk. Let's get to the Underforge and see what this can do.
Do you have it?
I don't know what we do with it now. Maybe you can figure it out.
I've been hearing stories about dragons. That they're back. That they can eat the sun out of the sky and freeze a man where he stands.
Have you seen one in your travels?
Travelers have been coming to Whiterun. They tell stories about dragons.
I've heard of them, but didn't think they were real. Have you ever seen one?
I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Brother.
I envy you. Facing such a beast in combat. Smelling its blood on the air. That is what songs are sung about, Shield-Sister.
You are a very brave man. But I already knew that.
You are a very brave woman. But I already knew that.
A sharp mind on you. We should find out for ourselves.
That is the kind of thing Kodlak used to say. And he was right. But still, I'd like to see for myself.
the [QUOTE]yes[QUOTE] is slow but enthusiastic
They say he killed twelve of the Imperial Legion and shattered their bones with his breath.
I think you and I are worth about a dozen soldiers each. We'll send that beast back where it came from.
Well, that's one way to find out if they're real. I even know where we might find one. Lead on!
We don't all lead your life of grand adventure, Harbinger.
Not at this rate. I'll just go back to clubbing horkers and scaring the debtors.
Now that was a battle!
Thank you, Harbinger.
For the glory of the Companions! For Ysgramor!
We bring honor to the Companions.
I am sorry if I disappointed, Harbinger. Still, the battle was won.
I will train better for the future.
I'm going to stay a while. Rest among these bones. This creature honored us with its life, and I will honor it with my respect.
You go if you want to. I've never seen bones this large, and want to make sure I remember them so I can tell the story right.
Otherwise Vilkas will just say I was making it up.
There is always work for the Companions. But there is more personal task before me.
Of course, there is always work. My mind is someplace else, though.
Kodlak's final teaching. I think he was right about beastblood and Sovngarde.
I wish to cleanse myself that I might know glory in the afterlife.
I think that maybe Kodlak was right. As a werewolf, I can't be a good Nord.
I want to be clean, like he was, and go to Sovngarde when I finally die.
I would be honored for you to accompany me, Harbinger.
You still bear a head of the Glenmoril betrayers, yes? Then lead on, back to the Tomb of Ysgramor.
My soul is now prepared.
You still have one of the witch's heads. This is good.
Let's go to the Tomb. We can do the cleansing there.
Aela said that the cleansing used a head from one of the witches of Glenmoril, yes?
A strange kind of ritual, but I won't mind killing those wretched things.
Aela said we would need a Hagraven's head. I already have one of them, but she said it was a special kind.
And that you knew where to get more. Let's go find one!
Did you take the head?
Lead on, to Ysgramor and glory.
This is good. Could you show the way to the tomb again?
Is it over?
I... it's like waking up out of a dream.
I can breathe more deeply now. I can't smell your heart beating the way I used to. But my mind is... clear.
This is a great service you've done for me, Harbinger. I will not soon forget.
Now... I'd like to spend some time communing with Ysgramor. My soul is clean now. Perhaps he'll still welcome me when my time comes.
It's like relaxing into a warm mug of spiced mead. I'm losing aches I didn't know I had.
This is how a warrior should feel. Alive and aware. Not clouded with thoughts of the hunt.
Thank you for your help. I'm going to stay in the tomb for a while. My shame kept me out before, but now I want to see it.
You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite.
But the Elder Scrolls... they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one.
Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand girl?
I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions.
An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power.
To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness.
Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.
You think that even if I did have one here, I would let you see it?
It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.
Of course.
you're cut off in the middle of saying [QUOTE]What *about* him?[QUOTE] implying that he doesn't matter
I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books.
The simplest way to put it is [QUOTE]knowledge,[QUOTE] but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll.
It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts.
Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading.
But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.
It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense.
The Scrolls exist here, with us, but also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them.
Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad.
The mine is rich, and so are we.
But I am cursed, it would seem, to live alone.
I've had several wives. But each dies sooner than the last.
I was lucky to get children out of the ones I did.
Everyone said it had run out, but I smashed down one wall and found the widest veins of ebony I'd ever seen.
So now we're rich and now I'm chief.
I think of Uglarz. An old friend. When we were little she ran to the woods to hunt, and never came back.
If someone found her, she would make an excellent mate.
Ha. Good luck to you, friend. She's not one who likes to be found.
I am Uglarz, huntress of all.
It was my home. But I left. The woods felt more alive, at least for a time.
Mauhulakh. I remember him. Little, scrawny, fellow.
Ha! Now that I would like to see. I may go back there some day.
Always thought that old mine had more to it. Just like Mauhulakh to smash his way to good fortune.
I'm going back to Narzulbur. Want to see how it's come.
My Saffir doesn't like that I've been spending so much time looking for my father's old sword.
He fed his entire family with the gold he made using that weapon. I'm not about to let it gather dust in some thief's trophy room.
We have not faired well outside our native Black Marsh, but we're determined to make the best of things.
I began praying to Zenithar, the god of wealth, to bring us some fortune, but thieves made off with my sacred amulet almost as soon as I bought it.
I tracked it to a group of bandits nearby. But I'm no fool. I'd need the Whiterun guards or maybe hire the Companions to get it.
I don't know why I'm saying this, but if you find it out in your travels, I'd be grateful to you.
Shahvee would be in your debt, kind one.
We will endure. We always have.
Not your concern, anyway.
Very good. Be sure to bring any more Sleeping Tree Sap you find to me.
Yes, Nightingale, what is it?
A moment, please.
I wish to speak to Karliah for the moment.
Gallus!
I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He honors us all.
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. She honors us all.
What will you do now, my love?
Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.
Will I ever see you again?
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again.
Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open... walk with the shadows.
Goodbye, Karliah.
Gallus's Oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms.
Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam... the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.
No, not gone... he's become one with the shadows.
This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can possibly achieve. In death, he's become a part of that which we use to live.
Absolutely. When we say [QUOTE]walk with the shadows,[QUOTE] we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us.
It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck... by placing their hands in ours.
That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there.
said with a knowing wink
If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call.
Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish.
Farewell. Eyes open and walk with the shadows.
While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations.
Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you the living quarters.
There are no expectations. This College is a place to study and practice magic freely.
Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with the members of the College first. That way we all benefit.

I'll be glad when that beast is gone from Dragonsreach. I never understood what the point of all this was.
Capturing that dragon was a mighty deed. In my younger days, I'd have been the first to join in the attempt.

One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim.
I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justiciars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war.
The Thalmor Justiciars are so often misunderstood. Our primary goal is to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion.
The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War.
Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers.
The Empire and the Dominion agreed that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace.
But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.
As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations, my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of Skyrim.

The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn.
I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside.
When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence.
The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it... a ruin within a ruin?
There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.
Perhaps my prayers were answered and your reason for stumbling across Dawnstar is more than a mere coincidence.

A word of advice, my friend --  do not mix gambling and drink. Taken together, they will empty your pockets of every septim.
Well, not a great deal, no.

No more than I was already getting.
Four of the guards have already decided they're in love with me. Two of the guards got into a fight over me at the tavern.
At least Balgruuf's men bathed regularly. These Stormcloaks always smell of ale and sweat, and their breath reeks.

There he devours the souls of the heroic dead to feed his power. You must find his portal to Sovngarde before he returns, stronger than ever.

Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests.
bemused
As part of their [QUOTE]duties,[QUOTE] the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf.
These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated.
One of their ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so called [QUOTE]test of worthiness.[QUOTE]
If a pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said that they would become one with the shadows. What that means is anyone's guess.
The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim... well, longer than recorded history.
The Twilight Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield it from those who would exploit its power.
It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery.
Trust you saw the house that burned down. Peculiar bit of business, that was.
And that's on top of noises from the marsh in the night, tales of monsters, and now this wizard in our midst.
What's a man to do if he can't look to his Jarl for help?
sheepish
They haven't made me a guard, even though I've been asking. So I'll take odd jobs, anything that comes along for now.
Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and nearly any money I make, he drinks away.
Without the coin to pack up and leave, I decided to take to trading.
Options were in short supply. Ranmir and I grew up here, and his drinking soaked up whatever coin we had.
So I opened a shop to try and get by. Now, though...
slightly amused at the thought
It's not much, but we get by.
Very little money passes through Winterhold anymore, but if there's one thing you can count on, it's folks needing a drink now and then.
Suppose it's the same answer, either way. Winterhold's fallen on hard times, to say the least. Most folk packed up and left years ago.
A few of us are either too stubborn or too crazy to go, so we do our best to make a living.
By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant.
I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we?
We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.
hesitating over [QUOTE]learned[QUOTE] - the player later finds out it was Delphine who told him about this
Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet - no doubt interred in the main chamber - and bring it to me. Simplicity itself.
surprise and admiration
Very well.
The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.
Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus.
Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me.
Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus.
Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.
Just that, I'm afraid. You lack the ability, in any school of magic, to contribute meaningfully to the College's research.
I suggest you learn more on your own. Come back once you've attained some measure of success.
Fralia, do you ever deal with the Khajiit at all? I'm sure they would love to trade in your husband's steel.
Plenty of people here that need Eorlund's craftsmanship, my dear. We've never had any reason to deal with those caravans of theirs.
Are you still working at the Bannered Mare in the evenings, Olfina?
And why shouldn't I? Just because I'm a Gray-Mane doesn't mean I can't earn my own keep.
I didn't mean... I'm sorry I asked.
Ah, Ysolda was it? What brings you to the market?
I'm here to buy food, Nazeem. I suppose you don't need to worry about that.
Owning a farm does have its advantages.
Did you see a Dog out there?
Ah, well. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
No, this was a specific one. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
I don't know really.  The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it.
I asked the gate guards to look for him. I can't afford to chase him down but could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat - check the road just outside of town.
No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
If you were willing to retrieve him for me I'd give you some fresh meat to attract him out on the road.
I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.
You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out.
mildly annoyed
It's coming along slowly. I expect there will be some results soon.
We were able to figure out the last text you brought in. I thought the least I could do is pass the knowledge along.
Now... Now we see whether my theories are correct.
I apologize if I have not been clear about my work. I didn't want to discuss it for fear this moment might never come.
Everyone knows the dwarves disappeared. No one knows why.
This little experiment is a first step in recreating the events of their disappearance in an effort to unravel that mystery.
Lacking the heart of a dead god, I am substituting the crystal you helped craft in its place.
I also lack Sunder, the counterpart to the dagger Keening. I am reasonably, confident, however, that this will still work.
making a joke that no one is ever going to get, realizing it's awkward
Well, I suppose it's time, isn't it? Let's see what happens. You, uhh... You may want to stand back a step or two.
But please, don't leave. You've been instrumental in this process. I'd like you to see the results first-hand.
about to take a leap of faith, slightly hesitant
Hmm. That... That didn't really do anything, did it?
Perhaps a little harder?
confused, starting to get upset
Work, damn you!
Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.
Why am I fighting?
I really don't want to fight.
I see no reason to keep fighting.
This fight makes no sense.
I'm not interested in fighting anymore.
I see no reason to fight.
There's no reason to fight.
I'm staying out of this.
This fight is pointless.
Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way.
I really do need you to stay in place, please. I don't want to risk hurting any of the other Apprentices.
The existence of so-called [QUOTE]Doomstones[QUOTE] throughout Skyrim has been repeatedly verified. The meaning of these stones has not.
The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature.
While there is no direct evidence of this, it does seem likely.
References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures.
None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones.
At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones.
Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern.
Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon.
The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined. It has been widely assumed that they were placed during the Merethic Era.
Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified.
Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power.
The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste.
It is no secret that both the Synod and the College of Whispers have recently made inquiries as to the status of our College here in Winterhold.
At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence.
The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.
Aren believed that although the initial communications were innocent enough, they were sent with a particular motive in mind.
The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies.
It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization.
Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod.
They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy.
The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research.
Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.
Our actual position and policies are irrelevant. No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group.
Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side.
At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor.
They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.
Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.
Arch-Mage Aren believed that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur.
Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College.
If either group goes through less official channels and attempt to contact you directly, please refer them to the College's Master Wizard.
Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.
I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic.
It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals.
Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things.
Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored.
Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace.
I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay.
Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations.
They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility.
But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact.
Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm.
I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you.
As many know, there is an ongoing effort to research the work of the Archmagus Shalidor.
He is most remembered for his great maze of Labyrinthian, said to hold [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE], or the secret of life.
While stories have persisted since the First Era, none have ever confirmed the existence of this [QUOTE]Glamoril[QUOTE] or its purpose or function.
The College has developed some theories, however.
We know that Shalidor had an understanding of magic that surpassed almost any of either his age or ours.
The few works of his that have been recovered suggest that he had an understanding of magic and the world that few have ever achieved.
What is interesting is that it appears he was also incredibly prolific, writing on a diverse array of subjects.
An array so great, in fact, that it remains a source of curiosity.
What, then, of this Glamoril? It means [QUOTE]secret of life[QUOTE] in elvish. Could this be an explanation for Shalidor's works?
Is it possible that it somehow contributed to his work? Perhaps allowed him to life multiple lifetimes in a short span of time?
Increased his intelligence and knowledge in ways unfathomable to us? We may never know for certain.
The College is always searching for more of Shalidor's writings in an attempt to understand both our knowledge of the man, and of magic in general.
At this time, I would like to make a few statements regarding policy here at the College.
Please refrain from practicing Conjuration spells in view of the town of Winterhold.
Atronachs have a tendency to frighten the locals. Undead.... well, I don't even think it needs to be said.
Urag has asked me to remind everyone to please return materials borrowed from the Arcanaeum in the same condition as you received them.
If this is impossible due to misuse or accident, Urag recommends finding a replacement copy to deliver to the Arcanaeum.
Failure to do so will result in paying, in Urag's words, [QUOTE]a blood price.[QUOTE] I did not ask him to elaborate on that point.
Once again, I must ask that everyone please clean up any materials used in the common areas.
We've had yet another sprained ankle due to soul gems being left on the floor. Let's please try and keep injuries to a minimum.
The Midden remains off-limits at this time; while the initial outbreak has been cleaned up, the area is still considered hazardous.
No more experiments are to be carried out there, and mages are advised that you enter the Midden at your own risk.
While Drevis appreciates the spellcasting skill that went into somehow cramming several hundred apples into his pillow...
He would ask that it please not happen again.
He has suggested that, should he find out who is responsible, he is well versed in making things disappear permanently.
There have been unconfirmed reports that someone has been sneaking into the town of Winterhold while invisible, and causing... issues.
This goes quite against College policy, and the party responsible is advised to cease these actions at once.
Any information as to the whereabouts of the previous group of Apprentices would be greatly appreciated.
As of yet, there has been no sign of them.
Projects are underway to discern the origin and nature of the College's recent find in Saarthal.
Work continues on the Eye of Magnus, as it has been commonly referred to.
Any and all theories are currently being considered. Those with ideas should please speak with Mirabelle.
At this time, there is no indication that, as has been rumored, the object is in fact a physical part of Magnus, the god of magic.
It has been suggested that the object is a gateway to the realm of Aetherius, but nothing has proven that idea one way or the other.
It has been proposed that the object is in fact the entirety of Aurbis in one physical space.
This would of course mean that Tamriel, indeed all of Mundus, is actually contained within the sphere.
It further suggests that we are somehow then outside our own existence while looking in at it.
While the idea seems dubious at best, it has not, at present, been entirely ruled out.

Come... embrace your death!

Draw your last breath, mortal!
Your presence will be revealed.
You can't hide from the hidden.
Enough games, face your death!
Hiding only prolongs your demise.
I have eternity to find you.
Impressive, you've mastered the shadows.
A stirring in the dark?
I feel a change in the room...
The presence of the living is near...
The shadows have betrayed you!
The games have ended, time to face your death!
Come mortal, let's end this here and now!
Nocturnal will feed upon your soul!
An intruder in the Sepulcher!
Make your peace, mortal!
Defend the Sepulcher at all costs!
Destroy the intruder!
Let the darkness rip you asunder!
You've breathed your last breath, mortal!
Defend the Ebonmere! Kill the mortal!
I cast shadows across your grave!
A trick of the dark perhaps?
Perhaps it was nothing...
Victory for Nocturnal!
Another soul claimed for Lady Nocturnal!
Glory to the Empress of Murk!

I've failed... the mortal has escaped.
What? That's not possible!
Most impressive, mortal... most impressive.
The shadows have failed you!

Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons.
For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play.
No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.
The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.
trying to be cheery in grim situation
A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities.
The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.
Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago... before they became the blind monstrosities they are today.
When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold.
Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.
a moment of elation from greed
Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well.
There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.
See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going!

Jarl Balgruuf? I don't mean to be disrespectful, as he's ruled Whiterun Hold well for years, but he seems in over his head now.
He's been trying to stay out of the war, but it can't last. He's going to have to pick a side. I'm afraid he's going to make the wrong choice.
with a derisive snort
But it's hard to believe that even Balgruuf would choose Elisif over Ulfric.
Of course. Ulfric's cause is just. It's time for Skyrim to rid itself of the Empire.
I suppose she's Jarl Elisif now. She married High King Torygg just before Ulfric killed him. The Empire supports her claim to be High Queen.
I don't really have anything against her - not her fault that her husband Torygg was bought and paid for by the Empire.
But she's nothing but a puppet for the Empire now, with her husband Torygg dead. Ulfric will make sure she never takes the throne as High Queen.
Some say murdered, but it was a lawful challenge in the old way.
Ulfric called him out as a traitor to Skyrim, and killed him in single combat.
If Torygg couldn't defend his throne, he had no business being High King.
No, not until the Moot meets to choose another. And it won't meet until one side or the other wins the war.
Don't worry, though. Ulfric is our rightful High King. He'll drive out the Empire and Skyrim will have peace at last.
But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar.
As a token of my esteem, I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city.
And please accept this gift from my personal armory.
Bottles of Moon Sugar. Khajiit use it as a... pick me up. Good way to pass the time.

Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense.
Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny.
Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.
If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved.
confiding - lower voice a bit as if Karliah might overhear
Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercer's blood on my blade than spend the rest of my life regretting that I ran the other way.
With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts.
A bit perturbed that the Player doesn't get it
In order for us to receive our abilities... our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.
If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me... with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call.
I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.
Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your home.
You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn.
Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.
Years ago, the Guild used to have a foothold in every major city in Skyrim. You wouldn't dare even lift an apple without checkin' with us.
When things started goin' downhill around here, it became difficult to keep it all together. We lost fences, influential contacts and coin.
It wasn't long before we lost what we depend on to survive... respect.
By doin' these extra jobs and puttin' some fear into the people, we can take back the cities and start bein' taken seriously once again.
Are you kidding me? Ever since the Guild's luck turned sour, we haven't had a coin to our name.
And when the coin dried up, that's when people started to leave.
We had the best of everything down here... the Ratway was a damn palace.
The only way this place will ever return to its glory days is if we can finish these extra jobs and start the gold flowing again.
Thanks to Maven Black-Briar, we still have some pull in Riften. But get arrested in Whiterun and you'll be tossed right into the prisons.
If we can gain the confidence of someone very influential who lives there by doing a unique job for them, we'd be able to have some leverage there too.
The only way to get that special job is by doin' smaller ones in those cities until we catch their ear... then they'll contact me and we're off.
The Flagon was once a city beneath a city. We had our own smith, our own alchemist... you name it.
If we can make a name for ourselves in Skyrim once again, I can almost promise you those merchants would return.
Best of all, we'd have enough gold to throw around so we can start living in the lap of luxury again.
I'm here to assist anyone interested in joining the College. Also, my presence tends to frighten the locals and keep them away.
The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it. Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end.
Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight.
The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city.
The College survived, and so here we remain.
Purpose? I should think it's self-evident.
Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians.
It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study.
The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us.
Purposely killing your fellow College members is a bad idea. I'd advise against it. Theft and assault can get you into trouble as well.
As for research... Well, a sufficient explanation will cover almost anything.
If you're going to need live test subjects for your experiments, it's easier to do that off of College grounds.

You're growing impatient.
Go. Your very presence sickens me.
Be warned. You have been marked by the Thalmor.
Now remove yourself from my presence, while you still draw breath.
Go now. Return to your pathetic pursuits.
Filthy Nord. In time, your entire race will be eradicated.
The Justiciars know your face. And we elves have long memories...
Back to the swamp with you, Argonian. Lest I carve you into boots.
Crawl back into whatever pit spawned you, Orc.
Slink away now, little Khajiit, with your tail between your legs.
Flee from my sight, Dunmer, or I'll have you shipped back to Vvardenfell in a crate.
Pathetic excuse for an elf...
You are a disgrace to the Altmer. I should kill you on general principle.
You drove them off? By yourself?
Thank you! We'll head back to work, right away. Take this, it's the least I can do.
The Jarl has recognized you as a person of great importance in the hold. A hero.
The title of Thane is an honor, a gift for your service. Guards will know to look the other way, if you tell them who you are.
This here's Rorikstead. Quiet place. Good people, though. You can get a room and a mug at the Frostfruit Inn if you care to stay.
That's the Honningbrew Meadery. Supposed to be a big rivalry between them and the Black-Briars of Riften.
Remember when that used to be the Honningbrew Meadery? Didn't stand a chance against those Black-Briars of Riften.
This is Karthwasten. Mining town. I hear they've had a lot of trouble with the Forsworn.
This here's the Darkwater. Comes down from Lake Honrich into the White River, a few miles downstream. Good fishing, I hear.
Morthal, capital of Hjaalmarch hold. Not quite in the same league as Solitude or Whiterun, but a nice enough place if you like swamps.

I can't say I've been to Winterhold more than a handful of times. Can't see much reason most honest folk would want to come up here.
Well, this is Falkreath. Not much to look at if you're used to the bigger cities, but the folk here are friendly enough if you give them a chance.
The Braidwood Inn's up that way. I know the innkeeper - Iddra. Nice lady.
Shor's Stone - pissant little town, not even an inn. Just a bunch of miners scratching in the dirt.
It seems we may have an agreement.

It worked, then? Let me see!
Goodness, that's it, isn't it?!
Yes! It's not perfect, but it's a close enough approximation that it should certianly suffice for initial tests!
You've done excellent work here. Truly excellent. There's only one thing missing now, and that should be arriving shortly.
I'll begin preparations. Thank you again so much for this.
How in the name of Akatosh... How do you have that?

Keening, one of the great tools of Kagrenac himself, is finally in my possession. I don't think I really believed this day would come.
Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment...
Now, let's see what there is to see.
It's magnificent, isn't it?
I need only look for a few moments...
Ahh, yes. I see it now.
And so it is done.
I have the knowledge I need. And so you may have your stone back, and also please take this.
proud but reserved
Good. One less worry for my people.

Damn right. Just like all true sons of Skyrim should.
Damn right. You don't have to be a Nord to fight for Skyrim's freedom.
Ulfric's capital is Windhelm, northeast of here. You'll want to talk to Galmar Stone-Fist, Ulfric's right-hand man. He handles the new recruits.
I'll be sure to put in a good word if I get to Windhelm ahead of you.
You should come to Windhelm with me and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.
If anyone will know what the coming of the dragon means, it's Ulfric.
I hope so. Skyrim needs people like you to fight for her freedom.
Come on, we'd better get moving.
Yeah, sure, I understand. No need to decide now.
But I know that after you think about what you saw today, you'll realize that Skyrim deserves to be free.
No way to know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here.

Stalking your prey, planting false evidence, destroying an innocent man's reputation. Truly a contract worthy of the Listener.
The Keeper is a sacred position within the Dark Brotherhood. Ask yourself - do you trust the wisdom of our Lady?
I will kill this jester if you so desire, but there is a disturbance in the Void. Our Dread Father does not wish this.
Killing the Gourmet will leave an emptiness in the collective soul of Skyrim. This pleases me.
Yes. Kill the chef, and then steal his very identity. For that is the true death.
A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself.
My time saw the assassination of an Emperor as well. Alas, the Dark Brotherhood did not have the honor of that kill.
We must return to the Sanctuary! Your Family is in dire peril!
We are the messengers of death, you and I. Together, we will unleash the unholy wrath of our Dread Father, Sithis.
The Sanctuary must be purged of its invading filth!
The time has come to fulfill your destiny, Listener. Kill the Emperor, and restore the Dark Brotherhood to greatness.
You stand now at the precipice of the Void. I am reminded of another Listener, a protege I knew long ago. So long ago...
Ah, yes. Solitude. Seat of the High King of Skyrim. Messy business, kingslaying. Ah, but so very satisfying...
Windhelm. White as bone, and cold as the Void.
I do so love Riften. I journeyed here in my youth. A thief took my purse... so I took his eyes. It was a fair exchange.
Whiterun, home of the Skyforge. It is said a blade forged in its fires can cut through sinew as if it were parchment.
An ancient city, Markarth. Build by the Dwemer, the dwarves of old. To think, an entire race... eradicated. Not even I can take credit for that feat.
Do you feel it? Magic. Deep and ancient. It resonates from the College, like the beating of a heart.
You know, a good Purification might be just what this Sanctuary needs...
Dreary, dank, and dimly lit. Truly a Sanctuary to call home.
Shadowmere, my old and dear friend...
All hail the savior of the Dark Brotherhood! All Hail the Listener!
One day, you will serve our Dread Father as I do now.
I remember Skyrim from my youth, and the glistening crimson on fields of white.
I live... again.
I grow restless. As does my blade.
Your enemies will soon know the wrath of Sithis.
Lead, and I will follow, child of darkness.
Perhaps we should find a random stranger to murder. Practice does make perfect.
Lead on, sister.
Lead on, brother.
We are bonded now, you and I. Joined, through the powers of the Void.
In life, I was but a Speaker for the Black Hand. But you have been named Listener. There is no higher honor.
Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal? Kill a boy's mother, and vengeance festers in the son...
My blade is yours.
There is murder in the air. I can taste it.
The Dread Father works through me. And his work has just begun.
My Listener?
What prey awaits us?

Then we have nothing more to talk about.
You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you.
You're making a point of saying this line in a manner both loud and demonstrative, to show your courage even while there are enemy soldiers nearby.
Ulfric fought for that dream with more courage and honor than any Nord who ever lived. But now he's gone, and the dream is gone with him.
Determined, resolute
I've scraped this collection together by whatever means I could.
I do some business with the trade caravans, and I've picked up a number of items from adventurers like yourself.
A few intrepid souls even brought some items back from Morvunskar, the fort southwest of the city.

You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl.
But beware - the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you.

with cold anger
a bit stiffly since you've just been insulted by Ulfric as a puppet of General Tullius
doing your best to be diplomatic - not your forte. fumbling for the right thing to say here.
The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.
After that, Ulfric... there will be a reckoning. Count on it.
You did well here today. I don't think the truce will last long, but that will not be on your account.
I fear this truce will not last. You gave the Empire too much. Ulfric will not let that stand for long.
I fear this truce will not last. General Tullius will be looking for any opportunity to regain the advantage.
You had best take advantage of this truce while it lasts.
On your way up the 7,000 Steps again, Klimmek?
Not today. I'm just not ready to make the climb to High Hrothgar. The path isn't safe.
Aren't the Greybeards expecting some supplies?
Honestly, I'm not certain. I've yet to be allowed into the monastery. Perhaps one day.
Hey, remember that girl, Eisa? The one who sliced open that pickpocket they threw in here?
The Blackblood girl? Now there was a fighter. If I didn't know better, I'd say she was a Forsworn woman.
Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.

So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons.
Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me.
Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it.
I don't know if you've heard, but Jarl Balgruuf said my work is a priority. Which means you should be on your way.
I want to hear about this dragon.
I wonder what Irileth is so excited about?
The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice - the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout.
If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.

Not sure. I know that it starts with Moon Sugar, but all sorts of other ingredients are added to increase its potency.
Used to be a lucrative underworld commodity when Balmora was still standing. Now the stuff is beyond valuable.
It's also very illegal. Anyone caught with Balmora Blue looks forward to rotting in jail for a very long time.
There's pirates and then there's the crew of the Red Wave. They're in a class by themselves.

If you leave that kinslayer Hroggar, I would be happy to keep your company.

In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block.
When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield.
Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow.
Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again.
Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.
Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one.
Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening.
Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.
Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.
If you want to sharpen your blade, use the grindstone. Although you'll need the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.
Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.
If you want to make new armor or weapons, use the forge. It takes plenty of raw materials though, such as iron or steel.
Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter.

Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems.
Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well...
Wait for me.
Oh, I thought you were already on your way to Bleak Falls Barrow...
What are you still doing here? The Jarl said retrieving that stone tablet is a priority. Remember?
Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!
airily dismissive
That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim.
My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.
My... associate will be pleased at your resourcefulness. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.
What are you in for, new blood?
Innocent? So was I, for the first one. The other murders were all me, though.
Petty thieving, huh? Just like poor Grisvar. Hopefully you'll learn your lesson faster than he has.
Violent one, huh? Best keep that to yourself, new blood. Others find out, they'll consider that a challenge.
I hear you're in for life. Sad. I'd get a shiv if I was you, or maybe some Skooma to drown your troubles.
My advice? Serve your time at the pickaxe and get out. You don't want to end up getting a shiv in the guts over a bottle of Skooma.
They come in here once a week to clean out the bodies, grab any ore we've mined, and beat down the troublemakers.
That's the only time when we get food, too. And if there's not enough ore mined up, we don't get any.
A Nord nobleman I served was stabbed in the night. Wasn't me, but I knew I'd be blamed.
So I ran. Joined the Forsworn. Started killing. Got caught. Now I'm here.
Because life was better under the old ways. No Nords and their laws.
One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in your kinsmen's blood. Best you not be there on that day, Nord.
One day, the Forsworn will paint the walls of Markarth in their blood.
Small blade. Easy to hide. I mean, sure, you could just swing a pickaxe into someone's face, but people tend to see that coming.
Got a problem with a prisoner? Get a shiv. Hear Grisvar has a spare, if you could get him to part with it.
Ah, you want protection? I can get you what you need.
Maybe you can do something for me, first? Duach has a bottle of Skooma. Finest distilled Moon Sugar. I'm shaking just thinking about it.
Ah, you're a clever one aren't you? Now, here's your shiv. Promise you won't ever use it on me, okay?
Thank you, friend. Don't worry. I'll have that shiv ready for you.
All right, but if you change your mind. Not like we're going anywhere.
You give me one more look, and I cut you open. That Skooma's mine.
Getting the shakes, huh? All right. Take it. Old gods keep you.
Skooma addict. Get lost.
Easy there. I didn't mean nothing. Take it.
That's it.
Smart.
laughing at the end, ingratiating weasel
Every blade I make honors Malacath. Every rivet, every plate of armor is for him.
Only a true Orc knows how to temper Orichalcum properly.
The old traditions are passed down from one generation to the next. The secrets of smithing are passed down as well.
Lob will one day take my place, and bring honor to our tribe as I have.
I learn much from Garakh every day. I must learn if I am to take her place.
I've worked with metal long enough that I almost never burn myself anymore.
My weapons will someday be as strong as my mother's, and Malacath will be pleased with me.
The days of staying within Largashbur's walls are over.
Malacath demands much of us now. We will not fail him again.
Gularzob has been chosen as chief. He will one day be great, but he has much to learn.
Largashbur will not soon forget what you have done. We have a second chance thanks to you.
The ways of the mystic are known to me. I have remedies and cures, should you need them.
It is good to finally know that Malacath has not forsaken us.
We have learned from our mistakes. Malacath's needs come first, and we will serve him faithfully.
I will do my best to lead the tribe, but I don't know why Malacath chose me.
I am honored to have been chosen to lead. But I know that being picked by Malacath does not mean that I am ready.
Yamarz betrayed us all. I will never allow that to happen again, so long as I rule.
Do not raise arms against my people, and you shall always have a place here, Champion of Malacath.
Atub is wise beyond her years. I take her advice seriously, and you should as well.
I am... surprised that Gularzob was named chief.
We are all blood here. One family, one tribe.
I will serve Gularzob as best I can, even though I am his elder.
These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I.
To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Daedra to retrieve one for us.
You will summon a Dremora, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.
I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event.
Once you have summoned the Dremora, you will order it to deliver to you a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
Once I have the sigil stone, I shall inscribe the spells that you seek.
If only that were true.
Because I have no wish to be harmed.
Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding.
You must first prove you are in control.
Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.
I serve no mortal!
You control nothing, mortal!
wounded and near death
Please step back, there's an execution in process.
Last warning. Stand back from the execution.
Ask any fool around here, and get a different answer.
Mercenaries. Warriors of honor. Brothers and sisters of the blade. Drunken rabble. Take your pick.
I've been here longer than most of them. Even I don't know sometimes. I just hope they don't kill each other.
The Companions are my family. We fight so that other people don't have to.
We bring honor and glory to ourselves and each other.
You'll hear some of the brighter faces around here talk about honor and glory.
I've got nothing against it, but for me, the promise of coin is what feeds my blade.
Wherever someone in Skyrim doesn't feel up to defending their own honor, we'll take up their burden.
Your question carries more weight than you may know, newcomer. The sort of thing some of us spend our lives pondering.
The difference between a noble band of warriors and a ragged bunch of assassins is as thin as a blade's edge.
I try to hold us to the right path.
Why would you even come to Jorrvaskr without knowing what we stand for?
This is not play-acting, here. We are the true spirit of Skyrim. Honor is in our blood, death in our hearts.
If you seek either, you've found the right place.
Are you looking to join? I wouldn't get your hopes up.
The short answer is: we fight. The long answer is... eh, forget it. You're not worth my time.
Only the most famous warrior band in all of Skyrim. Have you been living with the horkers?
When we arrive, blood is spilled and our blades sing to the glories of Ysgramor.
We're the best damned fighters in Skyrim. At least, some of us are.
They used to be something. Nowadays they just squabble amongst themselves.
Take my advice and keep away. You look too smart to get caught up with this bunch.
To hear Vignar tell it, they're a bunch of layabouts and useless whiners who used to know how to fight.
But he thinks everything used to be better. I, for one, would trust any Companion with my life.
A good bunch of men and women, who make too much a mess, if you ask me.
An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions?
An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor.
And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.
This is life, brother. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.
This is life, sister. The struggle is what reminds us to draw breath.
Politics are something best avoided. I prefer more personal confrontations, myself.
None of our business. There's no honor to be had in the squabbling of jarls.
Kodlak says not to worry about it. I worry that a bunch of snowberries are out there earning glory while we stay out of it.
But I'll follow the old man's lead. As ever.
Too confusing for me. Empire, Nords, Talos. Who cares?
Just tell me who needs bludgeoning.
There are always good reasons to fight. I just wish this war had them.
you're wanting a good reason to fight
Soon enough, it'll be me. In the meanwhile, the Circle handles our daily routine, and Kodlak advises them as Harbinger.
You don't just waddle in here and get to speak to the boss. Who do you think you are?
If you want to embarrass yourself, I won't stop you. Kodlak is the Harbinger. He's the closest thing you'll find to a leader around here.
The Circle are the ones who parcel out the jobs.
That's Aela, Skjor, and the brothers, Farkas and Vilkas.
Kodlak advises them, but he doesn't really give orders.
In charge of what? I'm in charge of me, and you're in charge of you.
If you're looking to join up, Kodlak's the one to be talking to.
I learned the ways of the blade in the Great War. Nearly lost my life outside the Imperial City.
I came home to Skyrim when it was all over. But I wasn't much good at anything other than fighting.
Wandered around as a blade for hire. Was a damned good one, too.
The money was good, and the women were good, and the drinks were good. But I was losing myself. My heart.
I was lucky the Companions found me. Now there's a reason to be fighting. The honor of my brothers and sisters is worth more than coin.
Of course, the money is still good. And the drinks!
My mother was a Companion. And her mother. And all the women in my family, back to Hrotti Blackblade.
I stayed with my father in the woods until I was old enough for my Trial. We hunted everything there was to hunt.
Good training.
Ma didn't live long enough to see me join, but I fight to honor her and all my Shield-Sisters through time.
Vilkas and I have been here since we were little whelps.
Our father, Jergen, raised us here.
Even Vignar couldn't remember Companions younger than us!
To hear Farkas tell it, our father raised us here as happy pups, running around biting knees.
I love my brother, but his brains are not his strong suit.
We were brought here by Jergen. Whether he was our father or not, I don't care.
He left to fight in the Great War and never came back. So he's not my problem anymore.
We've been here as long as either of us can remember, though. So try to show some respect.
Like most of our band, I found this family after losing my own.
I traveled the length and breadth of this land, learning all I could of the sword and the axe.
I was just a boy, but I had the fire of a man in my heart. Eventually, my body caught up to my spirit.
My predecessor, Askar, found me in Hammerfell. I was serving as bodyguard for some weak-necked lord out there.
He brought me back here, and I realized... that I was actually coming home.
I work to bring honor to this family, and to the family that I lost. For my mother, my father, and my grandfather. For all my Shield-Siblings.
[QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] is ever-so-slightly sarcastic
So I wouldn't have to answer stupid questions from idiots.
Are you kidding? I've wanted to be with them since I was a little girl.
Haven't you heard the stories of Kodlak and Skjor fighting off the hundred-and-one Orc berserkers?
Skjor says it was more like forty, but he's just being modest.
Where else would I want to be but here? Learning from them, fighting at their sides.
A man of my station has many debts. I'm not much use at labor or learning, but I can throw a punch with the best of 'em.
The Companions let me fight for gold, and so I fight.
When you get to be my age, you don't remember why you did much of anything.
Only that it happened.
Oh, I'm not a Companion, myself. I just help Vignar. He took me in when I was having a tough time, and... well, I owe him.
Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, boy.
Family and honor. That's what it means to be one of us, girl.
How did you... you reach beyond your station, new blood. Let's wait and see how we judge your Trial before speaking further.
You shouldn't even know about that. Remember you're not a full Companion yet, whelp. Know your place.
What did I tell you? Keep quiet about that.
I think there are some things that... oh, wait. Are you trying to trick me? You are not a full-blood yet. We can't talk about that.
We should not be talking about that.
you definitely know what he's talking about. this is a thinly-veiled thread.
I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken.
Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully.
For me, a heavy burden.
The beastblood has given me prowess, but my soul is now forfeit to Hircine upon my death.
I keep searching for some hope of Sovngarde, but to no avail.
A sensitive question. You may want to be careful broaching that subject with some.
The old man and I have our differences when it comes to this. It's a blessing, given by Hircine.
To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now.
What do I care about Sovngarde? Give me the power to tear my foes as a beast of the wild, and I will savor it.
I was raised in the woods. Hunting every animal I could see, with my father. I know them all as well as I know my own mind.
And when I feel myself filling with the blood of the wolf... it's like I'm bringing all the strength of all the beasts inside me.
But my mind and soul remain my own. I become more than either human or beast.
It's like being born. Every time.
I've enjoyed the boons that come with beastblood. Just like every member of the Circle.
Kodlak is right, though. We've given a piece of our souls for this power. I know my mythic histories. Bargains like that lead to ruin.
This is a curse that was laid upon us. That much is clear.
I like being stronger when I become the wolf. But Kodlak says it is bad for the soul, and I trust him.
It means living such that your Shield-Siblings would proudly say they fought at your side.
Glory in battle, honor in life.
Deal with problems head on. Leave whispers and sneaking to the gutter rats who can't fight for themselves.
I wish more of our ranks asked such questions.
I've started seeing the Companions as a kind of family.
I've battled next to every man and woman here, and the bonds of sweat are stronger than those of blood.
I would trust anyone here with my life, which is more than I'd say for the milk drinkers who raised me.
It means resting your haunches in Whiterun more than I'd care to, for one.
But when it's time to draw blood, there's no one in Skyrim I'd rather have at my back.
It means waking up every day knowing that you could die, and having to earn your life by clawing for every breath.
I don't know how those cozy lords manage to drag themselves out of bed every day. Why bother if you're not living?
I've never been a smart one. But the Companions welcome anyone with the heart of a warrior.
When we step into battle, we fight for our own name, and the name of the Companions.
There's been a group called the Companions for over 4000 years. It's been many different things in that time.
A conquering army. Ruthless mercenaries. A band of drunken louts. And the esteemed company you see before you.
But there's always been a kind of honor to it. We don't deal in politics or underhanded sneaking.
We try to uphold the legacy of Ysgramor. To bear his good name such that it never be forgotten, and always be spoken with reverence.
It means signing on for the Nord ideas of how to live your life. Honor, battle, glory, all that.
[QUOTE]Even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord,[QUOTE] Skjor said when I joined. I think he meant it as a compliment.
To me, it means not having to answer foolish questions a second time.
Just because you've been accepted here so quickly, don't think I'm going to help you rise any faster.
Fight well, don't be a lout, and you'll be fine. You don't need my help.
So much.
This group... this family... this band... this is the best thing I've ever been a part of.
The oldest fighting group in Skyrim, and nothing but glory from Ysgramor's day to our own.
To be counted in that line is a bit of immortality. Even if I never see Sovngarde, I'll have that much.
It means when I have troubles, I always have someone on my side.
We have Shield-Siblings to keep our backs as dangerous as our fronts.
I think.
My advice? Don't overthink it. Fight well and the rest takes care of itself.
Mostly food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time.
The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning.
Well, it's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food.
Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll.
Really? That would be kind of you.
Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done.
Maybe I'll hold off and go another day. Get some rest first.
Quite a climb, wasn't it?
Anyway, much appreciated. Here, take this for your troubles.
Well, there's the occasional wolf pack or stray, but that's all I've ever had to deal with. Shouldn't be a problem for the likes of you.
Other than that, watch your footing. In these wintry conditions, the stairs can be treacherous.
Keep your eyes open in the barrow... that's how they get you!
If you're headed up to the monastery, watch your step... it's a long way down.
If you pass through again, stop by for a drink.
A pleasant journey, milord.

Just get out of town as fast as you can. Nothing for anyone here.

If you get a chance, kill a few more bears for me, will you?
Now go give those stupid bears what's coming to them!
Just get out of my way, I've got work to do.
Have yourself a great day!
Nah, not so much. The odd traveler on the road. But mostly just old Fultheim, come to drink away a lifetime of bad memories, I'd wager.
Course there's the Orc. Long-term tenant, that one. For what he pays, I could afford to shut this place down.
This old place? Been here forever. Built by my great grandda. Run by him, then all the way up the line to me.
Him? Oh... Ah, name's Balablob or Malaclob, one of them funny Orc names. Talks real good, though. Not a savage at all.
Said he's a writer. Don't know what kind of job that is, but it must earn him some pretty coin. He's paid up for the next few months.
He mostly just hangs about. Goes down to the lake, sometimes samples the stores of wine in the cellar. Man can do whatever he pleases, far as I care.
Anything you need, just holler.
Sure, walk away. I wasn't talking or anything...
You see any other inns around here? Where else would I go to drink?
Well he don't like company, I can tell you that much. Just wants to be left alone. But no... that's not really it.
It's like... he wants to talk. Likes people and all. But he stays separate, because he's supposed to.
Kind of sad, really.

Wait. Are you... Are you serious?
You have an Elder Scroll? You?

Thank you. Please, take this. It can't quite compare to an Elder Scroll, but still. You will be remembered for generations for this.
We have been on our own for some time now. I fear we will not survive.
You do not know of Malacath? He is the keeper of oaths, the master of curses.
You are an Orc, but do not know of Malacath, our master and yours?
He is quick to anger, and slow to forgive. One who wrongs Malacath is one who will endure great torment in return.
He demands loyalty and strength from his orcs. We have tried to please him, but he is now angry with us, and so we suffer.
Weeks? Longer? It feels like an age has gone by. I haven't slept in so long.
Malacath has heard my pleas! He speaks to us!
There ain't much more to tell... they're haunted and you should stay away.
Look, I've seen one of the spirits with my very own eyes. When it glared at me, I swear it burned right through my soul.
Fortunately, they seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it.
Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?
If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest.
Don't blame you one bit.

I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it.
We never saw him again.
...I can't believe this...

It was all just a fabrication of this Wyndelius character? I can't believe we were so stupid.
Well, least I can do is give you something for taking care of him. If you won't accept it as a payment, consider it a gift.

He's harmless. He's been in a state ever since his sister Reyda disappeared over a year ago.
He just keeps to himself in what's left of his folk's farmhouse across the river.
I just said that to make the poor guy feel better. I'm pretty sure she's dead.
Reyda would gather ingredients from the small island in the river east of here. Then one day, she just vanished.
I tried to look for her, but she never turned up.
I've seen some sort of a cave entrance over there. Folks call it [QUOTE]Geirmund's Hall,[QUOTE] but I don't know why.
Probably best if you avoid it for now... it didn't seem to do Reyda any good.
Are you kidding? Those damn things will drive me right out of business!
Tell you what. Bring me ten of their pelts from anywhere in Skyrim I'll gladly pay you for thinning out the herd.
Nice to finally meet someone who can follow simple instructions.
Here's your reward, as promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
Have you ever seen what a bear does to the trees? They jump up on their hind legs and scratch them to bits... marking their territory or something.
It's getting to the point where I have to scour Skyrim for untouched trees at the right size. Costs me too much time and money.
taken aback
By Talos, the stones on this one! You're in no position to dictate terms to us, Tullius!
Ulfric, you can't be taking this demand seriously? We can hold Riften against anything the Empire can throw at it.
Besides, Jarl Laila will never agree to...
Yes, my lord.
Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin.
I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...

Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere.
Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.
You are weak. Sooner you realize it, the sooner we can see the back of you.
mildly
Hmm? Oh, sorry. My mind wanders sometimes. I was just thinking about Finn's Lute.
Over a year ago, thieves broke into the college and made off with a lot of valuable things. Mostly gold and silver.
But they also stole Finn's Lute. We just learned where the bandits fled to, and I very much want that lute back.
Finn was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today.
Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes.
The lute they stole is Finn's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.
It makes me sad whenever I think about it.
What? You did? Oh sweet Divines! You did!
There is no way I can pay you what this Lute is worth. But I can teach you a few tricks I've learned over the years.
That damn fool! I should ring her neck!
Larina. That fool student of mine stole my flute and sold it to some necromancer.
I just got a ransom note for it. That flute has been handed down for seventeen generations!
Well don't just stand there. Go get my flute!
That's it! Wonderful! I knew I could count on you.
I don't have any money to give you. but I can show you a few tricks I learned playing for the Winterhold wizards.
Apparently Larina told him some story about the flute being able to make the dead dance.
It's just a flute. A really old and valuable flute, but just a flute.
They found it! They actually found it!
Rjorn's drum! Nobody knows where he died, and therefore where his drum might be.
Halldir was the missing link. Rjorn entered Halldir's Cairn in secret, and presumably died there.
Now all I need to do is find someone to get it. Wait. You. You could do it. I need you to get me that drum.
You're joking, right? Rjorn? Only the most famous battle drummer of the second age. Well, famous among bards at least.
That drum has been in half a dozen famous battles. It's a priceless artifact.
Rjorn was always looking for new stories to tell. It seems he was writing a lay about Halldir when he vanished. That was the missing clue.
At last! I have searched for this drum for 20 years.
The college treasury is a bit thin right now. But I can show you some tricks I learned from my days with the army.
Bandits harass the caravans at every step, but Khajiit usually scare them off.
A few days ago, we were ambushed. A nuisance, really, but many of the marauders had quick fingers.
One of them stole my Moon Amulet, given to me by my mother when I was just a cub. It is my only memory of home in this cold land.
You are kind to offer. We believe the bandits are a part of a group headquartered here.
Be careful. I miss my amulet, but a life cannot be replaced as easily.
We are used to the cycle of gain and loss. It is no trouble.
nostalgic
If you ever need the skills of a Khajiit warrior by your side, I would be honored to travel with you.
Until then, here. This is for you, in thanks.
Now you die!
You should never have come here!
Excellent.
He's Solitude's priest of Arkay. He's the one who figured out Potema was still around. He'll help as much as he can.
I'm not really sure. Styrr thinks you have some sort of link to Potema.
I trust his judgment on this. As a priest of Arkay he's had to deal with necromancy before. Nothing as dangerous as Potema though.
Good luck. I'm counting on you.
Taking on Potema won't be easy. But you are the one to do it.
Oh, I thought that matter was handled. I think Falk is taking care of that.
Please don't interrupt the court.
Court is in session.
I'm trying to speak to the Jarl.
Not really. Varnius Junius is a fool. I'm sure nothing will come of it.
I suppose if you're truly interested you could talk to Falk. He's the better-safe-than-sorry type.
I've done my part, Dragon Bridge will have extra guards. Falk Firebeard will find a way to take care of the cave.

Oh, merciful Arkay, no! I am too old and frail, and this graveyard is too large.
Kust is my assistant. He helps me tend the headstones and keep our cemetery clean, as befits a place of rest.
Yes, and I couldn't tell you why.
My wife and I think there's some dark magic at work. Or perhaps Arkay's influence is strong here, and he likes to keep it this way.
The cemetery is ancient. It's been here longer than the town.
I'm no scholar, but I know that a lot of battles have been fought here over the course of history.
After each battle, more dead were buried, and the graveyard got bigger. I've heard it's now the biggest graveyard in Skyrim.
Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do.
Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here.
The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across Skyrim.
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several Khajiit Caravans that travel across the realm.
being coy
Actually, I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances.
Present Ri'saad with this satchel of Moon Sugar, and I bet my last septim he'll make a deal.
It's an illegal substance highly favored by the Khajiit. Very difficult to come by.
If Moon Sugar is refined properly, it can be used to make skooma, another substance that will knock you over after a single draught.
Ri'saad is the head of a small syndicate of independent merchant families.
Each caravan is obliged to pay dues, but in return a small portion of the profits are shared between them and the leader parcels out the routes.
If we could make contact with them, they could provide an excellent way to inconspicuously transport goods for us.
very wary
thinking to self, pensive
I'll consider the offer, but I'll have to discuss it with the other caravans.
Ah, Moon Sugar. I could smell it on you. I'm pleased with this offer, and accept.
Take my word to the leaders of your guild and tell them we look forward to a prosperous and profitable future.
If you happen upon any of our caravans in your travels, we'd also be more than willing to pay you a fair sum for any of your stolen goods.
Good, I'll contact some of my people and have them prepare some shipments right away.
Good job. Here, let me give you something for all the leg work.
Was there anything else, or is our transaction complete?
Did Ri'saad accept our offer?
Give my regards to Tonilia. Tell her I'll contact her soon.
You'll find Ri'saad with his caravan group. Just don't do anything stupid when you get there.
But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.
Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?
The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!
We should get after Vals Veran before he does more damage here.
I'll tell you more about it when we are nearby.
It's somewhere around here, Agna said to look to the Bear to find the way.
Thanks again for your help.
I have things I should see to, but go ahead.
I feel better already.

What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?
You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text.
Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.
Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.
Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.

Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.
Farengar!
Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby.
You should come, too.
A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?

Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor.

If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me.
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.
Crossing the Guild was a bad idea. I'll buy goods from you after you settle your accounts.
Ah, you're just in time. I got in a shipment of fine wares courtesy of the East Empire Company.
Come to sell me something special, or did you just want to look through my merchandise?
Ah, you're back. I'm hearing good things about the Guild through the grapevine.
Brought me more than some Firebrand Wine I trust?
I heard about what you did at the Guild all the way out here. Sorry, can't buy or sell anything from you.
Been a while since I've seen you at the meadery. Bring me anything interesting?
What brings you to Whiterun? Got some juicy goods to sell?
sarcastic/coy
I've got plenty of good merchandise for you. Take a look.
Rumor has it you couldn't follow the Guild's rules, so we can't do any business until it's been worked out.
Taking me up on my offer, eh? Good.
I'm assuming you're here for more than a social call. Down to business, eh?
I'm always on the lookout for all sorts of goods. Bring me whatever you... well, [QUOTE]find[QUOTE] and I'll see what I can do.
So, did Delvin send you again or you here on your own this time?
In trouble with the Guild, eh? Well, looks like we won't be trading merchandise until you smooth it over.
So, you've come to see me to sell or to buy? Hm?
I've got all sorts of interesting things for you to buy, and I assure you they're of the finest quality.
If you've got the time to sell, I've got the time to buy.
Let's see what you have for me today. Something simple to turn around for a profit I trust.
I've been forbidden to deal with you until amends are made with the Guild. Sorry.
Glad your here, I've been looking for some more merchandise to buy. Have lots of orders to fill and my clients don't like to wait.
Now I know you've come by for more than just a visit. What did you bring?
I promise you, I buy much more than simple silver trinkets.
I've made a lot of new contacts thanks to you, and more contacts means more coin for everyone.
Just remember me if you get your hands on anything else.
Do me a favor. If you speak to Maven, tell her everything's well at hand down here, okay?
Give my regards to Karliah if you see her.
Hurry back... and bring more merchandise.
When you get back to Riften, tell Delvin this new arrangement's working out quite well.
Working with the Guild again is the best decision I've ever made. Protection, respect and a constant flow of coin... it couldn't get any better.
Best of all, there's no need to smuggle things quietly anymore. With the influence we have in Solitude, I can march it right out the front door.
How could I complain when I went from Sabjorn's lackey to one of the wealthiest merchants in Whiterun in no time at all?
Plus, the meadery's doing so well, I'm almost having trouble keeping up with the demand.
I'd say things couldn't be any better.
Business? Business is actually inconsequential to me. I share little of your lust for coin.
However, as promised, I'll still be more than happy to take any stolen merchandise off your hands.
I've been setting up some open trading with Tonilia back at the Guild in Riften, and it's proven to be quite profitable.
There's been no word from the remnants of the Summerset Shadows, so I'm assuming you either eliminated all of them or they've fled Skyrim.
Everything seems to be working out nicely, wouldn't you agree?
Business is absolutely booming, my friend.
I've taken to hiring a few extra men of my own just to keep up with all the shipments.
Old Delvin certainly takes care of his own, doesn't he.

You just sit tight. I'll get around to it eventually.

Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.
And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.

Turns out, we fatally underestimated the Thalmor. They smashed us with ease during the Great War.
I was one of the few who escaped. For a long time, all I cared about was staying alive, and taking revenge on the Thalmor when I could.
But then the dragons returned. And I remembered that the Blades used to be dragonslayers.
And that we were sworn to protect the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer of all.
You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it.

Elsweyr is an arid land of deserts and rocky canyons, where the sun shines warmly, always.
There are cities so ancient, the sands have swallowed them whole. But now I will say no more, for I miss my home greatly.
An astute question, for we are far from home and this is a cold, hard land.
The wise trader finds the best opportunities, even if he must travel far to find them. Skyrim is a ripe opportunity indeed.
Crafty, cunning
Mostly it is the Nords. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities.
When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and skooma dealers. It is most unfair, but we do our best to ignore them.
Not long, in truth. I came to Skyrim after I found myself unwelcome in both Elsweyr and Cyrodiil.
I seem to have an unfortunate talent for getting myself involved in misunderstandings with the law.
Ri'saad was able to look past that, and it was he who helped to set me up with a trade caravan. Now I work for him.
He hired the others and paid for my goods. I am allowed to run the caravan, but I pay Ri'saad a percentage of my profits.
I say this without bitterness, for it was Ri'saad who saved me from a life of servitude aboard a trading ship.
I am grateful to have the life that I do now. It is a far cry from my days as an orphan on the streets of Corinthe.
It is Ri'saad who owns the three trading caravans that travel the roads of Skyrim.
Long ago, I was an orphan on the streets of Corinthe. I stowed away aboard a trade ship that brought me here. It was Ri'saad who found me.
He provided the funds to start this caravan, and put me in charge of it. I owe him more than I could ever hope to repay.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means.
It was Ri'saad's idea to come here now, while the land is in turmoil. Where others saw only danger, he saw opportunity.

Here's something to consider, Mirabelle.
[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], by Dranor Seleth. Old book, one I'd forgotten about. This thing here... it might be what the book was about.
I don't see the relevance.
He proposed that the real reason Saarthal was fought over by the Elves and the Nords was because something was unearthed there.
Something arcane. Very old, very powerful. Do you think...?
Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll do all the research we need to figure out what we're dealing with.
Tell me, do you believe in mighty Arkay, god of life and death?
There's one out on the road. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company.
It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.
Ha! You've done it! Got to admit, I wasn't sure you could pull it off. But you've definitely earned your pay.
Let's make the exchange.
I see you but I don't see Frost. Come back when you have the horse with you.
Yes, yes. Here it is. I think I'd best be off now.
People say there's a man wandering the streets near the Blue Palace. He seems distressed but he's not making any sense.
Varnius Junius stopped by here on his way to court. He was worried about something. I'm sure Falk Firebeard could tell you what.
I think the Bards College might be looking for recruits. You should speak to the head of the college, Viarmo, if you're interested.
Ah, yes! There it is! Thank you so much.
Done. Convince him to stay out of the city while you're at it.
Takes coin to pay a fine. And you don't have enough.
just heard an awful sound in the distance (it's a dragon roar, but you don't know that)

this horrifies you
He even stole that locket right off that poor murdered girl's body... or what was left of it.
I'm sorry I mislead you. Return when this is over, and we'll talk about my involvement in the Thieves Guild.
I don't know. Rumor has it that she was murdered... butchered by a madman. I really try and stay out of such things.
Torsten might think Linwe or myself are responsible for Fjotli's death, but I can assure you nothing could be further from the truth.
coming out of a daze
obnoxious
Fjotli...  Fjotli... Where have I heard that name?
Oh, of course, the poor girl who was murdered. Such a beautiful young thing... a tragedy to be certain.
You're accusing me of taking part such a... such a... heinous act? I should have you arrested for even suggesting such a thing!
suddenly pleasant
I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.
Now you're threatening me? What in the name of the Divines is wrong with you?
about to attack
Next time you wish to accuse someone of a crime, I suggest you obtain proof!
Look, I had no choice. They're crazy... I could be killed!
It's a guild of Altmer thieves, they call themselves the Summerset Shadows.
Their leader, Linwe, he's the worst of the lot. He steals valuables from the dead.
I used to fence for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim a long time ago.
When Linwe moved into the area, he contacted me and said if I didn't fence for them, he'd kill me.
If I tell you, you need to promise not to kill me.
I'd prove to be quite an asset to the Thieves Guild... I'm one of the best fences in Skyrim.
Linwe is holed up at a place called Uttering Hills Cave. He's got his entire Guild there, so be careful.
After you're done with all this, come back anytime, and I'll make good on my end of the bargain.
What do you want now? You still hurling baseless accusations?
I've already told you everything I know, I swear.
You're making a Grim joke. Roggvir is about to be executed.
Wish I could head inside Solitude myself. Wouldn't mind seeing Roggvir get what's coming to him.
Hmmmm... [QUOTE]Fixed[QUOTE] is such a subjective term. I think [QUOTE]treated[QUOTE] is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face.

So congratulations! You're free to go!
I... have been known to change my mind. So... go. Really.
Oh... lovely. Now all my dear Pelagius has to worry about are the several hundred legitimate threats...
But you're not out of the woods yet! Get it? Out of the woods?
Ah, wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!
But someone still has quite a bit to do. Hmmm?
Ah! Good, good! No more barking at all hours, and chewing up my slippers. You used the hemlock, then? Damned good idea! I...
Um... We're not talking about Barbas, are we? Clavicus Vile's... dog? Oohh... awkward.
Oh! That's right! Pelagius! Yes, yes, now I recall. Well done, well done.
Now keep going.
Mortal? Insufferable.

Well! Same congratulations apply! Just, you know, for what you did for the insane emperor.
Conquering paranoia should be a snap after that ordeal, hmm?
The Gildergreen, yes. It's a bit of an eyesore at the moment. More of a problem for the pilgrims than for me, but not many of them around anymore.
This is the Temple of Kynareth. The Gildergreen, outside, was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches.
Of course, not as many pilgrims these days.
This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun.
Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. They built the temple.
A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains.
Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.
I've thought about that... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber.
I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, we could wake up its child.
But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal.
If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.
You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Spriggans.
It's called [QUOTE]Nettlebane.[QUOTE] The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself.
Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic.
Your spirit is strong. Kynareth's winds will guide your path.
It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock.
slightly detached; reverent
The sap is precious. It can restore barren fields or bring life to rocks. I can use it to repair the Gildergreen, so we can worship properly again.
You're right. It's mine.
I may not live to see this little one grow into a new Gildergreen, but I can be remembered as the woman who planted it.
I thank you. And may Kynareth's soft rains fall before you.
The Eldergleam has blessed us with a sapling.
You should take it to Whiterun. Danica will want to see that the true blessings of nature lie in renewal, not a slavish maintenance.
I believe I'll stay here and bask in Eldergleam's warmth a bit longer.
It was my pleasure, friend. In a way, I envy you getting to carry such a direct sign of Kynareth's graces.
Good luck on your travels. May Kynareth's wind carry only the sweetest scents.
dragon roar in the distance, shouting in challenge
Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal.
But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?
I'm sorry, but I can't do it. We'll just have to keep fighting the dragons as best we can.
There must be another way. The risk is too great.
You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack.
By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.
testily
True. A pause to consolidate our gains would be useful. And the Empire can afford to look magnanimous in victory.
Ulfric's insurrection has reached its high tide. Soon enough the rebel Jarls will realize what it means to oppose the Empire.
But, as you say, these negotiations may offer a chance for his supporters to gracefully return to the Imperial fold.
mulling the situation to himself
They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons.
My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons.
with an unkind smile
Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.
Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true... well, it changes the situation doesn't it?
Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.
incredulously
And if it isn't true... well, then the fight to free Skyrim goes on. Either way, I don't see the use in talking to the Empire.
You speak truly, Dragonborn. Sometimes the grubby business of politics clouds my eyes.
Besides, it will be good to see High Hrothgar again.
with a flash of anger at the player's impertinence
with grudging admiration for the player's political skills
I'm not sure. At first they accused me of being a Stormcloak, a secret Talos worshipper...
They wanted a confession. To what didn't matter, they simply wanted me to admit to something.
I think they wanted to break me. Use me as a way to get to the rest of the Gray-Mane family.
I gave them no such pleasure.
Gods, I've lost count of the days. It feels like an age has passed.
I wish I could believe that I'd have held out forever against their torture, but I can't be so sure.
Now thanks to you I needn't worry anymore.

By Ysmir, are you thick, or just too new to know better?
The Companions are the oldest, most honored band of warriors in Skyrim. Whiterun was built around their hall, Jorrvaskr.
emphasis on [QUOTE]you[QUOTE]
By Ysmir's beard, I ain't one for humor. You know who the Companions are. So quit your asking.
Great! I'll unlock the door and meet you inside, then you can lead the way.
Whatever I can to put my family here back to rest.
After that? Probably just stick around here. Saw some good game on my way here, and I'd like to stay close for a while.
Initially frightened, then relieved
Just one more thing the Gray-Manes want to blame on others.
It's not my fault they turned their backs on the Empire, or their mule of a son raised arms against it.
And yet they want to heap the fault on my family's good name? Bah.
More bad blood between the houses. Fralia is convinced our family is somehow at fault for the loss of her son.
There's no reasoning with these people anymore.
No, nor do I expect to. Would be too dangerous for now.
It's enough for me to know that he's out there somewhere, and not locked up like an animal in a cage.
It's enough for me to know that they're out there somewhere, and together again.
Haven't you heard it by now?
He made the mistake of supporting the Stormcloaks, and it cost him. Bitter news for his family, but a fate they should've expected.
Here's the letter. Now leave me out of this.
We've got to find Thorald quickly!
Get to the nearest way out!
I can't believe you came for me!
laughing
I've got a little work if you're interested, traveler.
You should see me when you get bored, stranger.
The Blackblood Marauders are... very identifiable. I didn't want anyone thinking the Blackbloods were getting too bold.
Deeja and I are more like their representatives here in Solitude. None of the Blackbloods can show themselves without being arrested.
Th...thank you, my Jarl thank you.
Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?
Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell Captain Aldis I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge.
Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave...
I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed.
You've done a larger service to the realm than you could possibly know. A resurrected Potema... I shudder at the thought.
Then I have an important task for you.
grim/serious
Aye. A gift from the Black-Briars after they kicked the previous family out... place called Riftweald Manor.
He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place.
Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.
Get on with it.

You wouldn't have a few minutes to run down to the docks would you?
Great. Get back to me when you're done and I'll give you something for your time.
Ah well. I'll keep looking for someone. Thanks anyway.
Ah yes. If she wants to pay the two thousand gold tariff than we'll be all set.
You will?
I mean of course you will. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
I suppose I could make an exception. I do like her spiced wine.
Fine, tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
That's not my problem.
That would be acceptable. You can tell Evette San her shipment will be brought up to Solitude shortly.
I'm afraid your bargaining without the metal to back it up.
Thank you so much. I swear it's a fight with them every shipment. Here's something for your troubles.
Those who worship at the shrines will sometimes receive boons from the gods themselves.
The nature of the favors varies per deity. Please, feel free to worship at any or all of the shrines.
Hmm? Ah, yes. That once held the shrine to Talos. But the worship of Talos was banned by the White-Gold Concordat, some time ago.
It's the peace treaty that ended the war with the Elves of the Aldmeri Dominion.
The Dominion recognized the heresy of proclaiming Talos a god. Talos was a great man, and a great Emperor... but that does not make him a god.
No matter how much the Stormcloaks may wish it were so.
Most people head over to the Winking Skeever.
If you're not interested in music or drink, you can at least talk to Corpulus. He can fill you in on any of the latest gossip.
Go ahead, Ataf.
I believe I've made myself rather clear.
Yes of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.
You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here.
You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity.
oily, insincere
Very good. Then we're done here.
Your superior and I were simply having a... discussion about my level of access to the College.
snotty
Nothing you need to concern yourself with. I shall be quite capable of observing everything that goes on here.
I still don't see why we had to bring it back here.
The Arch-Mage believed it important. It must be powerful.
We don't know that. We don't even know what it is. Where is Aren, anyway?
In his quarters, with that Thalmor, Ancano. Something urgent, it sounded like.
All right, that's enough. Let's return to our business please.
All right, that's enough. Back to bed, please.
Of course, leave an old man with a ruined dream. Just like everyone else. Fool.
The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was... desecrated. The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present.
So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see.
Such was my... honor. As Keeper.
What? Who is the Night Mother?
Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero!
You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis.
sinister
Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.
Hmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things.
He is... the Void.

A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed.
Legend has it that the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is said to increase the power of the wearer.
Whatever the truth, if Ulfric get's his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around which to rally support for his cause.
Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns.
Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession.
But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas.
I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there... he's likely found it.

But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.

It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains...

But I began to search for information about dragons - where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?
You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh?
An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself.
Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here.
I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.
Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources... reliable sources.
I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth.
But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us.
Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim.
Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons.
The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.
Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times.
Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name - Dragonsreach.
Farengar, I see you've already met my new friend here.
I'm sure you two will get along famously.
Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project.

This is a priority now. Anything we can use to fight this dragon, or dragons. We need it, quickly. Before it's too late.
Of course, Jarl Balgruuf. You seem to have found me an able assistant.

By Ysmir, Irileth was right!
You'd better speak to the Jarl, then.
Oh, yes? We'll get to that, after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.
You were at Helgen when it was attacked? You saw this with your own eyes?
Perhaps some more Glow Dust in the next batch of potions. That should increase their resistance.
No, but that won't account for the size issue. Blast, if only so many of these creatures hadn't escaped.
to self aloud
Look, this is really simple. I lent him some gold, he promised to pay me back and now he says he's broke. End of story.
All right, all right. I guess I made enough from his shipment. No need to waste any more time threatening a stable hand.
Tell Shadr he doesn't owe me anything.
I don't care, a deal's a deal.
Don't know why you'd help a stranger like that, but a septim's a septim... don't care where it comes from.
You can tell Shadr his debt's been paid.
You don't have enough gold to pay it off, and I'm not cutting any deals.
All right, all right! Take it easy. No idea why you'd care about a stranger so much, but this isn't worth a fight.
Tell Shadr I'm forgetting about his debt.
sarcastic/angry amusement
You can go back and forth all you want, he just needs to pay.
Back off, this action's all mine. No room for anyone else in the Guild on this one.
Why should I bother? I've already made a bunch of coin off of his shipment, so anything else I squeeze out of him would be a bonus.
Oh... wait a second. I see what this is. You want me to cut you in or you'll rat me out to Brynjolf.
scheming
Now you're talking.
Oh, if you see Shadr, remind him he still owes me that debt.
Woah, woah. Calm down. Let's just think about this for a moment.
Sigh. You win. Tell Shadr he can forget the debt.
Oh, you heard about that, huh? Uh, sorry boss. I was going to speak to Delvin about cutting the Guild in, but I forgot.
You aren't angry about it, right?
I got the message. Consider it forgotten, boss.
extremely dejected
By the Eight! You actually talked her into it?
I don't know what to say. I didn't think anyone in Riften even cared what happened to me.
Look, I was saving this, but I wanted you to have it. I thought I might need it if Sapphire came for me, but I don't need it anymore.
Hey, I cut you into the deal. There's nothing else to discuss.
Look, I already said Shadr doesn't owe me a thing, so get off my back.
Yeah? What's your problem?
hopeful
Huh? What do you want?

Be careful with Sapphire. She's mixes with all sorts of nasty people.

Well, as I said, Arkay is the god of life and death. You'll find his temples and Halls of the Dead all across Tamriel.
Priests of Arkay such as myself perform rites for the dead and sometimes console the bereaved.
We also keep a constant vigil against those who practice the vile arts of necromancy.
I asked the question because I was hoping you might be able to help me recover something I've lost.

Honestly, the Legion can use all the able bodies it can muster. We have our hands full. A dead king, a rebellion, and now dragons? Skyrim's a mess.

Go on in.
Very droll, almost bored.
Don't cause any trouble in the city.
You're clear to enter.
Move along.
Windhelm is one of the oldest human cities in all of Tamriel. In fact, it was the capital of the First Empire, which was founded by Ysgramor
The Palace of the Kings in which you now stand is one of the last buildings that remain from that era.
Long ago, the Empire used the city to garrison troops who guarded the passes to Morrowind.
And now, thanks to you, the city is back under the Empire's banner.
Well, a few reasons come to mind.
In my days as a riverboat captain, I was known to run a tight ship.
That, and I made my fortune by knowing when to spend my septims, and when not to. I can't stand waste.
I wish I could say that it was, but it's not that simple.
Many Stormcloaks will fight until they die, because they still believe they're fighting for Skyrim's freedom.
But without Ulfric, the movement will wither and die. It's only a matter of time.
snarky
I'm supposed to allow you to trade in one of your pieces of Guild armor, so what will it be?
Your new piece will enhance your skill beyond that of the original. Trust me.
Are you sure? Once I exchange it for you, I'm not taking it back... unless you want to sell it at a discount of course.
Make up your mind already.
Okay, there you go.
Tough luck for you then. Come back when you have at least one of the pieces.
Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you.
I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck.
You'll see! It was a dragon! It'll kill us all and then you'll believe me!
Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man, perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times.
So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though.
I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him?
But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.
Of course. Skyrim has always been part of the Empire.
That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends.
Ah, I forget you're new to Skyrim. Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torryg when he was murdered.
Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories.
That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.
What would you have me do, then? Nothing?
My lord. Please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more information before we act.
My lord. Please. You have to listen.
I only counsel caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.
If the news from Helgen is true... well, there's no telling what it means.
Who's this, then?
I just...
suspiciously
Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally.
still suspicious
You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.
Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me.
I'm starting to think...
It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say.
It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what she has to say.
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her?

And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why he left you.
Gods, what a mess.
Shocked, suddently afraid-- discovering a bunch of dead bodies.
Well, you could always speak to Delvin or Vex if you're looking for extra work.
Or if you're looking for training, we've got plenty of it down here. Delvin, Vex, Niruin and Vipir can give you a leg up on that.
If you're lookin' to get some coin for the fruits of your labor, you should talk to Tonilia. She sounds tough, but she'll cut you a fair deal.
I also suggest you spend some time in the trainin' room. Just talk to Vipir. He'll show you around.
If you're ever in need of some quick coin for items you find on the job, Tonilia is the best fence around.
And besides myself, Delvin, Niruin and Vipir can help you with any sort of training you might need to sharpen your skills.
I'll point you to the first and last person you're ever going to need to talk to. Tonilia. She's the Guild's fence.
Treat her right and she'll make you rich. Try and rip her off and you'll have the whole Guild to answer to.
If talking your way out of trouble isn't enough, you could always pick up some training from Delvin, Vex or Vipir.
Also, I recommend hitting the training room if you need lockpick practice. Helped me out of a jam more than once.
unimpressed
Well, looks like you and I are going to have to get very well acquainted.
I'm the fence down here. You come by anything you don't exactly own and I'll pay you some coin for it. Minus a little slice for the Guild, of course.
I can also provide a few supplies useful to our trade now and again, for a small fee.
very annoyed
At the end of the day you'll find all we care about down here is how much gold you can make us.
Good. Then there isn't much more to say.

You know who I am, fool. So why you askin'?
You blind, boy? I'm a blacksmith. Any half-wit could see that.

Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made up of three Rotmulaag - Words of Power.
You see - Paar-thur-nax - a Thu'um - a Shout, yes?
He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin.
But Odahviing, he is... headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this.
He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come.

Please do let me know if you change your mind.
Not much, I'm afraid. It was named Kahvozein's Fang after the dragon worshipped by this particular sect of the cult.
They were said to be quite fond of ritual sacrifices. So fond, in fact, that the high priest spent a great deal of time sharpening the dagger.
That way it was always ready for the next inevitable victim.
Perhaps not the brightest spot in Skyrim's history, eh?
Not just any dragon scales. Heartscales. Very special.
You'll need Kahvozein's Fang, of course.
Then, if you should happen upon the corpse of a dragon, you should be able to use it to slice off a heartscale or two.
Even just one should be enough for me to complete my research.
Wonderful, just wonderful!

Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No... they treated me like garbage, threw me away.

Never been to Whiterun before? The Jarl's palace is something to see. Dragonsreach they call it. Big old dragon skull hanging on the wall.
First time to Solitude? Beautiful old city. Capital of Skyrim, but I'm sure you already knew that.
Ever been to Markarth? Some say it was built by the dwarves. I don't believe a word of it though.
If you've never been to Riften, be sure to visit the Black-Briar meadery. A few mugs of that and you'll forget all about the long trip.
Ever been to Windhelm? Oldest city in Skyrim, by some accounts. They say the big old palace there was built by Ysgramor himself.
Solitude's famous for it's Bards College. Worth a visit if you've never been. Some of them can sing just as pretty as a lark.
Solitude's a big port town, you know? Full of sailors and their tales of far away lands. Most of 'em's foreigners and liars, of course.
You'll want to watch out for the Forsworn if you do any travelling around the Reach. Bloodthirsty bastards, them.
If you don't mind a piece of advice, I'd stay out of trouble in Markarth. They'll toss you in the Cidhna Mine, and you'll never get out.
When I'm in Whiterun, I always visit the Gildergreen. Never hurts to pay your respects to Lady Kynareth, particularly in my line of work.
You'll want to watch yourself in Riften. A lot of ways to get yourself in trouble in that town.
I might have to stop and get myself a pint of Black-Briar mead while I'm in Riften. Almost worth the trip all by itself.
You might run into some of them lizard-folk in Riften. Quite a few of them work the docks there, not sure why. Like swimming in the lake, maybe.
Windhelm's a bit cold for my tastes. And I ain't talking about the weather. You're not from Windhelm, are you?
You'll find Windhelm's full of dark elves. The kind from Morrowind, you know. Not that I have anything against them, long as they keep to themselves.

Why is it always raining?
This rain will stop eventually. Always does.
Hope you're not getting too wet back there.
Better bundle up. This may keep up for a while.
A little snow never stopped me, don't worry.

Let me just take this coin purse off your hands for you. And those nice boots you've got there.
Now you just stay here, with all your friends, and I'm going to go get my shovel.

Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The security plan will then fail.
Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled.
He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim.
Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis.
Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest.
Oh, and one final thing...

If you have need of hunting supplies then you've come to the right place.
We've got arms and armor of all kinds.
You look like someone who knows how to wield a weapon. Well, you've come to the right place.
If it's armor you need, we've got all kinds, both light and heavy.
Proud.
Polite, but a little pushy. You're a salesman.
Polite, friendly
Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion.
You must be a Stormcloak through and through to request that one.
Only true Imperials request that one.
Ahhh, a fine but bloody tale. I can do that one.
Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it.
slightly irritated
So. You were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes?
What's this about Riverwood being in danger?
Well. I trust you have something vitally important to tell me. Important enough to interrupt me in the middle of council?

Barking orders
I don't care... We're going all the way in. I want to know what Shalidor hid in here.
You want to stay here, fine. But the rest of us aren't giving up now.
No, no. You just stay here and rest.
We'll come back for you as soon as we've reached our goal. You have my word.
Once again you have come seeking something.
The circumstances differ. This time I have what you seek.
Are you prepared?
The trial awaits. Are you now prepared?
Colette has already told you. You must be tested before knowledge can be imparted to you.
Arrogance will serve you poorly. Your worth must be determined before knowledge can be bestowed upon you.
And so you shall be tested.
You will rely on your skill as a mage. Not on your belongings, not on your scrolls and potions. Only what lies within.
Survive, and you are worthy. This is the test put before you. Will you accept?
Step into the light, and your test begins.
Knowledge is power. Knowing spells can be powerful, but applying that knowledge is key.
You will be called upon to rely solely on your Restoration spells.
You are not worthy!
At this very moment? No. However...
Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell.
I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.
I need dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
I need you to collect some dragon scales. And not just any dragon scales.
As I've said, I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough.
My knowledge of Skyrim's history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
First, there are ancient references to dragon [QUOTE]heartscales[QUOTE]. What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need.
Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve individual scales off a dragon.
First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few scales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.
What's happened? Did you find a way to learn the Dragonrend Shout?
Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?
Esbern should be able to help. He's spent his whole life poring over every old book he could find about dragons and that prophecy.
you're alluding to Paarthurnax - that you're going to ask the player to kill him in a minute
I don't have time for your foolishness. Either help me or be gone.
He must be here somewhere...
Ah, a secret admirer, eh? Don't worry, I won't tell a soul.
Calcelmo? Is he interested in Faleen? That sly old codger. I should have guessed.
Good for him. For the both of them.
you're using [QUOTE]bit of warmth[QUOTE] as a euphemism for sex
As for what she might like...
I didn't tell you this. Faleen likes to act tough, but she really has a soft spot for, of all things, poetry.
You know, I took some classes at the Bards College as a youth. Poems come in handy when wooing.
There's a poem I once used on an older lady of Rorikstead. I can change it to be about Faleen, if you've got some gold.
You should probably just take this directly to Faleen. Wouldn't want the old icebrain stumbling over the words.
You should probably just let Faleen read it herself. Don't want you stumbling over the words and ruining my flow.

Kyr's orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.

The boss went down there? Today?
Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry.
I've got a bad feeling about this... something's just felt wrong down there lately. Eerie.
Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the Pale Lady next.

You should be more careful with the men you pick, dear.
He said he loved me....
Real men prove their love. Words are as empty as the air they run through.
Stop moping about, girl. Tears won't change what you've done.
I was such a fool. How could I let him use me like that?
We all get used, dear. It's living with it that makes you a woman.
Jarl Elisif the Fair. Poor woman. Losing her husband and king like that. It was a dark day for us all.
Damn, that reminds me, I have a delivery to make to her steward, Falk Firebeard. He ordered a special bottle of Stros M'Kai Rum.
Save me a lot of trouble. Here. Take it to the Blue Palace.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh right, the rum. Thank you. I developed a taste for it after a fair weather trip to Hammerfell.
Here, this is for you.
You're part of the crowd at an execution.
Stand back. Interrupting an execution is a serious crime.
I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him.
Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore.
Jawanan, I don't see you here often.
I do not like fish.
Okay. Well. That's all I've got.
I am buying a fish for Noster. He likes fish.
A sale's a sale but I have to know... why are you buying something for Noster?
A war veteran should be respected.
Salmon sounds good today.
Speaking of sounding good, I've heard a couple of your classmates on the street recently.
As long as they're playing instruments they're passable. You don't want to hear them sing.
I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution.
I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos.
I appreciate the thought though.
Fresh fish sounds like just the thing today, Addvar.
I've been pushing the Salmon but I'll tell you the Slaughterfish is a bit better today.
Thank you, Addvar, I am picky about what I eat these days.
A little late in the day for your rounds Sorex.
I seem to have more chores for the Winking Skeever each day. I still have a delivery to do too.
You know, my father collected exotic alcohols.
Mildly curious.
Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like.
None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette.
I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted.
Thanks, Aia. That means a lot.
Glad to hear it, Aia.
Shoot the far target.
We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision.
Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot.
However, with such a long shot, it's more than likely that's the only shot you'll be able to take before your prey runs off.
If you find yourself in such a situation, then you need to make your shot count.
Don't rush your shot. Crouch down, get comfortable, and take aim.
OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count.
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have ten seconds to hit each of the four targets. Draw string and get ready.
You did it! All four targets in ten seconds. Nice job.
We've talked about composure, speed, and precision.
Now it's time to use all three at once.
I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult.
Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.
It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about.
When I tell you to, try and hit all four targets in ten seconds.
But... Eisa? She's smarter than that.
Ra'jirr was always dragging her into things.
But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?
Who knows. The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.
Winded, furious.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother.
You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Sister.
Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you.
Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr.
The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in your eyes and tell your worth.
If you go to him, good luck.
Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant.
That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.
Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort.
Glory only awaits those who triumph.
And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought.
Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane.
See what a warrior of true mettle is like.
Already did. Part of the reason I'm living out here now. Thanks for offering though.
If you need a bow, there's one on the rack to the left of the door.
You're not mad. Said with a smile and wink.
What kind of a mentor would I be if I denied a potential student a glimpse at his master's ingenuity!
Here, this key will provide access to my museum. Feel free to browse for as long as you wish.
However, I must insist that my laboratory remains strictly off limits.
Only inside the gates. Much of Falkreath hold is wilderness and there's plenty of trouble to be had.
Done. Now move along, before you get me in trouble.
Not so tough now, are you?
I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect.
One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.
taunting
They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable.
This one doesn't look too difficult.
That should do it. After you.
Quite simple really, I don't know what the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill.
Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint.
Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm certain Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own.
Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really.
Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.
I set up those targets a long time ago. I shoot at them from time to time. Don't want to get rusty with my bow.
That I am. You know how to use one?
There's a whole college up in Solitude where they teach the arts. Song. Lute-playing. Poetry.
I studied there myself. Had to leave over a misunderstanding with a headmistress. Well, more a misunderstanding with her husband.
Got stones in your ears? I asked what side you're on, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born!
Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine.
Then I say well met, friend. I could tell you were a sharp one the moment I laid eyes on you.
New in town, huh? Whiterun's got two clans, both old and both respected.
Difference is, the Gray-Manes turned their backs on the Empire and we Battle-Borns stayed loyal.
So I'll ask again, Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
Gray-Mane or Battle-Born?
Sooner or later, we all have to choose a side.
I suppose it would be better than sitting around thinking about all this.
you've just pulled yourself together from the brink of tears
I could also do some good for a change. Sure, I'd go with you.
I moved here from Helgen after my family was killed.
At the time I couldn't stand to be around anyone. They all felt sorry for me and I didn't want them to. It was my problem, not theirs.
You're not afraid of anyone.
Sorry, a girl can't be too careful out here.
Like I said, name's Angi and I've been living out here for a couple of years now.
Did you hear all that noise outside?
It's just the market rabble. We should get back to work.
You there. If you're here to trade, step up to the counter.
I'm a Dark Elf and I live in Windhelm, so yes, I live in the Gray Quarter.
You must be new around here, or you'd know they don't let my kind live anywhere outside that slum.
It was difficult at first. The Nords of this city are, at best, suspicious of outsiders.
But in time, I made the right friends and proved myself useful enough that they don't give me trouble anymore.
The dark elves are too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are, and so they continue to dwell in that slum.
They're parasites. They're living in our city, under our protection, but what do they do for us? Nothing!
I know the High King invited them here, but he didn't ask me or anyone else first. Maybe he should have.
Wouldn't surprise me. They've done nothing to help in the fight for Skyrim's freedom.
Those Thalmor are elves, too. I bet they're working together.
Maybe I should round up some men and take us a few prisoners to interrogate.
Well... maybe just this once. But there's still a price on your head. Better make yourself scarce, or we'll have to do this little dance again.
Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far.
Dovahkiin, you call yourself? Arrogant mortal.

Look at you. Such a devoted student of Restoration.
It's comforting to see that not everyone has dismissed it as entirely as most members of the College. Truly comforting.
It looks like you're ready to speak with the Augur.
Oh, didn't you know?
flattered
The Augur was a brilliant mage. Truly inspired. Mastered spells others could barely comprehend.
He was especially gifted when it came to Restoration. He's... Well, he's very particular about who shares the knowledge.
So you'll need his approval first. Go on, go talk to him. I'm sure he's been paying attention, and will be expecting you.
You are worthy. The knowledge is yours.

I also do a little herb growing. The court wizard, Wuunferth, pays us to plant a little Nightshade. Who knows what he uses it for?
Hey, could you deliver this bottle of Nightshade Extract to Wuunferth?
Thanks.
Ah yes, the extract, good. Poisonous, of course, but it has its uses.
I suppose you want something for your trouble? Here.
You've done it! You've beaten him!
And yet...
He's no longer abusing the power of the Eye. I would've expected all this to stop.

On my honor, I won't bother Carlotta ever again.
What did you just say? All I heard was the sound of jealousy.
Bold words, but true. Fine, you win. I'll pay the Argonians more coin.
They don't work now. Why should I waste more money?
All right, all right. You sound like a damn Legion officer, but I get it. I'll give him a break. This better not hurt our quota.

Fine. You sound like a priest of Mara, but I get your point. Tell him to forget about the gold.
A debt. Is a debt.
I guess you're right. A Nord shouldn't be so proud to turn down a kind soul's generosity. Tell Iddra I'll be fine.
No. I have my pride.
You're right. What would my forefathers think if they knew I wasn't paying my debts? Tell Haran I'll bring her the gold I owe.
And I told you I'd pay it when I'm good and ready.

Don't get smart with me. I'm in charge. You keep it up, I'll have your toes cut off.
All right. Open her up.
Now, you. Get down there.
This is a jail, owned by the Silver-Blood family. We use the prisoners to mine for ore.
It's the most secure prison in Skyrim. Throw scum in, close the gates. No one gets out.

We're not. The Silver-Bloods pay our wage. Every man here is a trained mercenary.

You need only ask about. Plenty o' folk in Whiterun with too much fat and gold to be bothered doing anything for themselves.
Truly?
Ha! By Shor, this city could use more like you.
Best head up to Dragonsreach, then, and see the Jarl. He's lord of Whiterun, and can set you on the path.
A pity. And words I hear too often.
But there's no shame in it. One of them dragons comes callin' in Whiterun, the place'll go up like tinder.
Aye, that I do. Have all my life. We Battle-Borns have been here since the beginning. Along with the Gray-Manes.

Always, child. Mara's mercy is ever-flowing.

That may be the case.

Of course you were. Now stop wasting my time.
Well aren't you a strange one.
[QUOTE]Sahloknir! Your soul is bound to me for eternity![QUOTE] (basically starting to cast a spell)
My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow.
She always said composure was the key to a successful archer.
If you can remain calm, even in the midst of chaos, your arrow will most likely find its target.
OK, let's see what you can do.
Remember to stay within the boundaries and only use the practice arrows. I have some if you don't have any.
Aim for the middle target.
Here you go.
You're training someone and informing her of the rules.
Now hit the target to the left.
My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little.
At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market.
So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could.
If you can learn to keep your composure and trust that each shot is true, then you should be able to quickly handle multiple targets.
When I tell you to, try and hit each of the three closest targets in eight seconds.
I'll count to three and then say [QUOTE]go.[QUOTE] You have eight seconds to hit each of the three targets. Draw string and get ready.
You did it! All three targets in eight seconds. Nice job.
Here, take these. Looks like you're running low.
Great shot. Now hit the target to the right.
Shoot the left target.
Shoot the right target.
Shoot the middle target.
You've just finished training the person and sarcastically mention that the person is better than you now.
Said with a smile.
It was my pleasure. It's not often I get visitors out here. Let alone friendly ones.
You're being sarcastic.
Thanks for sticking around and keeping me company.
It was nice to finally meet someone out here who doesn't want to rob you or take off your head.
I know it isn't much, but here, take this bow. It was given to me by my family. It's special to me, but brings back too many painful memories.
Reputation, mostly. A lot of Khajiit turn to smuggling and thievery to get by.
A few bad apples spoil the bunch. You know how it is.
Matter of fact, I do. They've been fair enough with me, far as I can tell.
And a Nord knows a liar when she sees one.
Head up the steps from the market an' look to your right. Can't miss it.
Don't even get me started on that lot.
They put on airs like they're somethin' special. Sure, they've got money, but they ain't got a shred of honor between 'em.
Gray-Mane. Now that's a name fills you with pride. We've got roots in Whiterun. We've got history.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on the dragon that's been terrorizing the countryside. Here, take a look at this decree for details.

About 30 years ago, the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Empire. It was a surprise attack, caught everyone off guard.
They ended up sacking the Imperial City. I was there, blasting apart young Elven men and women with Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.
By Akatosh, all the blood. The smell of flesh burned and pulled apart by magic. I never want to do that to another soul ever again.
This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed.

Arise! Arise and defend us!
Hmph. Plenty.
I'd say we're prosperous enough. Most folk don't go hungry, if they're willing to work hard.
The city's ruled by the Jarl up in Dragonsreach. That's the fortress, there, up on the tall hill.
But you're probably more interested in Jorrvaskr, mead hall of the Companions. Their deeds of war and valor are... legendary.
Yeah, these Khajiit make a living traveling the roads and selling their wares.
It's got to be tough. Skyrim's a hard enough land when you've got a roof over your head.
Worst thing is, nobody wants them in the cities. Nobody trusts them.
About the same as everyone else. They're the cat-folk of Elsweyr. Great warriors, good traders.
Way I hear it, Elsweyr ain't nothing like Skyrim. It's got tropical forests and dusty badlands. It sounds awful!
The heat of battle is the fire that forges the strongest blades. It's an old Nord proverb.
That, and a true Nord never misses a chance to test her worth.
You been talking to those Companions?
Angry, bitter
Angry, defensive, guilty.
Angry, defensive and guilty.
She starts angry, but her voice begins to break with grief when she reaches the admission in the second half of this dialogue.
I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side.
After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?
Lost, stranger?
Looking to practice, stranger?
You're training someone. You're not yelling at the person, just informing.
Ready to practice some more?
Let me know if you want to try again.
Great job hitting those targets. You definitely surprised me with your speed and composure.
It's not often I get visitors out here. You lost, stranger?
Let's see if I can teach you a few things about using a bow.
Remember, composure and speed. You don't need to see your arrow hit before moving onto your next target. Trust your shot is true.
Take care, stranger. Be careful out there.
It was nice to spend time with someone who enjoys archery as much as I do.
Well, let me know if you ever want to practice.
You're pissed off and about to get in a fight.
Nice shot! Right on target.
Now hit it again.
Let me know if you want to practice some more. Next time we'll make it a little more challenging.
You're a little pissed off.
You're not angry, you're just tired of people always feeling sorry for you.
Nice job hitting those targets.
Excellent. Follow me to the targets and we'll begin.
You're counting to three and about to say Go. Don't rush it. About a second between each number.
Time's up! Better luck next time.
Listen to me and you might learn something.

We've got to ground that bastard!
Come on! This is our best chance!

Now it's my turn, you son of a bitch.
For the Blades!
I am Sahloknir! Hear my Voice and despair!

My lord Alduin requires your death. I am glad to oblige him.

Come and face me, then!

My wife Seren and I run it together. She still smiths even though we found out she is with child.
Our son or daughter isn't going to get much Redguard culture here in Skyrim. I know my wife worries how she will pass along her traditions.
Hey, if you find a book called [QUOTE]Night Falls on Sentinel,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? It's a story from my wife's people. Be good to have.
Work? I demand tribute before you can be considered for any real tasks.
How about drink? None of that local piss. Real Black-Briar Mead, fresh from Riften.
Before my ma and da passed, I told them that one day, I'd become the best trader in Skyrim.
I met one of the caravan leaders, Ma'dran. He said he'd help get me started if I could bring him a mammoth's tusk. Easier said than done.
I picked up the trade when I was a girl. One of the temple healers staying here on a pilgrimage showed me the basics.
She had a book with her, [QUOTE]Song of the Alchemists,[QUOTE] that I used to read over and over. I miss having a copy.
That I am. Train the recruits. Turn boys into men. That sort of thing.
Thinking of asking the General for some training books. Give the soldiers something to do while they're on rest. Something besides drinking.
Ever seen a book called [QUOTE]The Mirror[QUOTE]? We used to hand it out to boys looking to learn basic shield work.
Our little girl died recently. I've been shouldering my days with strong mead, but nothing gives my Tova peace.
I've been looking for an Amulet of Arkay to remind my wife that our child is with the gods now, but I can't find one.
Good on you.
You better. I hate people who waste my time.
You'd do that? If you find one, I could teach you a thing or two about trading. Help you get a fair bargain in the future.
Really? I'd be happy to show you a bit about herbs if you find the book.
My loss, right?
Then I don't have time for you.
I'll do my best.
I suppose it is.
Be glad you're not training under me with that mouth of yours.
Good. I'll see if I can get some copies made for the men. Here, something for your trouble. The Legion thanks you.
It's amazing how much you can learn from a book.
Here. Let me show you some of the things the temple healers taught me about potions.
Don't know what the Redguards see in books, but this will make my Seren happy.
Thank you. Let me show you some tricks around the forge.
Now that's what I like to see. Someone who gets things done.
Here. A little something for you.
Thank you. This should turn that old cat's gaze. Maybe I'll be able to become a caravaneer myself, one day.
As promised, let me show you a thing or two about bargaining. Don't want some shifty merchant giving you a raw trade.
I hope Arkay grants my wife some comfort. Thank you. Here. I always pay my debts.
Crazed, grandiose. A wizard ordering his pet rats to attack.
That bard Mikael is begging for a dagger up against his throat, the way he goes on about me.
I've heard him boasting at the Bannered Mare, saying he'll [QUOTE]conquer me as a true Nord conquers any harsh beast.[QUOTE] Hmph.
Torbjorn Shatter-Shield. I wish someone would beat the coin out of his fat fists. He clings to every Septim.
He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a [QUOTE]proper Nord worker.[QUOTE] My people are not slaves!
He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us.
They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical.
Too many drinking games, too many bets, and I'm too old to ever raise the coin on my own.
He's been in Kynesgrove forever. Great storyteller. Keeps everyone's spirits up.
Owes me a lot of coin for drinks. I keep telling him not to worry about it, but he's got the stubborn Nord blood.
Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again.
He owes this tavern enough coin to burn it down, build it back up, then burn it down again just for laughs.
He's had some troubles in his life, but I can't have him drinking here without at least paying back some of the coin he owes.
He's a stubborn oaf. I don't know what good it'll do.
If you want to try, go right ahead. I don't think anything will get through that thick skull of his, though.
You can try, but we've gotten nowhere talking to him ourselves.
You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.
If you could convince him that I don't care about his tab, it'd certainly make me feel better.
Go right ahead. He just might be sober enough to listen to you.
I'm sure. I'm sure.
I can take care of myself. A Whiterun woman learns how to handle a few idiot men early in life.
We will make do somehow. We always have.
Sorries don't help anyone.
He'll be fine, I just hate worrying about his worrying.
I'm sure we'll get our gold at some point. Not like he has anywhere to go.
Anything for my favorite lass.
Oh? Were you after her yourself? I won't stand in your way, my friend. You have my word.
Carlotta put you up to this, didn't she? I'm sorry, but that fiery widow is mine. She just doesn't know it yet.
Well, my friend, if you think those boots needs more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them.
Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers.
What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?
Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do.
I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend.
What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time.
Who are you to say what I should do? I'll pay her back when I'm ready.
Bribing me? Well, a bard does need to eat. On my ancestor's honor, I won't trouble sweet Carlotta again.
sarcastic laugh at the beginning
Paying the wages yourself? Well, I won't say no to gold. By my family's honor, this money will go to the Argonian workers.
What future?
I guess I can spare him a few beatings. Deal.
The only thing I understand is you bothering you.
Works for me. Tell Octieve the debt's settled.
Don't think so.
A true Nord would settle it himself, but at least this way Iddra gets her coin. Thank you. Tell her I'll be fine.
This isn't about me paying Iddra back, this is about me being able to pay her back with my own coin.
I won't say no to that.
I'm not about to take on debts from some milk drinker I don't know.
Whoa. Hey there. I didn't mean to make you upset. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me again.
emphasize: [QUOTE]Maybe I WAS being too harsh on them[QUOTE]
Wait. You win. I'll ease off on the beatings, just leave me alone.
Think you can mess with an Orc of the Reach? Let's go.
All right, all right. Have it your way. Tell Octieve to forget about the debt.
What? No. All right. I won't worry about the coin anymore, just stop giving me that look.
Calm down there, friend. I'll pay! Tell Haran that she'll have her gold.
Wasn't your business, anyway.
Already have.
That's what I thought.
Idiot.
It's better that way.
Really? You convinced that lute player to stop chasing me?
I'd thank the gods, but I'll settle for thanking you. Here's some coin for your help.
You talked Torbjorn down? I'm impressed.
Here, I was saving this for a rainy day. Maybe now I can afford a few more for my people. Take it.
I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us. Here. It's a week's wages for me, but you've earned every coin.
You've done a fine thing for me. You know, I used to be quite a warrior in my day. Let me show you a thing or two.
It'll be good to not have to hear him whining about his debts.
Roggi pawned a few of his things back when he still had things to pawn. Take them.
Thank you. He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink. My husband Dagur could tell you stories, there.
I have a couple of Ranmir's things that he traded to us back when he was still paying regularly. I say you've earned them.
How about a test? Your muscle against mine. The victor gains 100 gold coins from the loser.
I'm drunk, and it's been a while since I had a good fight.
A hundred septims says I can take ya, bare-handed.
And why not? I could beat anyone in this city, bare-handed.
A hundred gold says I knock your hide to the ground.
Don't like it? Too bad. This is our city. Ours!
Don't think I can take you? One hundred septims says I can punch you back where you came from.
Want me to prove it? I bet a hundred gold I can take you, bare-handed.
This will be good training. Let's go!
You're short on coin.
That's the spirit! Let's go.
Hey, I may have had a few, but I can still count. You don't have a hundred septims on you.
Just fists. No weapons, no magic... no crying. Let's go!
Why don't you come back when you actually have a hundred gold?
All right. Fists only. And none of that magic stuff, either. Let's go!
I said a hundred gold! Damn broke elves and damn broke elf-lovers.
Just your own two hands. Weapons and magic are out. Now let's see what you got!
Come back when you have the coin.
Soft. Just like all outlanders.
Pfft. Snowback.
Milk drinker.
Pit bait.
You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip.
You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?
You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue.
Oh, well, it's just... I never imagined the Gourmet was a Khajiit. You know, because of all the fur, and the potential for getting hair in the...
A lofty goal, to be sure. And what brings your search to our doorstep?
I'll take a bottle of spiced wine.
I haven't known you to drink before, Ataf.
A bottle of spiced wine for ya, Ataf?
Viarmo is trying to get Elisif to allow the Burning of King Olaf. I don't want to look like I don't know how to drink in front of the other bards.
No thank you. I'm still feeling sick from the festival.
Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot.
Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes.
Plenty of ways to worship the Divines as you know.
Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here.
A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist.
Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?
Are your sales going well?
I hope the Divines have been keeping you well.
Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders.
They seem to when you're around Silana.
It should be quite the affair. Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war.
Vittoria is practically glowing.
I went out ice fishing a few days ago.
Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?
Naw, mostly just froze.
Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite.
Spiced Wine for the Winking Skeever?
Actually just a bottle for me today. I'm thinking of giving it to Vivienne.
Sure, Sorex. Just like you did the last one.
The last one was warm up.
Brusque, hostile.
You're a racist bully warning a countryman about the minority you dislike. Said with sneering contempt.

May Talos shield you from all harm.
May Talos bless your days.
Blessings of Arkay be upon you.
Too few remember to honor the god of the dead. Do not be one of those.
The Divines smile on a charitable soul.
Don't forget them who's less fortunate than yourself.
Polite.
Playful, confident. You are secretly the leader of a thieves' guild, and you tend to view everyone as a potential mark.
Enjoy your stay, and don't break nothin'!
Mind you don't put out that candle on the hearth upstairs!
A bit scared.
Grateful.
Flirtatious.
A word of advice -- don't buy discounted armor.
If you've need of weapons or armor, come back and see Oengul.
May the earth beneath your feet be always soft.
I hope we will speak again soon, marsh-friend.
Trust me, marsh-friend, you do not want to live in this city.
I would not complain if you returned with some Skooma.
Friendly
Travel safely. It's dangerous out there.
If you'll excuse me, I must return to my duties.
Do come again!
Enthusiasm. You love books.
If you need another drink, I'll be right here.
Have a seat, there should be plenty of space.
Somber, tinged with grief
Somber
Be sure to stop by Sadri's Used Wares in the Gray Quarter.
Take care, friend.
Sometimes the difference between life an' death is a swift steed.
Sorry about the smell. It's a stable, after all.
Whether it's armor you need or a new blade, come see me.
If you meet anyone in your travels who needs good steel, send them my way.
Strength and steel are well and good, but magic is the true power in this world.
A strong sword-arm wins battle, but a keen mind wins wars.
Safe journeys, sword-brother.
Farewell, then.
Alright, then.
Good day to you.
If you're not doing something you enjoy, then you're wasting your life.
I hope to see you again soon.
If you have need of tonics or potions, come see me at my shop.
Watch yourself out there.
Battle reveals who a man really is. Remember that.
Keep on your guard. This city can be a little rough for those such us.
It was a pleasure.
I should have been an adventurer like you, instead of a farmer.
Never trade a sword for a hoe, my friend.
Right. See you around.
Saying goodbye, a friendly parting
Then, as I've said, 1000 gold will be required to set things right.
I made it rather clear that a donation of 500 gold will clear it up rather neatly.
As I've said, a donation of 250 should help take care of that.
It's most unfortunate that we need to have this discussion once again.
These matters are becoming more difficult to deal with. I'm going to need 1000 gold from you in order to make reparations.
I also hope that this is the last time we'll need to discuss this.
Another incident? I must say, I'm disappointed.
I thought I made it clear that this sort of behavior is totally unacceptable.
It cannot become widely known that these sorts of things happen here. Work will need to be done to keep this quiet.
I think a donation of 500 gold on your part is necessary in order to put this behind us.
Ah, yes. There was an incident, wasn't there?
Well, as this is the first time this has happened, I'll make it very clear that the College does not condone that sort of behavior.
As an act of good faith on your part, I'd advise that you consider donating an amount of gold to the College.
Strictly to cover damages, you understand. I believe 250 gold should be sufficient.
Yes. I hope this will be enough to maintain order.
Once again, your suspension is lifted. Please try and control yourself.
Very good. I'll see that this is put towards getting things back to normal.
Consider the suspension lifted.
Oh, excellent. I'll see that it gets where it needs to go.
And I'll make sure the suspension is lifted. I'm glad we were able to clear this matter up, and I do hope we don't need to have this talk again.
You don't seem to have the gold on you. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?
Then I'm afraid your suspension will stand for now. I'm sorry, but that's the way it has to be.
wounded
I have no idea what happened. Ancano did it, I think.
I don't see the Arch-Mage. He must've been blown clear. I need you to find him immediately, all right? Make sure he's safe.
Get moving, now. I'll be fine.
Come on, Arniel. Let's go.
Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.
That looks like it's the last of them.
We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on.
It's none of your concern. All you need to know is that we're paying for information.
If that doesn't interest you, feel free to walk away.

I hope one day I'll convince Rustleif to take us back there. Until then, I'm content running the forge together here in Dawnstar.
So it's true. That traitorous bitch! Morthal owes you a debt.
Here. You were promised a reward for solving the crime, but I need one more favor from you.
Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a master vampire I thought was destroyed a century ago.
I'll gather together some able-bodied warriors to clean out Movarth's lair. They'll be waiting outside for you to lead them.
By Ysgramor's axe! It's true. Morthal owes you a debt.
Here is your reward for solving the murder, but I have another request.
Unfortunately Morthal is still in danger. The journal mentions Movarth, a powerful master vampire that I had assumed was destroyed.
Then stop wasting my time.
Did you see that candle above the fire upstairs?
It was lit one hundred and sixty-three years ago, back when this building was the home of a grand warrior named Vundheim.
When word came that he'd fallen, his son Deroct lit the candle in his honor. Nobody knows why it still burns.

Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Brother.
Another piece of glory. Good work, Shield-Sister.
I don't see these troubles as business. This is a labor of honor.
To bring Ulfric his rightful glory, I would hammer a thousand shields.
Shor's bones, I might just have to!
Every bit as sharp as what you'll find in Whiterun.
I respect Eorlund, but he has the good fortune to work the Skyforge. Something about the fires... their steel just holds tighter.
You know what I mean. Forges have personalities, right?
If that makes any sense.
For Ulfric? Oh, nothing official. Known him for years.
He seems to value my thoughts, and I'm grateful for that.
I don't really have a mind for war, and I think he likes having an untrained opinion from time to time.
Grew up here. Colder as Atmora, but that just grows the beards thicker!
Lot of history in these walls. We're trying to make some more. It's a lucky time to be alive.
No, but then I don't have much need for Ulfric.
We both leave well enough alone.
Whatever I don't already know.
Power is the crux of this world. There's always more of it to be had, if you look in the right places.
Are you kidding? I came all the way from Cyrodiil just to work with him.
He's... he's not the best teacher. But just watching him, I've learned so much.
It doesn't matter what I believe. Nurelion does, and it might be the only thing keeping him alive right now.
I'll carry on his tradition as best I can. I could spend a lifetime just going over his notes.
Every Nord should admire Ulfric. He fights for all of us.
In fact, he's the reason I chose to learn the smithing trade. I want to make weapons and armor for the great Stormcloak army.
Smithing isn't the most exciting thing for me, but we all have to lend a hand as best we can.
If a Stormcloak uses one of my swords to strike down an Imperial soldier, then I've done my part to free our land.
We work where we can get work. The Nords don't like unloading their ships, so we do it instead.
Sometimes cargo goes missing.
I came here as a hatchling. The only thing colder than Skyrim is the Nords themselves, but we stick together.
Wherever I can find them. If you're the type who worries over where something came from, you may want to move on.
There's an old saying that only a Nord can work the soil in Skyrim. I don't think anyone else would have the patience for it.
It takes half a day just to dig a planting row in the cold, stony earth here. But what else can we do, eat rocks and ice?
Just got here from the Summerset Isles. Lots of opportunity in Skyrim.
Pfft. I'm the oldest woman in Dawnstar. Was here when the Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger.
He's a fool, if you haven't met him already. Thinks Ulfric Stormcloak is invincible and spits dragon fire.
The people here look to Brina Merilis when they need things settled. Real firebrand going up. Wasn't surprised when she joined the Legion.
Seems Brina Merilis and the Legion came and now she's Jarl. That's a relief. I don't like the fighting, but Brina is the woman for the job.
Aye. I've worked on a few moorings here and there for it. Most of the ship captains are superstitious about who works on their vessels, though.
And Dawnstar is known for its bad luck. We're the last port of call before Windhelm, and the ore we trade makes rich targets for pirates.
Not much. I came here a few years ago from Hammerfell when I married.
The land is beautiful, but I can't stand this cold. I don't know how Rustleif manages it.
a patriotic summation of his reasons for being here.
Well, I don't know. Not yet... it flew over the town and landed on the old dragon mound!
It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound.
I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!
My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change.
If it's my fate to be ended by a dragon, so be it. Meantime, I'll live my life the way I want to.
Been about eight years now. I used to be a mercenary, but one trip to Ravenscar Hollow cured me of that.
There's hagravens in that cave with talons like daggers. They'll open your bowels quick as a wink if you let 'em get close.
Creature like that'll make a man think long and hard about what he wants out of life.
Hmm... Your creature doesn't appear to be fairing any better than before. Methinks your aim is off.
You seem to be having a small problem... or perhaps it's a big problem? Maybe if you shrunk the whole thing down a little first?
Still can't wake him up? Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree?
Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?
Free of charge for you.
That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way.
I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies.
The guy in from Dragon Bridge? He didn't seem the type.
You never can tell.
There's nothing quite like a good vegetable.
Vegetables are the food of the Divines.
I've heard stanger things, are eaten over at the Temple of the Divines.
I keep coming out here thinking I'll see what others see in this... frivolity.
Your a hard woman to please Una.
I'm pleased when the palace is clean, I'm pleased when the beds are made on time, I'm pleased when I Erdi isn't around.
Most of those don't happen very often.
I like you Una. You've got presence.
You like everyone Jorn. You'll make a good court bard some day.
I don't think that was a compliment.
Sometimes I like to think my cooking is like playing the flute or singing a song.
I've tasted your food, Odar. It's better than most songs I've heard.
How do you put up with that fop Fihada?
I once saw Fihada put an arrow in between the eyes of a Blackblood Marauder at five hundred paces.
You don't put up with a man like that. He puts up with you.
Thanks. Papa talks about it some. Mum doesn't say much since Uncle Roggvir died. She doesn't even go to Temple anymore.
I wish she would. At least that way she'd have people to talk to.
You would do that? That's great. You should go do it right now.
Yeah, that's what papa says too.
She did, did she? She's going to get a sit down later.
Well. I wish it were that simple.
Maybe it is. Look, I want to go back but I won't feel right in there without a tie to Talos.
My brother Roggvir wore a symbol of Talos. He kept it hidden on his person. If I had that...
I can't go near his body. Would you get it back for me?
Why did you... nevermind, it's a sign. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your help.
Thanks so much. I'll return to temple. Here's something for your time and effort.
As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place.
My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed.
The marsh is treacherous. You would do well to not wander at night.
Slow? No. It just ain't there at all.
Few enough reasons to pass through Morthal before the war started.
Now... Well, let's just say the front door doesn't get much use.
Lurbuk?
Fancies himself a bard. He pays, so I let him stay.
If I had any customers, I'd be worried about him annoying them. But, well... Look around.
No, no. Well, sometimes, but that's not the problem.
I just often don't have much to do, so I tend to... I try things out. They don't usually work, but I try.
Next thing I know, I've used up most of my stock.
Lock the city gate.
Positions.
Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today.
Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple.
It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping.
One apple. Since the Blackbloods were dispatched I've had good luck getting shipments.
I could listen to him play all day.
I could listen to her play all day.
He's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
She's okay. A little breathy and a little harsh on the notes.
Speaking of harsh.
You Bards don't cut each other any slack do you?
Not in our nature.
Do you miss your days training at the College?
Absolutely not. I prefer to be near enough to come visit but free to come and go as I please.
Well, you can understand Elisif not wanting it.
I'm so glad we got to have it. I thought for sure Elisif would never consent.
It's too bad the Burning of King Olaf was called off this year. I think some of the younger bards would really have gotten a kick out of it.
I think our flutist here has gotten better since the Burning of King Olaf.
It is a shame though.
I think I may wait until the Burning of King Olaf to have and Spiced Wine.
You and everyone else. Word is it may not happen this year though.
Oh, no. But being surrounded by good music, good drink and good friends is all I've ever asked for.
Generally, if you want rumors, you should talk to Corpulus. That said... I did see a visitor pass through on his way to the Blue Palace.
Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks.
Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though.
My mother always used to say that too.
Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?
Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund.
How about I trade you a song for some fruit?
You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway.
You're really going to the Blue Palace? That presents an opportunity.
If you were willing to wear one of Radiant Raiment's outfits and speak to the Jarl I would not only pay you but let you keep the outfit.
Good. Here's the outfit. Try to get Elisif's opinion on it and if she likes it mention it's from Radiant Raiment.
Look silly! As if you could look any sillier than you do now.
It's quite fetching actually. The craftsmanship is excellent.
Oh really? Well you can tell them that I will be putting in a request for a few dresses quite soon.

I'll be over here if you need any potions or ingredients.
Hello there, can I pour you a Black-Briar Mead?
Ah good, back for some more Black-Briar mead, eh?
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. Come on in, take a look around.
Welcome back to the Prawn. Let me know if you need anything.
greeting a friend who just stepped through the door.
suspicious of an uninvited guest
That's wonderful. You've done us a great service. As promised the outfit is yours and here's something for your trouble.
Hail, friend! It's good to see another merry soul enjoying this fine day.
You've never had a taste of sweet Honningbrew? Why, it's only the finest mead outside of Sovngarde!
Its sweetness is like a fair maiden's kiss on a starry night. And it's got enough kick to put a frost troll on his hind quarters! Ha!
Ha, nothing like fine spirits to help raise your... well, your spirits!
Cheers, my friend! May your adventures find you fame and fortune!
angry and offended
Black Briar Mead? What are you trying to do? Poison me?
Ysmir's beard! You're one after my own heart. I would love another bottle.
This good deed should not go unrewarded. Here, take this!
Ah, is there any way you'd rather spend the day than drinking Honningbrew Mead?
Drink Honningbrew Mead with a wench on each arm? Ha ha!
I'd rather have two bottles of mead then two wenches, friend.
Why's that?
The meads won't argue your ear off about which one should go first!
Ha! Too true, my friend. Too true...
I don't talk to people who drink that Black Briar drench.
You are haunted by the memories of friends you have lost recently.
You are pleading fervently.
I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.
I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.
Do you think it's gone yet?
Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?
We've got to find someplace to hide!
Wait. Something's wrong.
Come on. Hurry. We might be too late.
Dibella, guide us.
Lead us to your Sybil.
My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty.
Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them.
As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way.
If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example...
We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?
Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?
I'll be glad to help you. There are many ways to improve your home, provided you have the coin.
And of course, don't forget to consult your Home Decorating Guide for descriptions of the decorations you can buy.
Now, what would you like to purchase?
You've already purchased every available improvement. I'm afraid I have nothing else to offer you.
Splendid! There's a house available right now.
The house I mentioned earlier is still available, if you want to buy it.
Wonderful! Here is the key to your new home.
Very well, just let me know when you're ready to purchase the house.
Very well, just let me know when you have the necessary funds.
Is there anything else you'd like to purchase?
As you wish. Speak to me again if you decide to purchase some decorations for your home.
I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough gold to pay for that.
Very well, I'll make the arrangements. The next time you visit your house, your new furnishings will be in place.
Waiting for what?
No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.
Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it?
Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it.
Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it.
he's pretty sure you're lying
Closest town from here is Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he'd help you out.
It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today.
earnestly
We need to talk.

That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.

Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it.
Skjor was looking for you, earlier.
Degaine the beggar got himself kicked out the Temple of Dibella. Caused quite the ruckus.
I'm not interested, Jaree. It doesn't matter how many times you ask.

We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance.
The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim.
Ah. I sometimes forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation:
[QUOTE]Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.[QUOTE]
He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue.
After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat.
He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice.
He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory of men.
Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born.
The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods.
If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh.
We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals.
That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood is itself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift.
Your destiny requires you to use your Voice - why else would Akatosh have bestowed this power upon you?
If you remember to use your Voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way.
Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.
There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it.
sharply
Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed.
I'm sorry, were you about to say something?
angry, suspicious
Hey! It's the bard-to-be.
We have guests as often as we can but there aren't a lot of travellers these days. The war keeps people off the roads.
We supply Falkreath to the south. Until recently we supplied Helgen.
Falkreath trades with the surrounding holds and without our wood they would have trouble keeping their prices low.
Other people just make things complex. Out here, Hern and I can get everything we need from the occasional traveler.
I can't thank you enough for what you did.
The East Empire Company is in your debt.
Glad Orthus was able to find someone competent to help out.
You handled yourself pretty well back at Japhet's Folly. We'll remember that.
bring it on!
utter shock
sudden worry and sadness
While I feel Ulfric's cause is just, my concern is for the people of The Rift.
How can they continue to lead their already meager lives with dark clouds looming overhead?
My heart goes out to them. If only our coffers were deeper, I could protect them as they were my own family.
With the Stormcloaks at his back, Ulfric's poised to rid Skyrim of the Empire's forces and invalidate our involvement with the White-Gold Concordat.
Between you and I, I think his motivations are a bit more self-serving. He uses this holy war as leverage in order to pursue the throne.
If he were to be crowned High King, I'm not so certain it would be the golden age his followers expect.
Many have died taking up arms for this cause. I fear that the land will be stained with blood for years to come.
Surely you're aware of the Great War between the Imperials and the Elves who called themselves the Aldmeri Dominion?
When the smoke cleared, the White-Gold Concordat was signed... it was supposedly a treaty aimed at establishing peace within the Empire.
One of the terms of the treaty was the outlawing of worship to Talos.
To the Stormcloaks, this was viewed as the moment when the Empire became unworthy of the allegiance of any true Nord.
Indeed. There have been multiple attempts on the Jarl's life. We're not certain if it's the Dark Brotherhood or simply Imperial sympathizers.
We've also had run-ins with spies attempting to probe our security for weaknesses. I work with the city guard to make certain they fail.
At the end of the day, I'm the last line of defense for the Jarl. I will not allow her to fall.
As long as she continues to keep me at her side, she can count on my blade to protect her.
To be honest, I doubt someone would be stupid enough to make an attempt on Maven... sorry, Jarl Maven's life.
But just in case, I'll be ready for them.
Not well I'm afraid. That Brynjolf... he keeps draining the people's pockets with his ridiculous miracle cures.
A few months ago it was troll fat salve and now he's got something new.
Not that there's anything that can be done about it. He's in good with the Thieves Guild.
He's the protector of Man, the Dragon of the North, the patron of all Nords.
And despite the Imperials and their treaty, he will always be one of the Nine Divines.
A devout Nord would rather fall in battle and have his blood spill upon the earth than allow the Empire to strike his name from the divinity.
Maven Black-Briar wants me to keep the mead flowing and that's what I aim to do despite all these lazy good-for-nothings that work for us.
Ever since I took over as the foreman the production of our mead has never been more profitable.
And if the meadery is profitable, I get rich. Get the picture?
Lady Maven could buy or sell anyone in Skyrim. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the one pulling the strings around this city.
She's always welcome in Mistveil Keep and between you and me, I'm pretty sure she even has some pretty influential friends within the Empire.
I'd also warn you not to cross her. She employs quite a few... troubleshooters  to take care of messy problems.
Yes, I suppose someone has to be around here. Have you seen the condition of this sorry excuse for a city?
Beggars roam the streets, crime runs rampant and the threat of war is driving away business.
The paltry amount of coin that I place in the charity box at the temple is the least I can do to help.
Of course! I'd be more than happy to add a donation to our charity box.
Right now, the best you could provide is coin. We need all the help we can get.
Thank you! I can promise you that this will be put to good use.
As you wish. Whatever you can afford will certainly be put to good use.
People say I'm making gold off of other people's misery, but what else would I do? Smithing is all I know.
Next time one of my shields deflects a killing blow, they'll change their tune.
Been stuck with the name for years.
I've been ridin' horses since I was a lad... nothin' I liked more. But as I got bigger, so did my mounts.
Then one day, I was drunker than I've ever been and mounted a poor colt. Broke his back in two. Haven't ridden since.
The moisture in the air is better for the ingredients. It isn't every day that you get your hands on fresh nirnroot or painted troll fat.
It also makes it easier to gather water when the canal is right out the front door.
Besides, I also prefer the quiet. I didn't open this business for browsing. Come in, buy what you need and get out.
I've been adventuring across Tamriel since I was a fresh-faced young woman barely able to swing a blade.
My travels have taken me from High Rock to Valenwood, Elsweyr to Morrowind and all points in between.
I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up.
Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way.
A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.
I only hope we can restore the Guild to its former glory after all the damage that's been done.
So, word has it you and Brynjolf know where Mercer's hiding. Good.
Make sure you make him pay for what he did to Gallus... heck, for what he did to all of us.
We're all behind you, friend. Do your best.
The word is that Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood.
I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it.
You need to teach him a lesson... show him the penalty for betrayal around here.
Look, I like you, so I'll tell it to you straight. Brynjolf and the rest are in the Guild, and they're ready to cut you down.
I know you have a damn good reason for siding with Karliah, so I hope you can give it to them.
Everyone's been worried since you and Mercer haven't shown up in a while. Brynjolf even went out to find you.
Delvin and Vex have been running things for now.
I hope this all gets straightened out soon or I'm headed on the first caravan out of Riften.
Glad to hear Gulum-Ei got what he deserved. That lizard owes me big for a bad shipment of Shadowbanish Wine he tried to pass off on me.
Mercer's been storming around waiting for you to come back. I think he's finally figured out who's been messing with the Guild.
Never seen the guy so angry. Better help him out any way you can.
Maven was down here right before you got back and she was all smiles. Haven't seen her like that in a long time.
Whatever you did at Honningbrew, you're now on her good side. Best of all, if she's happy, Mercer's happy.
Keep it up and you'll go places.
Well, you did something Vex couldn't do at Goldenglow, so you're looking pretty damn good.
Word is that you found something while you were out there though... something that could be a problem for the Guild.
Just watch your back and do what Mercer says... he'll sort it out.
I don't know about the others, but I sure am glad to see a fresh face down here.
The Flagon used to be packed every night with the boys from the Guild but now look at it.
Last few years have been pretty bad. I've almost closed this place up.
I don't know you so we've got nothing to talk about. How about you finish the job Brynjolf gave you, then we can talk.
Sure. How about you mind your own business about it, and I won't have to get Dirge to toss you into the cistern?
It would be my pleasure.
Are you ready to go?
All aboard!
Let me know. We shouldn't stay here all day. My men want their mead.
There you are.
Long sorrowfully (has) waited the Stormcrown, with no worthy head to rest on.
By our Voice we give it now (to you), Dragonborn, by (the) power of Kyne, by the power of Shor, and by the power of Atmora-of-old.
(You have) become now Ysmir, Dragon of the North. Remember these words.
this is a whispered shout, so it should have an intake of breath before speaking the word [QUOTE]Dah[QUOTE]
You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you.
Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready.
I'll do anything if it means saving my brother. You'll join us, won't you?
Thorald can't be left to those... monsters.
Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here.
You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.
Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple...
Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards... I might be able to help you.
Well, we can always use contributions.
Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up.
I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.
I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense.
You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.
You said a whole lot of nonsense about selling Gleda to hire a priestess for some big event.
There was a bit of talk about some staff you had in safe keeping. Never said where, but you sure didn't have it with you!
Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again.
Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.
Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said [QUOTE]after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.[QUOTE]
That's all I know.
Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda.
Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly.
I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.
I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.
You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that.
But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back.
You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!
I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be.
If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.
All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober.
You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.
You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.
Well, I know the Companions make their home here. Their mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is the oldest building in the city.
Oh, and there's a nasty feud between two families called the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns. You'll want to be careful there.
The rest you can find out by asking the townsfolk. I'd start with the barkeep at the Bannered Mare, or the castle steward.
It's an old city, I can tell you that. The Palace of the Kings is ancient.
It's not the friendliest place for outsiders. The Dark Elves were all forced to live in a slum called the Gray Quarter.
The Argonians can't even live inside the walls. They're all stuck out on the docks.
Still, Candlehearth Hall's got decent food and cheap bunks. You could do worse.
Solitude's been the capital of Skyrim as long as I can remember. Most of the High Kings of Skyrim were Jarls of Solitude first.
Ah, let's see, what else... The Bards College is here, and the main office of the East Empire Company.
If you need it, you can get a room for a fair price at the Winking Skeever, just inside the main gate.
You can get a room at the Bee and Barb, but mind your coin purse -- it's no secret the Thieves' Guild makes its home here.
Oh, and if you meet Maven Black-Briar, stay on her good side. This is her city, and nobody else's.
Indignant, angry
Indignant, annoyed.
None of 'em's older than nine, and the youngest is six.
Now, the horse I got for sale is seven years old, but in fine health. She's got a lot of spirit, that one.
We've taken to calling her Queen Alfsigr, or just Allie for short. I expect you can name her anything you like once she's yours.
Another time, or not at all. It's really none of your business, after all.
Father says I should pick a name that describes what I really am,  but nobody's going to hire Erik Greenthumb or Erik Hoe-pusher.
No, I need a name that will put some fear in the hearts of my enemies. When I have some enemies, that is.
No! You will not deny me this!
No! The Eye is mine!
You cannot take this away from me!
Return with the gauntlets, or not at all.
You have returned with the gauntlets! Enter. Speak to our chief right away.
small laugh... found player's response amusing
If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher, things will never be the same for the Guild.
As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade.
Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him.

Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed.
If you wish to talk, I'll be here for a bit.
Proceed down the hall to the gate when you're ready.
This way, please.
Please hurry, we need to catch Mercer before he leaves Skyrim.
Best get rid of the ones we see. Just in case.
A few hours sleep and we should be ready to continue through.
I can't do this. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry.
This should compensate you for your find.
What a delightful find! This should cover it.
It's worth quite a bit actually. Quite a catch! Here you go, this should make you smile.
Must have come from Mercer's place. He'd admired the Gray Fox for some time. Sure, I'll buy it from you... here you are.
By the Eight... you actually got your hands on it! This alone is worth more than some thieves earn in a lifetime.
Look, I've moved all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk and I'm barely scraping by.
I'm not out to win friends and I could care less if you're happy about your purchase or not. I just need the coin.
The sooner I get out of Skyrim the better.
Are you serious? The war is tearing the land apart, the dragons have returned seeking who knows what... Skyrim is going nowhere fast.
If I were you, I'd pack up and get out of here before you end up in one of those burial cairns.
There are those that believe the Jarl does nothing for this city... that it's corrupt and run by the Black-Briar family.
I can assure you that this is entirely false. We are fully in control of everything.
Maven Black-Briar is the owner of the largest and most profitable business in all Skyrim, the Black-Briar Meadery.
We're pleased to have her in Riften. She brings stability, opportunities for employment and strategic value to our city.
Maven Black-Briar, the matriarch of the family, represents everything that's wrong with this city.
She's bribed countless officials, has friends back in the Imperial City and freely associates with the Thieves Guild.
I've tried everything I can to protect Riften's citizens from her family, but to no avail.
The Black-Briars have been instrumental in keeping Riften on the map.
Before the meadery was opened almost fifty years ago, this town was nothing... a simple waypoint for those journeying on to Morrowind.
Now, thanks to my mother's generosity, this city is making its mark.
When speaking of the Black-Briars, only one thought should spring to mind. We are not to be trifled with.
Help us, you end up rich. Cross us and you'll end up a memory. Is that enough information for you?
Hmph. My family. All that wealth and they squander it on foolish ventures and political schemes.
I was meant for so much more than all of this... I wish to pledge my life and ply my talents in darker circles.
If only my mother would let me, I would make her proud.

Right now, all that matters is my daughter Mila. No man's going to get between me and my little girl.
I can tell you're new around here, askin' a question like that.
My husband Eorlund tends the Skyforge up at Jorrvaskr, the Companions mead hall. There's no finer smith in the nine holds.
You should ask him about his work. It's the only subject that'll get him talking.
Well, that and maybe those stuck-up, dung-sniffing Battle-Borns.
Curse you for bringing up that bitter memory.
Not long ago it was my husband Eorlund. There was no finer smith in the nine holds.
Now he's dead and gone and the Skyforge of Jorrvaskr lies cold.
Try Hulda, the innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.
You should check in at Dragonsreach, too. There's so much going on these days, the Jarl or his Steward might have need of help.
Try Olfina, the new innkeeper at the Bannered Mare. It's just up the road, near the market.
Why, because I'm a proud citizen of the Empire? Because the Stormcloaks only want Nords in Skyrim?
The Stormcloaks can rot in Oblivion for all I care. I've lived in this city for twenty years. Twenty!
That'll be the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. He's an honorable enough man. Never done wrong by me or my kin.
Things are tough for him now, I'd wager. What with the fighting, and the dragons. But Balgruuf's a tough old Nord. He can handle it.
Hrongar became the Jarl when his brother Balgruuf, who had the job before him, was murdered.
Balgruuf was an even-tempered man, but his brother's a hot-blooded war-monger who wants to settle everything with a blade.
If you've got some business with Hrongar, mind you stay on his good side. The palace dungeon's filled with folk who roused his temper.
Vignar the Revered is the Jarl in Whiterun. I guess he was a great hero once, because the Companions all call him [QUOTE]Vignar the Revered.[QUOTE]
Is Vignar too old to be Jarl? It's a fair question. If he's grown infirm and is losing his wits, where does that leave the people of Whiterun?
Interesting, to say the least. What with all that's been going on.
On the one hand, supplies are harder to come by, since fewer traders are traveling the roads these days.
But on the other, the scarcity of supplies has led to some, well, [QUOTE]elevated[QUOTE] prices.
All that matters is that I have what you need. And it's worth every septim.
Sarcastic
Ah, but without a doubt, the most compelling feature of this frozen wasteland is the volley of inane questions leveled at me on a regular basis.
Her name's Olda. If you've met her, then you probably already know what I'm talking about.
I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be.
Hard to say. It's ancient, that much we know for sure. It was here long before the town itself.
I just hope the bridge survives the war. It's the only place you can cross the Karth river for a long way in either direction.
Could be if one side wants to keep the other from coming across, they might try to knock it down.
I grew up an orphan on the streets of Markarth. I'd have died there, too, but for the kindness of an old warrior named Logrolf the Bent.
Logrolf rescued me and gave me enough money to get out of the city. I followed the Karth river north, and came here.
When I met Michel, I knew this was where I belonged. I suppose that's it, really.
Both the Imperials and Stormcloaks have sent riders this way, scouting the bridge and the lands nearby.
They stayed at the inn, but didn't pay. They said soldiers don't need to pay because they're risking their lives to protect us.
And that's not all. They took a heap of our lumber, and one tried to have his way with my daughter. They think they can do whatever they want.
Of course. Every night I pray that we don't get a visit from a dragon, or that two armies don't show up to fight over the bridge.
You ask if I'm worried? I'm terrified, if you want to truth of it. But I have to stay strong for my wife and children.
What are you waiting for? Get in there and find that mask.
Any progress on finding the mask?
Don't bother me if you haven't found anything about the mask.
Sighs before the second sentence.
Well then, what are you waiting for? Get in there and earn your pay.
Not to mention our pay.
Besides, you're not scared of a few sleeping metal men. Are you, Drennen?
Properly controlled, it has knowledge enough to turn paupers into kings.

The Legion's always been here. Without us to keep order, the provinces would fall into barbarism and lawlessness. Especially Skyrim.

But that was precisely the point! He was a puppet-king of the Empire , not a High King of Skyrim.

He was too privileged and too foolish, more interested in entertaining his queen than ruling his country.
There hasn't been a true High King in Skyrim for generations.

Indeed, Elisif has become Jarl of Solitude, historically and conveniently home of the High King, backed by Imperial interests.

He's sending you after King Olaf's Verse then? That's good, we shouldn't leave it lying around now that I've figured out where it is.
The Verse was Svaknir's contribution to the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Each bard adds to the Edda in his or her time.
And a very ancient one.
The verse criticized the reigning King Olaf. He was so incensed the bard was put to death and all the copies burned.
At least, that's what we thought until I translated some ancient texts a year or so ago. We now believe King Olaf buried the truth with the bard.
If I'm right Svaknir and King Olaf's Verse lie in Dead Men's Respite, along with the burial chamber of King Olaf himself.
I think Giraud here would give you the best explanation of both it and the history of King Olaf's Verse. You should speak to him about it.

You will pay for stealing from me you eyeless freak!
This is not an empty threat, you are already moving to attack.
We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.
Now let's move. I think that was the last of the Silver Hand, but still plenty of draugr for the both of us.

Since Adrianne's death, I've had to buy them from the Khajiit caravans.
Sheepish
Of a sort. I don't have formal training in the Restoration school, but... something just as good.
Within these walls, I have all that I need to brew a potion for nearly any ailment.
If I had a Septim for every case of Rockjoint or Witbane I've cured since I opened this shop, I'd be a rich woman indeed.
Yes, I hear that question often.
My brother Anoriath and I came up with it one night after consuming... rather too much mead.
After our drinks, we went out for a moonlight hunt. We got separated, and in his drunken state my brother mistook me for a deer.
He shot an arrow that pierced my... well, my rump. After such a memorable adventure, we knew we had the name for our shop.
Oh, yes. Hunting is my great passion.
That's why my brother and I opened a shop to sell hunting supplies. It's the Drunken Huntsman, down by the main gate.
He tends the store, and I've got this stall.
In the very oldest tales, back from when there still were dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power.
That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?

They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps.
They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place.
I'd hardly call them a Guild. More like unorganized rabble.
In fact, I wouldn't say they were a threat at all. No, our resources should be spent on preparations for invasion.
We're all eager to see them brought to justice. Maven Black-Briar has assured me that they're being dealt with appropriately.
As one of our city's most influential citizens, she's has taken it upon herself to oversee their incarceration.
Sadly, they're proving elusive but I have confidence that Maven won't give up until this city has been rid of them all.
Liars and bastards. Every one of them. I'd have their heads on a pike if it wasn't for the war effort.
All I need is a dozen men and we could march into the Ratway and burn them out like rodents.
Stormcloaks won't have it though. Too busy keeping the Imperial forces at bay.
They're vermin... garbage. They're exactly what makes this city such a horrible place to live.
How appropriate they should live in the Ratway with the rest of the trash.
They'd stop at nothing to take your last bit of food if that's all you had.
The Ratway's too good of a place for that scum.
They used to be pretty feared around here. I mean, you'd whisper the name and it'd send chills down your spine.
Now, they're nothing more than ruffians and thugs trying to pry a few extra coin from honest people.
All it would take is a small force of guard to go into the Ratway and flush them out.
It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!
If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels.
Disgusting. Ruined sewers filled with goodness knows what.
There's an entrance down by the canal, but I'd highly advise you stay out of there... its the Thieves Guild's territory.
Everyone knows the Thieves Guild uses the old sewer system beneath Riften as their hideout.
I'd go down there myself, but that would leave Jarl Laila unprotected.
There are ruined sewer tunnels beneath the city. The only way I know how to get in there is through a door off of the canal.
If I were you, I'd keep my feet dry and stay up here.
It's our name for the old sewers that run under the city.
It used to be a huge system hundreds of years ago but it fell into decay just like the rest of Riften.
The Guild stocks the place full of thugs that aren't good enough to join, so watch yourself if you venture down there.
I may be dark elf by birth, but I was raised Argonian.
Through reasons I'm still trying to discover, I ended up orphaned then taken in by a kindly Argonian family in Black Marsh.
I hope one day to find out what happened to me... how I ended up like that.
It doesn't matter. It's also none of your concern.
Just talk to him; see if you can convince him to give my amulet back.
I told you, it's from my family.
I don't... I know they always disapproved of what I wanted in life, to learn magic instead becoming a farmer, or a hunter.
But no matter how poorly they may have treated me, they're still my family. I didn't consider that until after I'd made the trade.
Oh my. How precious.
Onmund is too afraid to deal with me himself, and so he's sent you.
I'll make this very simple for you. All my trades are final. Onmund knew this ahead of time, and went through with it anyway.
So there's nothing more to be said.
I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.
Oh, I suppose. But you keep this to yourself; I don't want it being known that I go back on my trades. Understand?
Yes, you see, the thing is... I'm not concerned with [QUOTE]everyone's best interest.[QUOTE] I find I'm only concerned with my own.
No, no. You're not understanding this.
Onmund made a deal. He made that choice, and now he has to live with it.
Onmund gave up the first time I said no. But not you...
All right. I'll tell you a little story.
Let's pretend for a moment that a certain individual was looking to acquire a particular staff.
Let's also pretend that he traded some valuable items for said staff.
And it was only later that it was realized that this individual might... misuse such a staff.
The resulting disaster would reflect quite poorly on everyone involved. Are you following me?
Yes, I thought we'd gotten past that bit already.
Onmund's amulet in exchange for my staff.
Look, I traded a staff to someone and found out later that was a bad idea. So, I'd like the staff back. Understand now?
Well, yes. I was completely unaware of the reputation of the other party in this trade.
I don't want that coming back to haunt me.
Regardless, I'm making you a very simple offer. You get me the staff, and I give you Onmund's precious amulet. Do we have a deal?
Finally, we have an agreement.
I look forward to having it back soon. The sooner, the better, in fact.
Oh, good. I was really afraid I'd lose it forever.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Ha! I didn't think he'd really give it back.
Thank you, friend. It's good to know I can count on you.
Actually, yes Arch-Mage. I believe there is.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Solitude.
We've become aware of a problem in Winterhold.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Riften.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Whiterun.

We've been contacted by the Jarl of Dawnstar.
We've been contacted by the Jarl of Falkreath.
It would seem there's some sort of disturbance. From what few details we were given, it sounds quite familiar.
I suspect that the power released by the Eye of Magnus was not fully contained, and has coalesced in this part of Skyrim.
I do hope you still have the Staff of Magnus someplace. I suspect you're going to need it.
There's another report of a disturbance in this Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
There's another report of a disturbance in that Hold. Best if it's taken care of before things get out of hand.
Very good. I'm sure the Jarl will be quite pleased.
Excellent news. Were it to have gotten out of hand, it could have become a major problem for the College.
Ah, excellent. Well, here's the gold the Jarl offered in exchange for taking care of the problem.
Ah, excellent. Well, it's good to know that won't be a problem any longer.
Do you see that?
Some kind of resonance... you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet!
I wonder... what effect might your spells have?
The Words wait.
Use Clear Skies to open the way to Paarthurnax.
Follow me. I will show you how to open the path to Paarthurnax.
Paarthurnax is the only one who can answer your questions about Dragonrend.
I don't have any business with you, so get out of my face.
I can't talk right now.
Yes. Hofgrir took me in when I arrived in Riften about a year ago. He's been teaching me everything he knows.
Horses are my whole life. Back in Hammerfell, I helped my family raise horses at our farm.
I hope to open my own stables one day, but I think it's going to take a lot longer than I expected.
I owe a great deal of money to someone and I think they cheated me. I don't know what to do.
I was able to work out a deal with the stables in Whiterun to sell me some of their tack and harnesses.
I borrowed some gold from Sapphire to pay for the shipment, but it got robbed before it even arrived.
Now Sapphire wants her money back, and if I don't pay her, I think she's going to kill me.
You will?! Oh, thank you!
Not half as sorry as I am.
They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive.
No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum.
I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.
And my Aunt wouldn't have to worry about her daughter.
But we must have the support of the other Jarls for that claim to have any meaning.
Should they accept her rule, we will have peace.
Good man.
Good lass.
If you're looking for truth instead, see Noster. He's a good example of what life has to offer.
And if you're just looking to feel good, go get some Spiced Wine from Evette. But whatever you do, just leave me alone.
But you won't get any better than this from me.

I'm really getting tired of your excuses. When you borrowed the money, you said you'd pay it back on time and for double the usual fee.
I know I did. But how was I to know the shipment would get robbed?
Look, Shadr. Last warning. Pay up or else. All I care about is the gold. Everything else is your problem.

It's not an insult, just an observation.
If I were walking around with a wound, I would want you to tell me to see a doctor.

Who knows how many spies the Empire has sent into our midst already. We're at war. This isn't the time for hospitality.
Thank goodness mother is keeping a level head about everything. If my brother Saerlund had his way, we'd be flying Imperial colors by now.
Can you believe that fool had the audacity to speak of his love for the Empire in the plaza?
He expects us to drop our defenses and greet them with open arms... to dialogue with them rather than defend our homeland by spilling their blood.
He's a traitor, plain and simple. Had I been sitting on the throne, he'd be hanging from the gallows for his sympathies towards the Empire.
Because I did something not a soul in this bloodstained house of war has the backbone to do... dared to speak my mind.
I dared speak of the Empire and the lies that have been spread by Ulfric, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
Now my mother's stripped me of my heritage and incarcerated me here like a common criminal and my brother has all but disowned me.

Ulfric only cares about one thing... Ulfric. He's ordained himself the future High King of Skyrim and steps on anyone that gets in his way.

But at least I know where to start now. Thank you, you've been a great help to me.
I need your help with something. Something private.
Yes, but it needs to be kept quiet.
I may have entered into an... agreement with Enthir. He had something I needed, so I traded him something of mine.
It was a mistake, and now I want back what I gave him. It's an amulet that belonged to my family, and I never should've given it to Enthir.
But he won't deal with me. Talk to him; see what it'll take to get my amulet back.

Very. I helped raise him. Oh, I could not have been more proud to see Torygg on the throne. He made a fine king. A fine king...
Tone changes from conversational to a warning with [QUOTE]... and when one should hold their tongue.[QUOTE]
I was, to my shame. The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day.
Because Ulfric needed a symbol.
Someone he could defeat that represented the Empire, the White-Gold Concordat, the banning of Talos worship.
Torygg's father Istlod had held Skyrim together for nearly twenty-five years. When he died, Torygg became that symbol.
Ulfric showed up at the gates of Solitude requesting an audience.
We thought he was here to ask Torygg to declare independence. By the time we realized Ulfric was here to challenge Torygg... it was already too late.
No. Even after Istlod died, the moot voted to make Torygg High King of Skyrim.
But Ulfric was at that moot, continually talking about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason.
I don't think Ulfric knew how much Torygg respected him for that.
If Ulfric had asked Torygg directly to stand up, to declare independence, Torygg might have done it.
Because the Dominion is a sleeping beast that Skyrim cannot slay alone. Because many Nords are part of the Imperial army even now.
Because the food and resources we get from the Empire are important to our people.
Because even if we can't openly worship him, Talos the god was once Tiber Septim the man, and this is his Empire.
And Torygg wasn't ready to let it fall apart.
By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept.
Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King.
Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day.
When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder.
Not much, to be honest. Their return was a shock to us all. Giraud Gemane has some tomes about them in the library, if you're interested.
That I do. I had a messenger from Dragon Bridge stop here on his way to the Blue Palace, not too long ago.
He was very nervous, mentioned something about needing help.
At times. Jaree-Ra stopped by the other day. Told me to keep an eye out for him, see if any new people arrived in the city.

I still need some help, if you can spare the time.
If you have a moment, could you help me with something?
This will only take me a moment...
We're all trying to become better mages, right?
Well, I need someone I can practice a few spells on. Nothing dangerous, really. Would you be willing to assist me?
I still need someone to practice a few spells on. Interested?
Well, I... I simply thought you might wish to help out one of your fellow mages.
If that's not enough, I suppose... I have this amulet you could take.
No, not that kind of spell. Believe me when I say I wouldn't be asking if it weren't necessary.
relieved
Now, you just stand there...
Please hold still, and don't move.
There! Now, I...
Oh dear. That wasn't supposed to happen.
You have to hold still or this isn't going to work.
Okay, now don't move at all.
shocked, gasp at beginning
trying to undo a spell you've cast
There! All better.
Oh no, that's not it at all.
Let me try again...
This really isn't turning out the way I'd hoped.
But... J'zargo is pleased to see that you are here, and not in pieces!
You are a good friend to have done this. J'zargo will not forget it.
It is true, J'zargo suspected there might be problems. But this is most disappointing.
It is good that you were willing to help J'zargo. This will not be forgotten, friend.
I am so very sorry. I went over this again and again, and I was sure it would have better results.
It's not!
It shouldn't be. You'll be back to normal in no time.
And when you are, we can try this again and I'll be sure to get it right.
I'm not really sure. I think it's just a minor miscalculation on my part.
I'm sure it will wear off soon. When it does, you'll be perfectly fine, and then we can try again.
In the meantime, I'll see about figuring out what went wrong.
Let me see.
say in calming way
Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot?
He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.
A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold.
Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
Gemination = jem-uh-ney-shuhn
If you can locate the quill and return it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider the debt satisfied.
I'm sure you can understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved.
Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself.
I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads.
The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom.
He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful.
Really? I wrote that off a long time ago.
Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.
Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.
But I can't leave here! I'm supposed to watch his house. What do I do?
Oh come on, I ain't that dumb.
Wow, sure is nice of ya'. Here, hang on to the key and don't let anyone in!
yelling off to no one in particular
See ya' round.
concern
I'll watch for Mercer, just get the information we need.
Come on, we need to show the journal to the Guild.
If you find Mercer, give no quarter... kill him and be done with it.
Ha ha! That's funny. Ya' think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.
I don't know how ya' talked Maven into letting me go, and I don't care.
You did something for me, I'm gonna do something for ya'. Here, take the key to Mercer's house. Won't need it any more.
Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks... I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake.
Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.
An old woman can get away with almost anything.
Watch this.
J'zargo sees what you are up to. Very well.
J'zargo awaits word of how well his scrolls work.
I hate it here. Those were my favorite shoes, ruined and for what? We never even made it to the wedding.
You and your wife have been lost for weeks and are arguing and bitter
Just get away from me. We've got nothing left to steal.
I bet the wedding was amazing... and we missed the whole thing.
Leave me alone. I just want to find my way out of this accursed province.
Ugh. It's talking to me.
I hate this place. I hate the trees. I hate the rocks. And I hate the snow.
Clearly you have no idea who I am you or you wouldn't dare approach me.
Yes, that's right.  Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine.
Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion.
Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.
Aye, that I did. I commanded a force of several dozen men, most of them levies from villages in this part of the hold.
I damn near met my end in that war. An Aldmeri soldier ran me through with his blade and left me for dead.
A healer named Jouane saved my life. He's been my closest friend ever since. I tell you, that man is a miracle worker.
Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could.
With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts.
And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men.
The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict. The longer the war goes on, the worse it will be for all for us, I'm afraid.
Have you met Rorik? He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now.
Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see.
We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.
Secret? What makes you think there's a secret?
There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods.
How can we? We're a community of farmers, not fighting men.
If not for the war, we might have enough guards in the hold to protect the settlements. That the dragons should return now is most unfortunate.
Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this?
I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here.
Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere.
In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price.
Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people.
I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.
What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men.
And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos.
Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must.
Equal parts suspicious and scolding.
Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?
These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.
Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day.
That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying.
My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine and grain are all but depleted.
Purchase more supplies, then. That's your job as Steward, isn't it? Why do you trouble me with these details?
My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly.
Our coffers are nearly empty. I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times.
You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus.
awkwardly
They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin - Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids.
I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!

Ha! My opponent is so paralyzed with terror, no words will come. Let's be done with it, then!
I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages.
One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bthardamz for me, but has since lost his way.
I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name.
You cannot eat Gleda! Gleda is protected by Grok!
Hey, who's there?
Unless you've come to pay a ransom, turn around and walk away.
Ah, there you are.
I hope you've readied yourself.
I'm just saying that these ceramic lamps make me nervous. They just seem so... fragile.
Just shut up and play the game.
arrogant, condescending

wistfully - he kind of wishes he could go back
Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.
Yes. They chose me when I was just a lad. It was a great honor, of course. I was to become a Greybeard myself.
I spent almost ten years at High Hrothgar, learning the Way of the Voice. Then the Great War came... I couldn't stand missing it.
I often think about High Hrothgar. It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back.
I suppose the Greybeards care about Skyrim's troubles, in their way, but I needed to do something about it.
I'm sure Arngeir would call it one of my failings.
Yes. The oldest and most powerful, although he may not seem so.
I doubt he's forgiven me for leaving. And for... well, for what he'd consider blasphemy. Using Shouts for anything but worship of Kynareth.
Yes. Although I rarely use my training. The Greybeards believe the Voice should be used only for worship of Kynareth.
I have... fallen from their strict teaching, but I still don't feel it should be used lightly. Not all of Arngeir's lecturing was wasted, it seems.
You're Dragonborn. The rules don't apply to you. You can Shout the way dragons do... without training, through inborn instinct.
They always hope to teach the Dragonborn to respect the Way of the Voice as they do. They never fully succeed.
You'll have to make your own decision. It's a beautiful philosophy, but outside the seclusion of High Hrothgar, I was never able to hold to it.
a little uncomfortable in talking about this
you're really surprised to see a memento from your heyday
You almost can't believe you're saying this.
You're talking to a grown-up, trying to avoid the obvious in front of a child.  Think of Helgen as 9/11
You're a bit gruff at first, like you don't want him around, but you soften up quickly.
when HE was 11 (you are11, too!)
You're not really sad, just stating a fact.
You think your grandfather (Froki) doesn't realize your mom and dad are dead.
your home was destroyed, and you're sad but okay with it.  You know the grown-up is trying to avoid the subject.
I'm looking for a place called Bard's Leap. They say the echo of a song sung from there can be heard all the way in Solitude.
Some may find their inspiration tucked away in tomes, or by carousing in the cities, but I find it here in the vast expanses of Skyrim.
you are a traveling bard performing and looking for stories
Food, experience and a roof over my head in the finest city in Skyrim.
If money's all you hold dear, then you you end up like Jaree-Ra. A plague on the city.
Captain Aldis can't prove it, but that Argonian is up to no good.
Really? I knew he was mixed up in something dangerous, but I hadn't heard he was dead.
Why of course. And will you also be needing the bow that shoots rainbows? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?
Look, if you want arrows we have them, but don't insult my intelligence.
Look for yourself.
Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself.
I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.
Let's see where this goes.
Damn it. No going back that way.
I guess we're lucky that didn't come down on top of us.
I'd rather not tangle with her right now. We might be able to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.
in a whisper
Whew. That was close.
Not the sneaking type, huh?
The Word calls you. Go to it.
Why do you intrude here, if not for tinvaak?
Rotmulaag = word of power
She... She didn't make it.
When it was clear we were going to have to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were all right.
anxious, wondering why no one is charging into battle
Not until we're all ready. We have to go together.
I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
How much worse is this going to get?
We need to get in there and stop this!
Make yourself useful and chop up some firewood. There's a few coins in it for you.
If it's work you need, how about chopping up some wood for the fires?
Here for work? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop.
Honest gold for honest work.
I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.
These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.
I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party.
That was delicious.
This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.
I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.
The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.
With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.
It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.
Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?
You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?
I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?
I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?
I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?
I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?
Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm.
They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.
Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter.
Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful.
Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?
Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day.
Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon.
Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs.
Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.
Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly.
Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.
I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane.
It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me.
After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?
Well, I did see something interesting not long ago.
There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares.
You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.
I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim.
They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating.
They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.
Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true.
I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.
Do enjoy yourself.
I need another drink.
Goodbye, then.
Farewell.
Don't let me keep you.
Until later, then.
May wisdom light your path.
Good speaking with you.
Until next time.
Keep an eye on these Thalmor. You never know...
Come and visit me in Solitude sometime.
It was a pleasure, thank you.
We are traveling to the Shrine of Kynareth in Whiterun. I hear the Gildergreen is more beautiful than ever since it's been restored.
They say that eating the fruit it bears will add years to your life.
You are obviously diseased and cautious of the person who has just approached you.
I am one of the Afflicted. I'd have been dead from this plague a year ago if not for Peryite's protection.
Returning to High Rock. Our shepherd lost his way, and I fear Peryite's wrath may consume those who remain with him.
A touch paranoid, like you expect lighting to strike you any second.
impatiently. You really must be going.
To the player - In a prison cart, noticing the prisoner across from you is awake
Arrogant
Watch your back, friend. Better yet, pay me to do it for you.
Best not to walk the roads of Skyrim alone.
Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you.
The blade can be as lethal as the spell, but deadlier still is the one who wields both!
There's nothing more I can teach you.
You've already learned all I can teach you.
You already know all that I know.
As steward, I serve as an intermediary between the Jarl and her subjects.
I also handle the less important and day-to-day policies that effect daily life in Riften.
Lately I've had my hands full suppressing these ridiculous accusations of corruption in the keep.
you almost said [QUOTE]mother[QUOTE] instead of properly addressing
I run the prisons in Riften, keep the riff-raff from robbing the good folk of this city and have drunks tossed into the lake.
Defense? No one would dare attack Riften. I'm not sure you realize just how well connected Jarl Maven is with the Empire.
With a single snap of her fingers, we could have a legion here in a fortnight.
Indeed. You don't get to the position my mother's achieved by blind luck... her business sense and diplomatic skills are legendary.
If you say so.
I don't care what you think. The Empire put Maven on the throne for a reason. That's all you need to know.
Ulfric's a bloody hero. I don't think there's a worthy Nord alive who'd dare argue the point.
He's taking the Empire to task and making them answer for their crimes.
I don't think I'll be content until Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim with the ashes of the Concordat at his feet.
Hey, if the Empire and the Stormcloaks want to kill each other over some foolish cause, I say let 'em.
All I care about is two things: watchin' Maven's back and countin' the gold she pays me to do it.
Here I'll show you on your map so you can stay away. Please, if you can help me let me know or get out of my way so I can try to find a priest.
Oh, thank the gods. Here, take this with my thanks.
Then get out of my way. I have to get to a town and find a priest.
I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.
I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt.
I want to be on the right side.
I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.
The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.
I may have roots in Cyrodiil, but Skyrim's as much my home as any Nord's.
I've got a message for you from Louis Letrush. This is for double crossing him.
Here. Take a look at this. Some of the Jarl's men came by and left this bounty letter.
If you change your mind, seek me out here.
Cool, demure, but with a trace of gladness.
Familiar, friendly, a bit of ribbing.
Friendly, familiar and enthusiastic. You're seeing an old friend who you're very fond of.
A good-natured ribbing, but laced with arrogance. You are pleased to see an old acquaintance, but you're not going to let him forget that you are awe
You're pleased to see an old acquaintance. The second half of the line is deliberately facetious. There's a bit of familiar ribbing in it.
You're pleased to see an old acquaintance, but you want to remind them that you're also a mecercenary. This is friendly and familiar, but also busine
Business-like, but also friendly.
Jovial, friendly, you're happy to see the player again
I'm what you'd call of soldier of fortune. Make me an offer, and I just might fight at your side.
Can't be too careful these days, with the war and other dangers. For a fair price, I'll watch your back.
If you've got the gold to pay my fee, then my sword-arm is yours.
Some call me a mercenary, but I like to think of myself as a freelance adventurer for hire.
My skill in battle is unmatched. Fortunately for you, that skill can be bought.
Arrogant, condescending
If it's a mercenary you're looking for, you've found him. There's no stronger sword-arm for hire in all Skyrim.
If you're looking to hire the strongest mercenary in Skyrim, I'd wager your search is over.
Sell-swords are common in Skyrim, but you'll find precious few as stout and as a strong as I am.
Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you.
I've fought in more battles than I've got years of life in me. Pay my fee and I'll put that experience to work for you, friend.
I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe.
Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.
By blade or by spell, if you want it dead, I'll make it dead. All you need to do is pay my fee.
Sinister
I fight with both blade and spell. You might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any threat. So, shall we talk price?
Sure, you can hire a swordsman or a spellcaster to fight at your side, but why not get both for the price of one?
Good to see you again! How would you like to hire a brave, if untested, mercenary?
Versatility is the key to survival. Hire me, and you'll be well -prepared to face threats both magical and mundane.
It just feels right somehow, having this new life as an adventurer. It's what I was meant to do.
At first I thought I'd miss farming. I guess I've had my fill of it, because I don't miss it at all.
This new armor fits me like a glove.
If I can make enough money here in Skyrim, I think I'll travel to Hammerfell and see what work I can get there.
Oh, I am well. I will be well. Well to be within the will inside the walls.
You must bring it to Avanchnzel, in the west. Return it to them. It must go back.
I won't be the one to go back there. I won't return to Avanchnzel. You can't make me do it.
Don't forget me next time you need herbs and potions.
Thanks again for finding out about my daughter.
Come by the Winking Skeever any time you want to hear a tune.
You should think about staying the night. Corpulus keeps a clean inn.
Stick around! Still plenty of songs to sing and mead to drink.
Come back if you want to play tag.
Papa doesn't like when I talk to customers, anyway.
Remember the Winking Skeever next time you're footsore.
Need anything, you just say the word.
I was done talking anyway.
Yeah. Next time.
May song speed you along.
May the words of poets keep you warm.
May all your adventures be worthy of telling.
Now you can say you've met the most talented bard in all of Skyrim.
Don't forget my name. Someday, everyone will be saying it.
Glad that distraction's over...
We're done then? Good.
I suppose I should return to my papers...
Always good to talk to a fellow bard.
Farewell, stranger.
Stop by again, sometime. I'll sing for you.
Anytime, friend.
Always time for a fellow bard.
Oh, if you haven't heard Dean Pantea sing, you should.
We should talk again sometime.
Always glad to talk to a bard.
Thanks for taking the time. People never want to talk to me.
Okay, I'll go now.
I'm glad I could help.
Anything I can do.
Always glad to talk to the bard who returned part of the Poetic Edda.
It's been an honor.
I'll get back to court business, then.
Keep your sword arm strong.
Always have your shield at the ready.
Take care of your armor, and it'll take care of you.
I must return to the court. They simply can't make do without me.
Good, we've wasted enough time here.
We'll speak again later. If we must...
I'll be sure to check [QUOTE]Talk to random stranger[QUOTE] off my list of today's tasks...
You are free to leave.
You are excused.
I am done with you. You may go.
Be well. Pray for Solitude and my husband.
Keep the faith. General Tullius will win this war.
We have the utmost confidence in you and Ulfric's guiding hands.
May the blessings of the Eight be with you.
May the blessings of the Nine be with you.
Feel free to return to me with questions. The Blue Palace is an open forum.
Please feel welcome in the court of Solitude.
I won't forget what you've done for Solitude.
Anyone with a stout heart like yours is welcome here.
I'm proud to call a man like you friend.
I'm proud to call a woman like you friend.
Do not dishonor or attempt to harm Elisif in any way. Adhere to that rule, and you'll be fine.
I must return my attention to Elisif. If were were to lose another Jarl while I was... distracted...
Take care of yourself, and always remember: the world is ripe with people looking to spill your blood...
Stay guarded. You never know what could be out there.
All right. Back to slicing, dicing and baking.
Back to my errands.
Don't mess anything up while you're here...
Good talking to you. Not many care to chat with the help.
Okay. I need to get back to the palace soon, anyway.
You can catch me at the Blue Palace later, if you want to talk again.
If Erdi caught me chatting, I'd never hear the end of it...
I guess I should be getting back to work. It was more fun talking, though.
May Arkay bless you with a long life.
May the light of truth keep the darkness at bay.
It's best you leave me be.
Sure, you make your retreat and I'll make mine.
Keep your head about you.
Just watch yourself. You don't want to meet me on the job.
Tell these Horkers to set me free.
Leave me be. I'm no harm here.
Keep my men in your prayers. They'll need them if they don't shape up.
Stay strong. The Eight willing, we'll win this war.
Sure, whatever you say. Bye.
You should speak to my daughter, Evette. She's the brains of the family.
Always good talking to you... friend.
Thanks for talking to me.
For a stranger, you're not so bad.
Blessed are those who worship, for they know true grace.
Keep the faith.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Eight.
The strong and honorable always carry the blessing of the Nine.
Your rewards in life will match the strength of your faith.
The Temple of Divines is always open for worshipers.
Take care, and go with the blessings of the Eight.
Take care, and go with the blessings of the Nine.
I really need to get back to planning my wedding..
Now if you'll excuse me. The East Empire Company has several accounts, and it's up to me to balance them.
Perhaps I'll be seeing more of you.
Please come back if you're ever in need of fletching supplies.
Good to talk to a fellow traveler.
Stop back anytime.
Thank you for helping my Aunt, earlier. I'll see you around.
People to see and places to go, huh? Later, then.
I understand, you're an important person. I'll catch up with you later.
I should make sure Svari is okay.

Come back to Bits and Pieces anytime.
Make sure to recommend us to your associates.

Thank you for your patronage.
I do hope you'll remain in Solitude. This city could do with some new blood.
Remember Radiant Raiment when you need a change of attire.
May you sword feast on Stormcloak flesh.
Good hunting. Go kill some bandits for me.
If you're off to fight, talk to Beirand before you go. His armor is well forged and dependable.
These are troubled times. Be on your guard out there.
May the gods speed your journeys... and steady your sword arm.
Come back when you figure out how to spend money.
I'll always have fruit to buy. Until it goes rotten. Then... I won't.
Good luck out there. It seems like a tough time to be wandering Skyrim.
Stay warm and keep sober. It's the two things I know for sure will make life better.
If you're heading up to Solitude you should stop to check out the view on your way. It's a good one.
Carriages to all the cities in Skyrim. Don't forget us.
A man like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.
A woman like you should own a horse. Go speak with my husband.

I want to check on Grani, one of our horses. Goodbye, stranger.
You really don't know?
He let Ulfric Stormcloak escape Solitude. Ulfric rides in, murders the High King and Roggvir lets him ride right back out.
He opened the gate for Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric rides in, defeats the High King and Roggvir was the one that let him ride right back out.
Not my finest hour. Roggvir was a fine and honorable man.
No. I think he was entirely wrong. Roggvir's execution was justified and necessary.
Being honorable might make you a good man, but it doesn't make you right. Be a better world if it did.
Sometimes you just do what needs to be done. You don't have to hate a man to kill him.
Though, admittedly... it helps.
This city has a long history of madness and murder. The Wolf Queen... Pelagius... The death of High King Torygg... And now, public executions.
My books tell the stories. Have no doubt - as pretty as its streets are, as jovial as the bards may be... darkness is drawn to Solitude.
You mean Roggvir. Yes. I made an appeal to Captain Aldis. He allowed Roggvir to have a proper Nord burial, as is the custom in Solitude.
Depends on what you mean by [QUOTE]busy.[QUOTE] I'm also the head jailor in the dungeon here. Quiet job, usually.
Ain't got one. But I'd fancy a chance at that Jaree-Ra's scrawny neck.
Filthy Argonian never would have set foot in this city, if High King Torygg was still alive. I can tell you that.
Can any man hope to be ready for a dragon?
I can but hone their skills and harden their hearts. The rest is up to the gods.
You're the Dragonborn aren't you?
I'm sort of hoping you're going to fight the dragons for us. A normal man is no match for a dragon.
Dragon?
Really? Was it big? Did it breath fire?
Oh, wow. I knew it. I knew they were real! I have to remember to tell papa.
Then like Roggvir, you're a Nord at heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.
I think Aldis understands. I don't think I could have stayed here if anyone else had...
I... I think I need to stop talking now...
Roggvir. He opened a gate and they executed him for it.
He opened a gate and the wrong man rode out of it. If that man hadn't been Ulfric Stormcloak. If Ulfric hadn't killed High King Torygg...
emphasize [QUOTE]was[QUOTE]
So now he's dead.
Then you didn't know Roggvir, and you have no idea what it means to be a Nord of Skyrim!
He did the honorable thing, even when he knew it would cost him everything.
My brother was the best man in Solitude.
Then like Roggvir, you have a Nord's heart. It's hard for many of the people here to understand.
I... I think I need to be done talking for the moment.
Where the Dragon attacked?
We've heard rumors of death and... and fire from the skies. But no real news.
Then we should soon be selling arrows by the bushel. A sword is no good against a dragon.
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man steers clear of Stentor.
And keeps himself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart woman steers clear of Stentor.
And keeps herself out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...
Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities.
Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.
Let's just say the headsman's axe may not be the worst way for a Solitude Jail prisoner to die.
Look at that. I've told you to watch your tongue and mine is waggling. I've said enough.
If you're looking for a good attitude go see the Bards. They'll fake it for you if nothing else.
Listen, Roggvir and I grew up together. It was us, a few others and Vivienne. Vivienne Onis.
I have no idea why, but one day, I told Roggvir I liked her. It was a stupid thing to do... He mocked me incessantly after that.
From that point forward, every time Vivienne and I were anywhere close to each other, he made sure to humiliate me.
He'd beat me up, dump mead on my head, anything he could get away with. Once he even slipped a beehive into my bed.
We were children, sure. But Roggvir never outgrew that immaturity, or his cruelty. So any talk about him being an [QUOTE]honorable[QUOTE] Nord? Pure folly.
Work in it? I own it.
You could say that. I own the place.

I would not have expected a scholar of such an esoteric turn of mind among their ranks.
Hmm. Well, if that's what the Greybeards told you, I confess I don't have a better plan.
So little is known about the Elder Scrolls, almost anything is possible where they're concerned. Artifacts of truly inconceivable power.
Do you know the College of Winterhold? They have a deep interest in such arcana.

You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.
That's a fair price. My blade is yours.

You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow.
What dangers and wonders shall we discover in the frozen wastes? I can hardly wait to find out!
Enthusiastic.
Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Like to see him laugh his way out that.

Truly? So maybe my mother isn't crazy after all.
You had best tell the Jarl in Whiterun. He needs to know about this.
I see no harm in it, if you have the skill.
The grindstone will improve your weapons. Use the table to improve your armor.
If you've got the raw materials, you can use the forge to make something new.

pirate attack yell
It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well.
I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest.
Born and raised right here in Rorikstead.
My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family.
My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own.
It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone.
Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms.
A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon.
As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford.
Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread.
This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those that align themselves with Thalmor interests.
Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it.
But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.
I've spent most of my life as a trader. I've got a stake in several shipping ventures across Tamriel, mostly imports and exports.
I made a lot of friends in a lot of ports, and the Thalmor approached me with a generous offer.
I give them access to my business associates, and they keep my coffers full.
I trust them completely, because I understand them.
When the Thalmor want something, they tell you straight. In my experience, they have no interest in subtleties and innuendo.
So if one of them says they're going to do something, I believe them. When you can just take what you want, there's no need to lie.
A delicate question, to be sure. I'm the Emperor's cousin, and the Empire has little love for the Thalmor.
On the other hand, the Thalmor have considerable funds and are looking to expand their shipping.
I haven't signed any deals yet, but I'm sure my cousin will want a cut if I do. What better way to soothe his wounded pride?
We have a relationship of mutual respect.
I care little about the politics and rivalries between the Thalmor and the Empire.
But I do respect power, and the Thalmor have that. They leave me alone, and I leave them alone.
This line is spoken in a low voice, almost a whisper, so it cannot be heard by those within earshot. There should be a suggestion of annoyance. and i
Have you learned nothing about me? I have dealings with everyone.
Annoyed and dismissive.
I lead the Justiciars. We are charged with enforcing the ban on Talos worship.
Nords can be quite stubborn. They're slow to change their ways, and we find more heretics every day.
But mark me well -- I will purge the heresy from this land as surely as the flame burns the flesh from the bone.
There is peace now, and that peace will continue for as long as it suits our needs.
But make no mistake, this is not a peace forged out of necessity between rival nations of equal strength.
It is more like the calm between storms. And the next storm, I think, will be far deadlier than the last.
That's putting it mildly.
The Thalmor invite me here to remind everyone that they can tell the Empire what to do.
I would refuse, but I don't want to jeopardize the peace between us.
Elenwen is a formidable woman. She lacks for neither cunning nor ambition.
Now that I think of it, she would have made a fine Imperial general.
Annoyed.
Annoyed, sarcastic.
Exasperated, annoyed

A bit nervous and nebbish
I'm the Steward of Whiterun. I serve Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach.
Nervous, nebbish
Surprised.
Yes, I am indeed. Elenwen always serves the best wine at her parties. The food is excellent as well.
Go ahead and play your little joke.
Happy, but a little bit melancholy as well.
Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!
I could learn a lot from the people in this room.
Have you tried the wine?  It's better than anything in the Blue Palace.
Very much so, yes.
Elewen's parties are always so elegant. She really has impeccable taste.
My only regret is that she doesn't host them more often.
I beg your pardon?
You must have me mistaken for someone else. I am Elisif, widow of High King Torygg and Jarl of Solitude.
Lucky for you, I possess a forgiving nature and I'm not easily insulted.
Why, thank you. You are most courteous.
I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. Normally these parties are reserved for  the Jarls and business leaders of Skyrim.
Elenwen must be very fond of you.
I've got this. Do what you need to do.
We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.
I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim.
These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength.
Not well at all, and I'm happy to keep it that way.
What is more, I'm away from the hold at a time when there are dragons and Stormcloaks on the loose.
You asked for my help. Not for nothing, I hope?
These Thalmor know how to treat a guest.
A ruler is entitled to luxury, don't you think? The Thalmor understand that.
Why would anyone join the Stormcloaks? They have a fraction of the Empire's wealth and power.
Stuck-up, condescending
I've known her long enough to appreciate her excellent taste in food and wine.
And also long enough to respect her importance to Skyrim. She plays a vital role in rooting out the forbidden worship of Talos.
As far as I'm concerned, those Talos-worshippers get what they deserve. All they do is cause problems for me and the other Jarls.
Yes, I know what you mean. Most Nords struggle to accept change.
Those who fought the Thalmor in the Great War still see an enemy. But that war is over, and a new day has dawned.
Besides, the Thalmor reward their friends richly. Anyone who doesn't take advantage of that is a stubborn fool.
Be about your business, while I'm about mine.
Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders.
It is not eyes that reveal another's true nature. It is the heart.
If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgement and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber.
There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages.
Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing.
For this reason, I avoid them when I can.
I'm doing as you asked. This is for some good purpose, yes?
A Jarl has many duties. Attending parties isn't the most important one, but neither is it unpleasant.
Take advantage of the fine food and drink. Such things have been scarce since the war began.
I came here hoping to learn that more Imperial reinforcements were on their way to Skyrim, but so far I've been disappointed.
I admit, I've never felt entirely at ease in the Thalmor embassy.
Well enough, I suppose.
Elenwen puts a great deal of effort into these parties, and it shows.
I just wonder what her real motivations are. That woman is inscrutable.
For now, perhaps. But I've heard disturbing rumors that they're marshalling their strength.
I suspect the treaty that ended the war was just a tactic to buy time so the Thalmor can rebuild their armies.
I hope I'm wrong. I'm not sure the Empire can afford another war.
Polite, gracious
Cordial, but a bit frosty. You're at a party, but you don't really want to be there. Still, you are trying to be polite.
Polite, satisfied
We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?
Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?
Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.
Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.
We've had the same troubles.
I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.
With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.
We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.
These are troubling times, indeed.
I just try to keep out of the way when they start roughhousing.
Don't mind them. Just working out some issues, in the old way.
Little blood to clear the air. Hope you have the stomach for it, outsider.

Not now, I'm trying to watch this!

Are you going to let me watch, or not?
Look at the young ones scrap!
Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed.

Good fight going, here.
There are more books to be recovered and secured in the Arcanaeum.
All right. I wrote down the last place I'd heard about. Don't get killed.
Some other time, then.
Looks like you're still in one piece. And more importantly, so is the book. Thank you.
They're not the sort to take visitors, but I never go that high up the path anyway.
Some folk who make the trip leave them food or other essentials, but not to make conversation.
I'm walking the 7,000 Steps to honor the Greybeards and reflect on my own life. It's a tradition among the Nords of Skyrim.
I like to spend time up here. Walk the Steps, meditate on the emblems. Doesn't hurt when I bag some game along the way.
You aren't being cruel, but prefer to be left alone. Gruff.
Walking the Steps. Meditating on the emblems. I make this trip every few years.
Just a pilgrim. I'd prefer to leave it at that, if you don't mind.
I was just outside Ivarstead when it happened. It's an exciting moment. Nothing like this has happened in centuries.

In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.
Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own.
The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland.
The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves who ended up betraying them.
This betrayal made them what they are now... horrible blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.
Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.
Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals... they show absolutely no pity or remorse.
Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged.
If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table.

Well then, it's too bad my wife is already taken.
Yes, it's a great shame. Gods willing, I'll find someone just like her one day.
Mind you don't forget to sweep up, Julienne. The floor's looking a bit dusty.
I won't forget. I'll do it after I get the dishes cleaned.
You've been working hard lately. You'll make a fine innkeeper someday.
If the Nine are willing!
Miss Faida, may I ask you a question?
Of course, Julienne. What's on your mind?
What do you do when a customer can't afford to pay for a meal or a drink?
Since my customers are mostly local, I just knock on their front doors the next day.
Ari gave me this dagger when we first started hunting together. Always said it brought her luck. You should be the one to carry it now.
Thank you again for all the help.
This is fun.
Sometimes I just like to watch them burn.
You look strong.
Leave me to my work. Unless you plan to stay and help?
Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me.

Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together.
Listen, wench, we're on to you. We know who you are, so you'd better come with us right now!
I don't know who you think I am, and I don't care. Leave me alone!
I don't have time for this foolishness. Now come along quietly and we won't have to get rough.
Brother, I think she's telling the truth...
I'm not going anywhere.  Now back off before I do something drastic.
She doesn't have the scar.
What? Oh... you're right.
We've made a mistake. Now move along before that mouth of yours gets you into trouble.
Next time you're looking to pester someone, make sure it's the right person!
Foreigners. What a nuisance!
They thought I was some other Redguard woman! They just wouldn't leave me alone. I hope they get lost in the wilderness.
Don't bother me, peasant. I've had a long journey and paid too much coin on these gifts to be late to Vittoria's wedding.
Indeed. If we ever get there.
What? No! Guard, help!
Ugh. Speak to my husband if you must.
Get away from me, you Skyrim trash.
Hello there fellow, traveler. One itinerant minstrel and wandering wastrel, at your service.
Hello there, friend. How lucky for you to chance upon a bard on the road.
Ah, smell that fresh air? Truly, this is a good place to play a song.
The life of adventure and song is the life for us, eh friend?
you are a thug about to attack an npc
No, how did you find me? Just give me more time, I can pay Maven back!
You! You must have told Maven about the horse. If you'd just stuck to the plan, I wouldn't be in this mess.
This has nothing to do with you, so back off.

The Silver Hand. They finally had the nerve to attack Jorrvaskr. We got most of them, but I think a few stragglers made it out.
Don't leave any of them alive.

Name's Valdr. I hunt out of Falkreath.
We tracked a bear to this den. Good coin for those pelts. We had the big sow cornered when they showed up. Three of them, out of nowhere.
Spriggans is spat out with disgust. Speaking about recent death of friends.
Understatement, trying to grin through pain. Maybe hiding a cough or strain.
I'll give them a proper burial, then head back. Come find me if you're ever in Falkreath. You'll always be welcome at my door.
Relieved
But now what? I can't just walk away. Not with my friends' bodies in there, being torn apart by those beasts.
You should have acted. They're already here.
The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
Their defeat was merely a delay.
To the time after Oblivion opened.
When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
But no one wanted to believe. Believe they even existed.
And when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire.
But, there's one they fear.

Hey Ton, you shouldn't cheat on Vekel. He's a good guy.
What are you talking about?
Come on, everyone knows about you and Brynjolf.
Well, everyone's wrong. Now why don't you just shut up about it.
I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years.
I just got lucky is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.
If you like I'd be happy to take it over the operation for you. Take the source off your hands.
And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.
The only thing keeping me from having you killed is Brynjolf. He's stepped in and made amends.

Father, how come Olda's so mean to everyone? She's only ever happy when she's with Lodvar, and she's not even married to him!
That's no business of yours, son. Mind you keep your nose out of it.
Annoyed at being dismissed by his father.
Did you read that letter from Markarth yet?
Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent.
And how is that old warrior doing these days?
Not well. He's convinced that his house is haunted, so he's sleeping on the street.
Oh dear. I wish there was something we could do to help him.
As do I. That man saved my life. I hope that someone helps him, as he once helped me.
Haven't you got some chores to do?
Papa says I'm not old enough yet, so I help out by patrolling the town with Lucky here.
Your father's too easy on you, boy. I'd have you cutting wood at dawn if you were my son.
Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say.
It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested.
Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat.
It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...
Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out.
Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.
I warned them it might be dangerous. It's not my fault they didn't listen.
As long as the Synod don't blame us for this mess, I have more pressing matters to deal with.
I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things.
I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power.
The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.
I knew you'd come eventually.
It would seem I'm bound to this place. The bitter irony of it all -- my greatest failure, and even in death I can't escape it.
I never meant for any of what happened here. Tried to seal it up, lock it away forever.
But now it all comes out again...
There were six of us. Full of ambition, eager to conquer the world.
It was Atmah's idea to come here, at first. She talked me into it, and I convinced the others.
We were sure we'd find it all here, hidden away from time. Power, knowledge... All the things we didn't want to wait for.
We thought it would be so simple.
Girduin died first. It happened so fast, none of us had a chance to react.
One moment we joked about what we'd find below, the next he'd been ripped in half.
And then we were all fighting just to survive. None of us were prepared. It was amazing the rest of us survived.
When it was over, Atmah, Hafnar and I stared, pale-faced, at one another, unwilling to admit we'd made a terrible mistake.
We could have turned back. It could have ended there. But we kept going.
Elvali died here. I don't even remember what killed her. One of the countless faceless horrors. I think she was glad, in that final moment.
Hafnar was covered in blood, but his stupid Nord pride wouldn't let him admit defeat.
I... I don't know why I pressed the others on, convinced them to keep going.
[QUOTE]If we can just make it through, it'll all be worth it[QUOTE], I told them. And the fools believed the words I myself didn't trust.
There were only three of us left. Takes-In-Light just sat down and gave up, and we left her there to die.
I've no idea what killed her, but I'm sure something did.
Atmah cried to herself. Hafnar wouldn't look at either of us. And I kept telling them it would be all right.
I was in charge now. I pushed them on, insisting it would be worse to try and go back.
What happened after was my fault. All mine.
We all knew this was the end. Without even opening the door, we knew what was behind it would kill us.
None of our spells were potent enough, none of our wills were strong enough.
[QUOTE]No matter what, we stay together[QUOTE], Hafnar said. I looked him in the eyes and lied to him.
I had no choice, don't you see?
I had to leave them behind, had to sacrifice them so I could make it out alive.
If we'd all died there, if we'd loosed the thing on the world, who knows what might have happened?
That's how I consoled myself for years, after I'd sealed this place shut and vowed never to let anyone open it.
Now you've put it all to rest, but it can't undo my mistakes. They can never be undone...
Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!
Are we truly sure this is a good idea?
We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.
joking
Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with.
Let's just get inside, see what's in there.
excited, nervous
Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?
You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.
Given the history of this place, it's more than likely there's still some amount of power here.
excited
And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?
Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.

Gods, what have we done?

Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.
What was that thing, anyway?
Who in their right mind would be stupid enough to pay you to steal from Maven?
Whoa, lad. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?
Whoa, lass. I'd do just as well drawing a blade across my own neck. Where did this foolish request come from?
Guess I should have known. Maven and Sibbi have been at odds ever since she had him tossed into jail.
Look, if I were you, I'd proceed carefully. Crossin' Maven is one of the first things you learn not to do when you're down here.
As far as the Guild's concerned this is between Sibbi and Maven, so we're going to officially stay out of it.
Look, this sounds like a family matter and I don't want the Guild in the middle of it. You do what you want.
Just don't expect us to at your back when Maven has your head on the executioner's block.
ready to brawl
You know, I've heard the Gourmet is in Skyrim right now...
I can't believe I just met the Gourmet!
I'm on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Azura, the Goddess of Twilight. If you'll excuse me.
In the mountains to the northeast. I'll mark it on your map.
It is the Champion of Namira! I was just about to eat. Here, you should have the first bite.
You were helpful before. I have need of your help again, if you're willing.
You may have seen the open grave in our graveyard. Most of the townsfolk think it's the work of a corpse thief.
The truth is less pleasant. It is...was, the grave of Vighar, my own ancestor, dead for centuries now.
He is also a vampire. My family is entrusted with keeping him buried, but recently someone stole the wardstone, and Vighar escaped.
Destroy Vighar, my long dead vampire ancestor. Have you changed your mind?
No. It's too late for the wardstone. Vighar must be destroyed. If this gets out, my family will suffer great shame.
Good. He will have fled to gather others of his kind.
Start with a heavy sigh.
My family thanks you. Take this as a token of our gratitude.
She's here? By Sithis, I thought we'd lost her. Let's go!
Oh! Well in that case, lead on. I'm right behind you.
Damn it, there's got to be a way out of here!

The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus's former position as Guild Master.
Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.
I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone.
Fortunately, I persevered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim.
The infighting had taken months to subside which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks.
I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished... like I said before, she was the best.
You are about to kill the player.
regret
I made a split second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.
More than you'll ever realize. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.

The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot and yet I used it on you.
I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot.
Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus's murder.
All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.
My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake.
sound crestfallen as you say this
I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.

relieved an idea was discovered
There were three of us. Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were a anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften.
Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation.
Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey.
You dare to betray us, Illia?
Our sisterhood will be better off with you dead, brat.
passionate curator explaining an exhibit
Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it... less so.
You see, Pelagius' mother was... well... let us say [QUOTE]unique.[QUOTE] Although, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for a Septim.
That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right...
Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very early age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone.
The objective here is simple, you simpleton!  Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same!
Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out.
The butler did it! Or is it the advisor? Whoever that man behind the throne was.
With the threat gone Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him... sort of. And we're that much closer to home.
Well now, that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time.
You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age.
He would lie in bed, paralyzed with fear, imagining his own nightmares coming to life. Ooohhh... Scary.
All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel... but persistent.
Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel...
But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself.
The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest part of his fragile self.
The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance.
Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself... and continue hating everyone else.
Don't get too comfortable here, mortal. You may actually earn your way out.
Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised.
Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this.
Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this.
Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight.
Then I guess that's your last request, fool!
Speaker is clearly shaken from the previous line
Nice try, but you don't scare me.
No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind.
Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold.
Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.
Good luck out there!
A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies.
Come along, no more stops, we need to find our way to Solitude.
Why are we even going to a wedding at this far flung end of the Empire anyway?

Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed.
Ha! Humor is often in short supply here.
But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that.

Normally you'd need to show some aptitude with one of the schools of magic, but you...
I think there is much that we can learn from each other.
I'm afraid your skills haven't improved enough to be considered.
I think you'll be a superb addition to the College. Welcome, Apprentice.
I'll lead you across the bridge. Once you're inside you'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine, our Master Wizard. Please, follow me.
We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to the study of the arcane.
There are others who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret.
No, not recently at least.
We don't mistake that for acceptance, though. Odds are they're simply too afraid to confront us directly.
And most of us are quite satisfied with that.
Tell me as soon as you've given Camilla the letter.
That letter ought to convince Camilla to never speak to Faendal ever again.
Faendal thinks he can woo Camilla Valerius away from me. She's already mine, I keep telling him.
Here she is.
If that's how you choose to end your life, so be it.
Fjotra!
Now, come with me, child. We'll prepare you for the goddess's presence.
Maybe you could help find it, I just know it's in here.
Some old priest buried here long ago.  I've been searching for his tomb for a few years now.
It's probably meaningless to you, but according to family legend it links our bloodline back to Ysgramor himself.
Hmm, it's encrypted.  It'll take a while to figure this out.
And here's a little something for helping me out.
I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.
That museum is a mistake.
slightly drunk, boisterous
Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure.
under breath aloud
Sorry, what was that?
Nothing Vulwulf.... cheers.
Hey, hey. Sorry. I just get jealous when I hear rumors about you.
Tonilia, can I offer some friendly advice?
You can offer, but I may not buy.
Why don't you just formally join up? Quit sittin' here wheelin' and dealin' when you could be out there makin' a heck of a lot more coin.
We could use someone with your skills.
Thanks for the compliment, Delvin. I may just take you up on that one day.
Speaking to herself
Every moment you waste is another moment those doors stay shut tight. Get going!
Only one more door left.  Hurry up.
I don't have time to talk. Keep moving!
Clear out the chamber, and I'll give you the key.
Yes!  The path is clear!
Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden you know.
This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up.
So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time.
I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?
I thought we had a guard posted outside.
We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.
Anything?
No, haven't seen anyone.
Keep looking. Someone's here, I can feel it.
Don't wait for me. Get to Korvanjund as soon as you're ready. I'll meet you there.
You have your orders. Rendezvous with the rest of the men outside Korvanjund.
What did you need, soldier?
Good work! Lucky we had you with us today.
Must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
Draugr. Dammit. I hate those things.
Be careful, friend. This place doesn't seem too... forgiving.
Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to set the rings so the door will open.
Stick close. This place gives me the creeps.
All for some old crown? It's a strange war all right.
The Stormcloaks will never stop us.
So far so good.
See if you can unlock that door.
Did you find a key? See if it unlocks that door.
Unlock that door and let's get out of here.
Talen, do you believe what they're saying? Do you really think the dragons have returned?
I don't know what to believe. If it's true, then dark times may be upon us.
What should we do?
We hold each other close and hope that all of this ends well.
Madesi, have you heard the Imperials might be headed this way? What would we do?
They aren't invading, milord... it's simply a response to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. I assure you everything will be fine.
But I've heard from the Snow-Shods that they intend to burn this place to the ground!
Tythis, please. The Snow-Shods are good people, but tend to exaggerate. Try and stay calm for your own sake.
Have our scouts come up with any information on these reports of dragons?
Yes, milady. That unpleasantness at Helgen supposedly involved a dragon. It killed several soldiers before it departed.
I want you to speak to the city guard. Make sure there's a contingency plan in effect in case Riften falls under attack.
Yes, milady. I've also taken the liberty in preparing a private carriage... just in case.
Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared.
Disembodied voice raising the dead
Do you think we could persuade one of the dragons to join our side?
I'm fairly sure that the dragons don't care about our matters one way or the other.
But just think of the advantage.
I'm not saying it wouldn't be useful. But there are better uses of our resources right now.
I don't suppose we would ever really trust the thing anyway.
Captain, have you heard these stories of dragons?
Elda, you know better than to believe every idiot traveler that wanders through.
But they're saying that one of them freed Ulfric... that he's in league with them.
Think about how ridiculous that sounds. Come now.
Calixto, do you know if there's any truth to these rumors of dragons?
Eh. I try not to trouble myself with stories of the outside world.
Now if someone brings me a dragon scale, that's a different story.
But how would you know it's real?
Ah, I can't reveal all my secrets to you. But rest assured, I would know.
And that's exactly what the old man wanted. I'm glad we could give it to him.
He's not a werewolf any more? Even dead? This is a good thing!
Yes, you brought honor to him, even after his death. A worthy outcome for a worthy warrior.
I'll be honest, I wouldn't have expected it.
But that may just be because I remember when you were just a whelp who was begging to join.
The old man trusted you, so I'll trust you.
Oh, you don't have to worry about any problems from me. I do what I'm told. Congratulations!
If you had told me a few months ago that some outsider I had never heard of would lead the Companions, I might have slit your throat.
But I've seen what you can do. And heard of the love that Kodlak had for you. The trust.
Let's hope you can show that his heart was not deceived. Good luck, my friend.
Eventually. But this... this is the Tomb of Ysgramor. I think I'm just going to... commune for a bit.
This place is worthy of some time. You go on ahead. I'll see you back there.
I go where my brother goes. I think he wants to look around some more.
Not right now. I'm going to look at some of these carvings. I wonder if Ysgramor ever set foot here while he was alive.
But you don't have to stay, if you don't want to. I'll see you back at Jorrvaskr. Stories to tell the others, eh?
You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader.
And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm.
And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.

Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here.
I can't explain the details. That would be giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years.
Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details.
What's important is that all of this work was designed to reveal to us sources of great magical power.
Purely to help safeguard the Empire, of course.
And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College.
The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian.

It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that.
Oh, my! You? It is an honor! Your food has opened my eyes to the wonders this world can hold.

This is... he should not have gone alone.
Thank you for telling me. This is a day where our souls must cry, and our hearts will answer.
Go. Grieve in whatever way you know.
Skjor... I always thought of him as invincible.
Truly, one of our great fires has gone out.
He was the one I looked up to. I need to find my brother.
He has joined the honored dead. This will be a difficult time for us all.
Unfortunate. He was an excellent sparring partner. I'll miss our training sessions.
I... I can only imagine Aela's anger. I'll make sure not to cross her for a while.
He did? That's... I'm surprised.
I wonder who will replace him in the Circle?
Tragic, of course.
But, well. Fires go out. Others ignite. Skjor inspired many with his life. Perhaps his death can continue to inspire.
Oh my. He was always so kind to me. A bit rough around the edges, but a good man.
I... I'll get his things in order.
That's it! You've got one of them lined up!
Pretty, pretty flesh. Let me out!
Almost there! We're so close!
You've done it! That's all of them!
So, what is it? What have you done?
Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing?
Well, explain yourself!
Heart of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Forsworn...

I will grant you my understanding of Clear Skies. This is your final gift from us, Dragonborn. Use it well.
No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it.
What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.
Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated?
Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it.
If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.
recollecting yourself from a surge of anger
But heed my warning - the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.
No. Not now. Not until you return to the path of wisdom.
Do not confuse inaction with indifference. Often the wisest course is to wait and watch events unfold, until the time to act is clear.
The Blades have never followed that path, of course.
Those who are ignorant find the Way of the Voice easy to ridicule.
This is why so few follow it, and why the world is as it is.
in ground-shaking Greybeard rumble
Dragonborn... wait.
I cannot teach you the Shout, because I do not know it.
reluctantly
We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.
He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.
But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began.
Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.
I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story.
Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.
I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.
Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.
Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we?
Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods.
mock friendliness
As far as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know.
Now you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?
Look, did you want the information or not?
Do take care handling that case of wine... it's irreplaceable.
If you're the best the Guild's got, they're in worse shape than I imagined.
I need you to put all your efforts into this job. We can't afford any mistakes.
Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are.
You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible.
But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.
Knowledge of truly powerful Illusion spells is here at the College, but it is hidden from those who might misuse it.
I shall teach you a spell to discern things hidden from others. With it, you will be able to acquire the texts you need.
Bring all four to me, and I shall use them to inscribe the spells for you.
I continue to hear things about dragon sightings in Skyrim.
Dragons? Well, that's fascinating. We should have someone look into that.
Would you like me to send someone? Faralda or Phinis, perhaps?
I'll think about it.
Is it true? Are there really dragons in Skyrim?
There's talk of it, but I find it hard to believe.
lost in thought, greedy sounding
Opportunities for what?
What? Oh, nothing. It's just... It's an interesting development.
You haven't heard any more about dragon sightings, have you?
No, which is fine with me.
A pity. You have any idea how much fangs would be worth? Or even better -- bottle their flame. The right buyer would pay an immense amount.
Bottle... their flame? I can't... No, I don't think I've any interest in that sort of thing.
Folks have gone missing the past few weeks. Word now's that our hunters are gone, too.
Say, if you're traveling, could you keep an eye out for them? Valdr and his men. I think they were after bear up north.
I just need a little to get going.
Thank you. Please hurry!

Now that this is a Black-Briar Meadery, you can be sure that we'll be selling only the best mead in Skyrim.
What's left of the Honningbrew has been dumped into the sewers. Good riddance.
Maven Black-Briar always remembers her friends. That's why I'm in charge of the place.
If you have anything you're having a hard time selling, I can take it off your hands.
It was you, wasn't it. I should of known better. Now look at me.
You've sent an innocent man to jail. I hope your proud of yourself.
Maven be damned. One day, she'll get hers. I can promise you that.

An alchemy lab, it could be in here.  It's worth a look.

I'm just itching for a fight.
I ain't scared of nothin'.
I've never felt this brave.
Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.
Bah! Is there no one who can offer a challenge?
I've never been more ready!
My claws are sharp. My will to kill... unquenchable.
I cannot be beaten!
I may be old, but I can show 'em a trick or two.
I'm ready. Let's go!
Hmph. Everyone seems so insignificant now.
I'm ready. More than ready.
Come on! Let's go.
I feel... unbeatable.
By the gods, I feel like I could crush a giant's head like a walnut.
Ha ha! Look out. Here I come!
There is none who can stand in my way.
Come on, I can take anyone. And that ain't just the mead talkin'.
I feel like I can beat anyone.
Even my claws feel sharper.
By Ysmir, I feel... invincible!
Been too long since I've embraced my rage...
Just point me to the fight.
I fight and I'll win. Simple as that.
I feel like I can take on all of Skyrim.
If you need to sample some of the finest mead in Skyrim, you're in the right place.
If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the owner, Sabjorn.
If you're looking to purchase any mead, speak to the brewmaster, Mallus.
We're a small meadery, but growing quickly. Sabjorn's only been running this place for a short time now and look at it.
It's a shame the Black-Briar Meadery took this place over. I never liked it as much as our Honningbrew.
Mallus is teaching me everything he knows about brewing. Hopefully, I can take over his position some day.
Welcome. I'm the owner and proprietor of Honningbrew Meadery.
Honningbrew uses only the finest natural honey, not that sludge you'll find at Goldenglow Estate.
We may be small, but what we lack in size we make up for in quality.
Black-Briar Mead is just fine, if you need something to wash the dirt off a riding horse's hooves.
You need something to do, or you just enjoy slowing down the hard-working folk?
If you want to buy something, go find Sabjorn. Otherwise, piss off.
To tell you the truth, Sabjorn isn't much of an owner. Slave driver, sure.
I've never met someone like him that revels so much in other's misery.
very pleased with self
The parchment you recovered mentions a [QUOTE]Gajul-Lei.[QUOTE] According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts.
His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.
Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude.
I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer.
Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions.
They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm impressed it reached this point.
Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
However, don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.
When Gulum-Ei was getting us merchandise from the East Empire Company, we were making a hefty profit.
It was so lucrative, I was considering moving the Guild to Solitude to save us time.
Gulum-Ei started to get greedy and cut us out of the deal. Almost can't say I blame the scaly bastard.
It started out innocent enough; he kept claiming the shipments were light because of Imperial interference.
Then, maybe a few years ago, it all stopped. He didn't even bother to contact us anymore.

I was kidnapped by these bandits weeks ago. They locked me up in the towers near Mistwatch.

They're at Mistwatch. Here, let me show you on your map....
If you can stop them, you'll be a true hero!

Years of work, finally going to pay off...
...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be.
Something is creating an incredible amount of interference.
Something in Winterhold, it looks like.
What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?!
Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made.
Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it.
You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already.
There should be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is even more sub-standard than I've heard.
You'll have to get the crystal to focus properly. Heat and cold will affect it; simple concentration spells should be enough.
You'll also need to align the mirrors using the controls up above. Once everything is lined up, the light will reflect back through the crystal.
Then you'll see some real magic.
Place the crystal in the center of the armillary. Then we can worry about attuning it.
Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job.
The only grownups who talk to me are the kind I don't want talking to me.

You're going to end up helping me. I know it.
Kind of nice being in on the secret, itsn't it.
Father says I'm too young to train with a sword, so I practice with my fists!

I used to dream of it. In the dream, I was standing... someplace high up... a tower, or mountain.
It was always just before dawn. The whole world was in darkness.
Then came the flash of light - just on the horizon, within the clouds that mark the border between worlds.
It could have been lightning, but there was no thunder. In the dream, the sense of foreboding grew, but I could never wake up.
Then it came again, this time more distinct. Closer. Definitely not lightning now. It was orange - brilliant orange, the color of hearth and dawn.
And a sound, too. Distinct and indistinct. Not thunder... something else. Something I should recognize, but in the dream I cannot place it.
I want to leave my high place, to seek shelter. From what, I don't yet know.
In the manner of dreams, I cannot escape. I'm forced to wait and watch.
Then, finally, realization and horror arrive together. The orange is flame, heat. The sound a roar, a challenge in their ancient tongue.
But now it's too late for escape. The dragon is upon me - fire and darkness descending like a thunderbolt.
And not just any dragon, but the Dragon - Alduin, the World-Eater, the dragon who devours both the living and the dead.
And then I would wake up. And hope that it was just a dream... but know that it was not.
Speak to Vex. We have nothing else to talk about.
The Guild will not tolerate the kind of behavior you've been displaying. Too much is at stake.
I'm taking you out of the game for now. No jobs will be offered and you won't be able to fence your goods.
Speak to Vex to make the proper reparations if you want back in. Now get out of my sight.
Until you're done with Vex, we don't have anything to discuss.
You've done it now, whelp. You broke the rules and now you're knee deep in it.
That means your out. No jobs, no payouts... no nothing.
You want to get back into our graces, you need to talk to Vex. She'll set you straight.
Sorry. We got nothin' to talk about. Vex will straighten you out.
Are you crazy? What were you thinkin'? You can't just go around doin' things the way you please!
Now we have to kick you out until things cool down. Can't give you any jobs or payouts for goods.
Go talk to Vex. She'll tell you the why's and how's if you want to get back in.
Until you get back into the Guild's graces, we have nothing to speak about.
Straighten yourself out with the Guild and then maybe we can talk.
Don't want to know what you did and I don't care. Just keep away from me.
I may be new around here, but at least I know how to follow the rules.
Sorry, I'm not buying any goods until you straighten this out with Vex.
I'll serve you after you've paid Vex.
You better straighten things with the Guild or you won't be welcome here anymore.
Settle your accounts with Vex, and then we can talk.
Hmph. I don't talk with Guild traitors.
Pay your dues and we'll speak.
It's a shame you got booted from the Guild... things were going so well.
Come back when you're in the Guild's good graces.
You want my advice? Pay your debt to Vex quickly and she'll forget the whole thing.
You're in it deep... better start shoveling your way out.
I'm surprised you're even showing your face around here after what you did.
Well, well. If it isn't Brynjolf's little protege.
I'm going to make this short and sweet, because frankly I don't think you deserve another shot.
You've broken the rules and now you need to pay... and it's going to cost you quite a bit.
This is the Thieves Guild, genius. How do you think? With gold. A lot of gold.
Did you think we'd accept a heartfelt apology and let bygones be bygones?
I'd say it's time you put your nose to the grindstone and figure it out for yourself. You claim to be a thief... act like one.
Pick pockets, knock over houses... heck, I don't care if you have to bust into a palace. You do what you have to do to come up with the coin.
You'd better. Because until you do, you don't get a single coin from us... and you won't be able to use our fences.
Anything you steal, you bring it straight to me.
Now get out of here and don't come back until your pockets are full.
Again? Didn't we teach you enough of a lesson the first time?
I suppose it's tough for an old dog to learn new tricks.
Anyway, you know the drill. You want to buy back in, and it'll cost you.
And here I expected you to hop the next caravan to Morrowind. What have you got for me?
I hope you brought a little something for me.
First, let's count the coin, then we can get back to business.
It's all here. Well, congratulations. You're one of us again.
Next time you decide to pull a stunt like that again, just remember how much it hurt to give this away.
I hope you come up with that gold soon.
You have the gold yet or what?
I believe you owe the Guild something.
Got any ale or mead?
First war, and now dragons. Everywhere they go, the Nords bring nothing but ruin.
Ain't nothing for it. They're still in charge.
I wonder if we should finally leave Markarth. These dragon attacks, I think Skyrim is cursed.
What kind of talk is this? The man I married would never speak of leaving his home.
I just don't know if I can keep you safe.
emphasis on [QUOTE]we[QUOTE] - WE will keep each other safe
More settlements have sent riders to say dragons are being spotted throughout Skyrim.
The Forsworn ambush our roads and dragons cloud the skies. Is there any good news?
Umm.... No, my Jarl. I'm afraid there isn't.
I want soldiers sent to deal with these dragons. Every able-bodied man and woman who can carry a bow.
We can't do that. Every soldier we send to hunt dragons is one more man that can't defend the Reach.
Killing dragons isn't defending the Reach?
Our men know how to kill Forsworn and Legionnaires, not dragons.
Surprised to see you working. Mulush almost broke your arm yesterday.
Does it look like I can afford losing a day's wage? That damn Orc isn't getting the best of me.
Oh, no.
Dagur's been talking at you, hasn't he? Gotten you roped into his little plan to fix Ranmir's life?
I'll tell you what I told him -- stay out of it. It's none of your business. Those aren't folks you want to get tangled up with.
No there isn't. And I suggest you leave it at that. I don't want to see anyone get hurt over this.
You'll wind up getting yourself killed. Dagur shouldn't have said a word about it.
I love the man, bless his heart, but he doesn't know the whole story.
Enough to know that it's not worth it.
Ranmir's a good boy, and he doesn't deserve what fate pushed his way, but there's only so far I'll go to risk my neck.
One night Ranmir was in here like always, drinking himself to death.
When I told him there was no more Honningbrew, that he'd drank it all, he got angry.
He ranted at me, how I didn't know what he's been through, how Isabelle broke his heart when she ran off with some thief named Vex...
He said he'd even gone to Riften to try and find the bastard. I think maybe he was hoping they'd just kill him, and that'd be the end of it.
Dagur never heard any of this, and I chose to keep it to myself. I'm only telling you so you don't get into trouble.
Riften and thieves means trouble. Just leave it alone.
That remains to be seen. By rights, she has a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.
That's the real question, isn't it? No one can deny Elisif has a legitimate claim to become High Queen of Skyrim...
Well... By rights, she had a legitimate claim as High Queen of Skyrim.
But now Skyrim is at Ulfric's mercy.
The moot will meet and choose Ulfric as High King. With his troops in most of the cities, they have little choice.
You'll pay those rumors no heed if you wish to retain your welcome in this city.
She may be young, but Elisif is the Jarl by right. And here in Skyrim, if nothing else, we respect the traditions of our father's fathers.
You'd do well to remember that.
Because killing her would yield no political advantage.
By leaving Elisif alive, Ulfric completes the separation of the Empire and Skyrim.
With Ulfric's troops here, Elisif will be forced to support his bid for High King. He secures the position and appears above reproach.
What's more, Ulfric's refusal to execute his slain enemy's wife will be portrayed as the ultimate act of compassion. Hmph. It's genius, really.
Oh, most certainly. At least, when Elisif herself asks.
If you're inquiring whether we have concerns about her age and inexperience, well, let me put it this way...
The Thanes have every confidence in General Tullius's leadership.
I don't suppose it matters much anymore.
As long as Ulfric wishes Elisif to remain Jarl, remain Jarl she will. And the Thanes will continue to follow her orders.
As long as those orders came from Ulfric.
Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg.
Pained, grief-stricken
Because that's what traitorous cowards do when they desire power.
And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare.
When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be.
Hmmm... A question I am all to familiar with. One my very Thanes ask often.
They worry that Tullius is so focused on the war, that he risks forgetting what's best for our people.
The real irony is that, while General Tullius is certainly no Nord, the people of Skyrim would be lost without him.

Welcome to the College of Winterhold. I am Faralda, one of the senior Wizards here.
Now, I must advise you that if your only purpose in being here is to complain, you would be far better off speaking with the Jarl of Winterhold.
If, however, you seek something more, I will be happy to assist you.
Is there some way I can assist you?
apologetic
Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand.
This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge.
It is no great secret that we have been unjustly blamed for a great many things over the years.
slightly sarcastic, condescending
Thus we must take certain precautions in order to secure our safety.
I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College.
joking, but in a [QUOTE]haha but I really mean it, don't mess with me[QUOTE] sense
The more important question is: why are you here?
Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?
It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what you can offer the College.
Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic.
A small test, if you will.
If you can pass the test, then yes.
I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you.
Do you?
It is true there are some here who have spent years studying the accumulated knowledge of the scrolls.
But what you seek does not come easily, and can destroy those without a strong will.
Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it.
Shhhhhh...
That's definitely going in my part of the Edda.
Sorry, I need to pay attention so I can remember this.
A man opens a gate and they cut his head off? Doesn't seem right to me.
I guess it's all over. I expected... I don't know what I expected.
Roggvir always talked about his honor. Seems to me honorable men don't get executed.
They should have drawn it out some more. He deserved a slower death.
Excuse me, I'm trying to watch a traitor to the Empire lose his head.
Roggvir... Why did it have to be like this?
That's my brother up there.
I still can't believe he knew what he was doing when he opened that gate...
Can we talk later?
Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them.
Best to keep clear.
Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.
There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so.
Nobody we know, by the smell.
Some can't separate the animal from themselves. Go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone.
We should keep moving.
Nothing we can do for these ones now.
Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.
No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.
We're getting close now. Be careful. Their leader is a tricky one.
They call him [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
They call her [QUOTE]the Skinner.[QUOTE]
I don't think I need to tell you why.
I stand where I have always stood. Here in Morthal.
Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves. I fear dark days approach and all of Skyrim's strength will be needed.
That's what many here wanted. A quiet life in a quiet place, without the noise or the trouble of a city.
Now some worry this wizard, Falion, will foul it all up.
The people still doubt me, don't they.
No, not at all. It's just...
It does not surprise me. They do not share in what I see, and I cannot explain it to them.
Just guide them well, and all will work out.
I have never doubted that, husband.
Have you made a decision about Falion?
What decision is there to be made? I allowed him to live here. I stand by that.
Yes, but there are concerns. Rumors that he's up to something.
We are all up to something, my dear. All is as it should be.
What troubles you, husband?
unconvincing
Joric will be what Joric will be. Give it time.
Still, I fear there is some connection.
How's business?
Very funny.
slightly embarrassed
It's as bad as ever.
When are you gonna do somethin' to help Falion? Stop people sayin' things about him?
You have to understand, his presence here has caused... Well, it's difficult for the people to get used to.
Yes, well. Perhaps you're right.
intimidating
The mine will be the talk of Skyrim soon, you'll see. It'll be the stuff of legends.
It's a matter of time before the Jarl is coming to me asking for money. This mine is going to make me... I  mean us, rich.
I know they laughed when I said I wanted to keep the mine open. I'll show them. I'll show them all.
You're welcome to look around, of course, but understand that this place belongs to me.
Thorgar says we'll find rocks soon, the kind worth gold.
I'm the best at breaking up rocks. Thorgar says so.
It's cold in the mine, but Thorgar really needs me, so I stay.
Be careful where you step in the mine. Don't want to cover up some valuable ore, or gems, or... Or something...
Any time I get tired of working, I just think that maybe that next swing will make me rich. It keeps me going.
It's going to happen soon, I just know it. We'll strike something better than iron. Silver, or maybe even gold. You'll see.
We were supposed to be rich by now, you know. Thorgar insisted we'd be swimming in gold.
I'm starting to think we might not even find iron in here. We've been at it for so long.
Is it still worth it? When do you decide enough is enough, and just walk away?

I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works.
The door is hidden, but I will show you the way.
Aela will be joining us shortly. Once she's inside, we can follow.
Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was.
And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves.
We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now let's move.
This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside.
I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form.
She's agreed to be your forebear.
Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?
Are you awake?
I was starting to think you might never come back.
You were born into the pack, brother.
You were born into the pack, sister.
I almost envy you. That first time is always the most... intense.
You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did at his first turning.
You have the blood of the wolf in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you can call on it again, though.
Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.
Nothing, until you choose to use it.
Then, well... you got a taste. Stronger, faster.
It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed.
Cure? Hah. You're sounding like the old man.
I... shouldn't say that.
I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land.
If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here.
(playful) got caught in a game of tag
you are a bandit that the player just agree to pay off to pass through the road
you are a bandit that the player just told they could not pay off
you are a bandit that has been paid off by the player to pass the road and are telling the player to move along
you are a bandit who the player has paid to pass through the road telling them to be on their way
you are a bandit that told the player to get lost, and because they didn't now you are going to attack
You know, now that I think of it, that sounds fair. Just shove off before the others notice.
Ha! Tough talk for someone who's about to have their guts spilled.
Eh, fine. I can tell you aren't worth the trouble. Just get out of here before I change my mind.
How does a knife in the gut sound? It's 200 gold or your life.
You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?
Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself.
So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?
Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course.
your way of saying [QUOTE]glad to be working with you again, Esbern[QUOTE]
Always. Let's go see if we can find this Sky Haven Temple.
We'll meet you there. Be careful. That part of the Reach is rough country these days.
Yes, exactly. Well, I think so. It's certainly our best hope. The ancient Blades remembered much Akaviri dragonlore that has now been forgotten.
This is what I've been trying to explain. It's in Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach.
That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.
Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here.
you are speechless
you're going to actually miss the old lug
as wistful as you get - you're actually going to miss that tough old bird
Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.
Thank you. Please, do not open it. It is... private.
I understand.
The Divines reveal things to me at times, yes. I do not hide this.
It is a gift. Anyone who believes otherwise does not and cannot understand it.
If you stand before me to accuse me of sacrificing children, or eating the hearts of the dead, you may save your breath.
I have done no such thing, nor do I intend to. I simply wish to live my life in peace.
The people of Morthal would much rather weave their own horrid tales about my life than simply ask me for the truth.
If they choose to fear me in their ignorance, that is their choice. But it will not change what is true.
I keep to myself. I offer spells and scrolls to those who need them, and wisdom in Conjuration magic for those who wish to learn.
Beyond that I seek only to be left alone to pursue my research.
You will not disrespect Jarl Idgrod while in this Hall. Do we have an understanding?
Then by all means, go about your business.
It's no secret that Jarl Idgrod is... different. It's also no secret that there are rumors about her and her visions.
I won't repeat them, and I won't allow them to be spread under this roof.
Now, you go about your business.
No? Then how do you like the idea of having your legs broken?
Mind your manners in this hall, friend.
Why, good evening Jonna!
Is it true that you kill deer and eat their hearts?
I don't know. Someone in town said it.
It's not true, I assure you.
Don't believe everything you hear, child.
You are looking after your brother, yes?
Yes, mother.
Good. He must be kept safe from harm.
What sort of harm? Have you had a vision?
No, no. Just watch over him.
I will be Jarl someday, mother?
That is what the Divines have planned for you, yes.
Have you... Do you see that future? Will I be a good leader?
All things are possible, my child. But I believe it is within you to succeed.

The visions continue to hold me in balance, Gorm.
Do not worry, my friend. All is well.
All right, you want to go?
Watch it, there, brother.
Watch it, there, sister.
Look at that.
That someone would attack Jorrvaskr... it's unthinkable.

Don't let Viola catch you in her house.
Sneak that ring back to Viola before we both get caught.
Have you taken care of that... little problem?
Remember. I need that bandit dead. Not alive.
Bandits are cowards. Don't strain yourself chasing them all down.
Show those marauders what Windhelm justice tastes like.
Vampires are clever hunters. More clever than you, definitely.
I want no mercy for those Forsworn. Understand?
Good luck with the giant. Don't get stepped on.
Execute every last bandit. Spare no one.
Retrieve that shield at all costs.
Come back as soon as you have the helm.
If you find that sword, please bring it to me.
If you find that ring, bring it here.
That journal means a lot to me, if you find it.
I do miss that helmet....
Hopefully, that story about Lenne's Shield is true.
Don't forget. You find Queen Freydis's Sword, I'll reward you.
This looks promising.
Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.
We've got to get this bridge down.
These pillars must have something to do with it.
Yes. These are Akaviri symbols.
Let's see... you have the symbol for [QUOTE]King[QUOTE]... and [QUOTE]Warrior[QUOTE]...
And of course the symbol for [QUOTE]Dragonborn.[QUOTE] That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the left.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the middle pillar.
Yes, that's it. The symbol on the pillar on the right.
Given that Sky Haven Temple was sealed against the return of the Dragonborn, I would try turning all the pillars to that symbol.
Whatever you did, it worked. Let's see what else those old Blades left in our way.
Why are you stopping?
We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?
Hmm, Esbern's right. Look like pressure plates.
I would suggest staying on the plates with the Dragonborn symbol.
Be careful.
There should be a way to turn this off.
We'll cross once it's safe.
Looks safe now. Let's move.
Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance.
Esbern, look out!

We are on the hunt.
Meat from fresh kills.
What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?
You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire.
Well. I'll let it slide this time. But you'd be smart to take that off. Someone might get the wrong idea.
Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time.
You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!
Is that right? Here's how the Legion deals with rebel scum like you.
I'm glad you decided to come with me. We're almost to Riverwood.
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my sister will be glad to help you out.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. I never understood how my sister could stand living in the shadow of that place.
Remember, this isn't Stormcloak territory. If we're ahead of the news from Helgen we should be fine as long as we don't do anything stupid.
If we run into any Imperials, just let me do the talking, all right?
You sure you won't change your mind? Riverwood isn't far. I'm sure my uncle will be glad to help you out.
See that ruin up there? Bleak Falls Barrow. When I was a boy, that place always used to give me nightmares.
Listen, as far as I'm concerned you've already earned your pardon.
But until we get that confirmed by General Tullius, just stay clear of other Imperial soldiers and avoid any complications, all right?
I hear you've been busy of late.
Oh? Well, I won't turn down your money.
By helping me, you're helping the good folk of Whiterun. How could I say no to that?
I'll take your money, but I make no promises of a large return on your investment. These are troubled times, after all.
Splendid! With the extra coin, I'll be able to purchase twice the volume in supplies that I normally do.
I've been looking to expand the business, and your investment will certainly help with that. I accept!
Such an investment will mean that I can take better care of my family, as well as my customers.
An investment, is it? Alright, I'm sure I can put the extra money to good use.
Splendid! I've been looking for a new investor. Now it seems my search is over.
Come to see the hag with an offering of coin, then? So be it. I accept your investment.
Of course you want to invest in my business. I'm the finest blacksmith in all Skyrim.
How kind. At my age, I've certainly learned how to spend wisely.
You want to give me money? Just like that? Fine, but I intend to earn that investment. I don't need handouts.
Ah yes, good idea. Best to let a professional businessman handle that money for you.
You make an interesting offer. Very well, I'm sure that I can put the extra coin to good use.
An investment? Very well, I don't see why not.
You have my thanks, friend.
Ah, the sound of clinking coins. Even better, the sound of clinking coins in my hand!
I'll call upon my suppliers this very evening and arrange to double my orders.
I'll start planning how best to spend this. You have my thanks!
You'll look back on this as one of your best decisions, I swear it.
If you want to make the most of your investment, you'll come here to sell your goods.
Thank you so much! With this coin, I'll be able to double my stock.
Ah, look at the pretty, shiny coins. Now, how best to spend them?
If you have spare weapons and armor to sell, bring them here.
More coin means more supplies, and that means more useful balms, potions and remedies for everyone.
I'll work hard to justify your faith in me.
A wise choice, my friend. After all, what would a common adventurer know about the complexities of finance?
Wise is the one who spends a few coins now to make a fortune later.
Thank you. When I have the time, I'll try to think of how best to use this.
May prosperity bless us both!
Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.
No! You'll never take me alive!
Take the money, just let us go...
Shut up or they'll kill us, you idiot! Once they're gone I'll pick the lock...

My old bones don't hurt so much now.
Healing magic? An Orc lets her wounds heal naturally...
Huh? What...oh! That felt nice.
What...hey! That felt good.
No need to do that now.
Suddenly I feel much better.
You heal away my scars and there's gonna be a problem...
That put a spring in my step.

Save it for the battlefield.
I wasn't hurt, but that did make me feel better.

I've heard Jaree-Ra is hanging around the Wells District, looking for new blood to hire.
Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together!
Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there.

After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor.
Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here.
Yes, and I'm more than happy to give it to you.
I mean look at this place. I've never seen so much wealth down here. You've made us all rich.
Here you go... should fit you like a glove... boss.
I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.
Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back.
One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse.
They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin.
I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.

Thank you for your time.

Not right now.

I've been waiting for Roggvir's execution. Talk to me later.
Go away.
They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.
Of course! You don't remember getting here.
Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.
You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.
You're all heart, Vivienne.
No! Aunt Agna! Talos, why didn't I go in with her?
He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there!
Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...
This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...
You found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.
We're not killing them, they were already dead. We're helping them back to Sovngarde.
Vals Veran will die for what he's done.
That dark elf is about to be a dead elf.
The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around!
Sovngarde is a myth, you s'wit! And now you can join your ancestors in service to me!
I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!
I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat.
Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.
You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?
Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started.
Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do.
I'll start round one. Down the hatch!
Your turn!
One down, my friend. One down.
Sorry to hear that.
And another one for me.
And how about you?
So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest.
Awww, well, maybe next time.
Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.
You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there.
Hey, you don't look so good...

What do you say, Irileth? You're being awfully quiet.
Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?
Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.
But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.
Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them.
If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?
Go ahead... try to Shout.
Have you tried to Shout?
They say the Dragonborn can Shout without any training. Like Talos himself...
I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this.
General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.
Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.
We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur.
I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the Red Wave.
Highly annoyed, almost angry but not quite.
A bit barbed and icy. There is a cold anger behind this remark. Emphasis on [QUOTE]and MY profits[QUOTE]
There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must.
Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here.
You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks.
Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously.
If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all.
We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this.
And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards.
Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day.
Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more.
It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling.
We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.
Is it that time again already?
Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements.
Sarcasm.
Hold your tongue, Wizard, or you're likely to lose it.
Sarcastic but also menacing
Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children.
Steward Falk, I have a task for you.
I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally.
A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare.
General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.
General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?
My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort.
There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war.
Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with with the general in person.
I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.
Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time.
Cheerful, enthusiastic
Hesitation, doubt. This speaker is reacting to an idea he's just heard which he thinks is terrible, but he is trying to be polite about it.
After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks.
I must protest, my Jarl.
A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.
Resigned
Amused, a bit jovial
Yes, my Jarl.
We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl.
If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city.
Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing.
It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly.
Skeptical, doubtful
I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense.
Stern, authoritative
Men who, I might add, we're precious short on.
I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication.
However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end.
No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart.
In any case he won't be turnin' me into no Imperial soldier. I know my place, and it's at your side.
It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir.
Old Nord sacrifice place. Be careful around here. Let's look for a way to open the bars.
Ah, the ceremonial juncture. The old Nords used to do sacrifices here. Look around for a way to open those bars.
The only thing I heard is a rumor that a boy named Aventus Aretino, in Windhelm, has been attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood.
He used to live here in Riften at the Orphanage on the other side of town but I think he ran away. Can't say I blame him.
They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.
I already told you. They call me Dirge, 'cause I'm the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground.
Oh yeah? I think so too. You're pretty smart.
Hey, here. Have one on the house.
Good. Now shut up and get out of my face.
No, no. Sorry if I sounded so mean there. My brother always said I have a big mouth.
Here, have one on me.
Yeah, my problem is I'm too tired to punch your face in.
Already did.
Maul? Yeah. That jerk works for Maven Black-Briar now. Left me down here watching this garbage heap.
I guess he's better at all that talking stuff anyway. I'd just mess everything up.
The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn.
We should be careful. There's no telling what traps and wards the ancient Blades may have set.
The entrance must be past the Forsworn camp. Look for a canyon or cave entrance into the Karthspire.
Ah, yes. The entrance seems to be near what's now known as the Karthspire. We'll have to see what we find when we arrive.
Very good. I'll trust you to get there in one piece. Don't be long.
Your call. Might be safer to travel separately - attract less attention that way.
Don't worry, I'll get Esbern there in one piece. We'll wait for you near Karthspire. Good luck.
Well...that's disappointing. This one didn't survive the fall either.
No matter. Another one will be along any time now.
I'm sorry! This isn't what I want!
I don't want to do this!
I don't have any choice! I'm sorry!
Is someone there? Stay back! I don't want to attack you.
Stay away!
Stay back or I'll be forced to attack you!

Vals Veran. My family has never really seen eye to eye with him and he has finally gone off the deep end.
He's gone in to defile our family tomb by using our ancestors for his filthy dark elf necromancy.
No offense, I mean I'm sure you aren't into any of that kind of stuff.
My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I'm afraid to go in by myself.
My aunt went in after him, but she hasn't come out yet and I don't think I can take him by myself.
Fine, but I've locked the door so don't think you're getting in there without me.

You're in the wrong place to be asking those kind of questions, pal.
No. Not yet.
You'd better clear out before someone gets hurt.
Your lack of cooperation has been noted. We'll be back if we require further information. You won't get a second chance.

We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.
Mining is hard work, but we pay a fair price for any ore you dig up.
Are you looking to work? The mines are nearby. You bring me ore, I'll give you coin.
I'll buy everything you've dug up.

I was actually just about to head on inside. Be good to have someone watch my back.

Oh my, yes. I absolutely love weddings. I haven't found my special someone yet, but there's still hope. Vittoria is, well, getting up in years...
Am I! Free food and wine, and nobody trying to throw me in the dungeon. I wish they did weddings here every day.
Not really. It's just a bunch of elders standing around, looking important. I wish something exciting would happen.
Oh. Why... why certainly. I keep telling myself I'm not losing a son, I'm gaining an Imperial. Daughter. An Imperial daughter...
No, I'm not having a good time. My boy just married a gods-forsaken Imperial. Skyrim is full of eager Nord women, and he beds down with the enemy.
The best. Vittoria's a good woman. Any man should be so lucky. I know my father's not happy about me marrying an Imperial, but that's his problem.
I most certainly am not. I've just lost my daughter to a Nord beast, and my nephew Titus is too busy playing Emperor to even show up.
I am, thank you. I do so enjoy singing at weddings. It's just one of the many duties we at the Bards College are called upon to perform.
So far. I just hope things remain calm. Wine gets drunk, tempers flare. This may be a joyous celebration, but it's shadowed by a lot of animosity.
Oh, yes. Presiding over the union of two lovers is one of my greatest responsibilities. It helps that Asgeir and Vittoria truly care for each other.
She's dead! On my watch! This won't stand!
I'm just here to provide protection for his eminence's cousin. Please, enjoy yourself.
Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.
Just how long did you expect me to keep those people distracted? I had to let the whole plan fall through.
Well, at least you didn't do anything stupid. Next time, when you're given a job, don't wander off or take your sweet time.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing around here has been going well lately.

[QUOTE]it figures[QUOTE] attitude
congratulatory
It's good we hold the Reach. Were the rebels to gain control, the silver mines would give them coin to hire more thugs and expand their violence.
pleased, but pointed. Reminding the person you are talking to that it is their fault you were even in this position
We need to stem the flow of silver to the rebellion. Until we retake the Reach, the Stormcloaks will plunder it's mines to fund further violence.
Hjaalmarch is an important buffer zone between the rebel forces and the capital. Ulfric will try to break through at some point.
I'm losing my patience with this damn war. We must take Hjaalmarch back! The Stormcloaks will be beating upon the doors of the capital soon.
Ulfric will want to take Whiterun from us. But we will hold fast. We can't give the rebellion free reign through the center of Skyrim.
I can't believe we lost Whiterun. The rebels have a great advantage in controlling the center now. We must take it back!
By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.
I fear losing Falkreath may give too much advantage to Ulfric. The rebels now control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. I want it back.
Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh?
Controlling the Pale gives Ulfric a port town and takes the pressure off of Windhelm. But it's only a matter of time before it's back in our hands.
Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until I'm ready to march on Windhelm.
There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home.
I almost can't believe it's over. The rebellion is squashed, Windhelm is free. I must admit, Ulfric put up a stronger fight than I was expecting.
We will oust Ulfric from Windhelm soon enough. And when we do, I'll have his head on a plate.
Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.
We need the Rift. We need to regain control of it before we can march on Windhelm without worry about our rear guard.
I almost can't believe it. The Empire has been defeated. The world bears witness to the power and righteousness of the sons and daughters of Skyrim.
Soon enough we will march on Solitude. And on that day the heroes of Sovngarde will march with us, and the Empire will fall to its knees in fear.
Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim.
The Empire's ravenous hunger for Skyrim's silver makes them fierce. But rest assured, we'll win the Reach and wrest it from their greedy paws.
Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.
We should take Hjaalmarch. It'll be an important pressure point on the Imperials. We'd be within spitting distance of the capital.
We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
The Imperials have really dug into Whiterun. We'll wrest it from them soon enough. We must. Its central position is key.
I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
The Empire thinks it holds Falkreath from us. But the souls of Skyrim's bravest are buried there and will fill our hearts and strengthen our blades.
Tullius has camps in the Pale, entertaining thoughts of battle. The Empire still underestimates the force of our cause. It will be their undoing.
I can't believe we let them take the Pale. Losing the port of Dawnstar is lessened only by the threat of Imperial forces being so close to Windhelm.
I'm not sure why Tullius is wasting his time trying to take Winterhold from us. But if he wants to throw his men away, I'll gladly accept that gift.
I don't like Imperial troops holed up in Winterhold... such a close march to Windhelm. So I'm sending a campaign up there to take it back.
Damn Tullius. He's pocketed men in the Rift. It's dangerous having Imperials skulking about on the southern border of Eastmarch.
Losing the Rift gives Tullius easy access to the south of Eastmarch. Talos preserve us. We must take it back!

Something to report?
The General and I have our disagreements, but he's the best hope for both the Empire and Skyrim.
Many of my countrymen joined the rebels. They can't see the big picture. Skyrim needs the Empire as much as it needs us.
Make it quick. I get enough delays from politicians.
The boss is going to cut those creepy cave people to pieces!
Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.
I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.
I would be fine if they didn't.  Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.

No! Noooooooo!
I daresay you've learned all I can teach you.
But... That doesn't mean there isn't more out there.
Over the years I've heard things. Powerful magics lost to the ages, incredible spells that only the most skilled mages can master.
This is the only thing I've ever found. I think it's better off in your hands.

Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...
Hurry up with it, we've got a merchant in the pit to take care of after we carve this thing up.
If there's nothing else, I really must ask you to leave.
I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.
Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.
Keep your eyes to the road.
Thanks again for the ice wraith teeth.
Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.
Keep your belly full and your shoulders strong.
Come back when you're ready to spend more gold... goodness knows I could use it.
Safe travels, landstrider.
Good journey, marsh-friend.
Return anytime. You're quite welcome here.
Remember, nothing but genuine fire salts will do... the forge knows the difference.
If you need any more smithing work, come see me again.
Thanks for your business.
It was nice to meet you.
Be careful out there... Riften can be dangerous.
Door's over there. Why don't you use it?
Come back and see us again.
Just get out of here.
If you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to.
Imperial bastard.
Farewell, kinsman.
Support Ulfric or die trying. There's nothing in between.
Talos preserve you.
Talos guide you.
It's been good talking to you.
Good, now maybe I can get back to work.
Come back and see us again!
Travel safe.
Remember to give at the temple.
Rude, as if saying to someone in your way
When I find that bitch, I'm going to wring her little neck.
Visit me anytime. I'm not going anywhere soon.
I believe we're done.
Out of my way.
Don't forget to check your supply chest from time to time.
My experiments can't be completed until you've brought me those ingredients. Do hurry.
As if lost in thought
You'd do well to remember who's really in charge around here.

You represent Mara now. Set an example for all.
Good journey, my child!
I don't know why I bother.
Try and get those marks without violence please. I don't want to be responsible for their deaths... or yours.
Sure, leave. Not like you care anyway.
Remain vigilant and don't trust anyone.
You've been kind, I thank you.
Any healing potion will do. Please hurry.
What am I going to do?
A Dreth never forgets a friend.
Remember, keep this to yourself.
Please, come back and speak to me anytime.
Be cautious, the pilgrimage to the Shrine is not an easy one.
I'd ask you maintain civility while you're here.
Good journey to you.
You're welcome in Riften as long as you continue to obey our laws.
I'm keeping my eye on you.
I have to remember... ward first, then summon.
Okay, now where did I put those spiders?
I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.
Please be careful, I don't wish to be the reason for your death.
Just stay away from me and I'll forget we had this discussion.
Safe travels.
Watch yourself around here, it isn't safe.
Yes, yes... goodbye.
You didn't need to leave so soon.
chuckle at end (obnoxious)
Be careful, the road to Shor's Stone could be dangerous.
Don't forget us if you need supplies for your journey.
Honored guests.
Good people of Solitude.
Good friends and neighbors.
I just wanted to take this time to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband.
Are you all enjoying yourselves? Please, eat, drink, and make merry on this most happy of days.
My husband Aesgir and I thank you for coming to our reception. We thank you for sharing the love we have for each other.
Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves.
These days, it seems there is dread everywhere, whether it be war or dragon. But I beg you - here, today, put such fears aside. Enjoy yourselves!
In this courtyard, there are no Stormcloaks. There are no Imperials. There are only people, come to celebrate a union of two souls. So make merry!
I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.
You have all helped make this a truly extraordinary wedding. All of my dreams have come true. So thank you. Thank you all.
May you all be as happy in your lives as I know I will be in mine. Thank you again for everything.
I guess we should have expected this response, hmm?
Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted.
I'll try and hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary!
We'll meet back up at the Sanctuary! I'll be fine. Go!
Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.
Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice.
Strike us with the power of your Voice.
Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead.
Damned good shooting, boys!
Is it really dead?
We killed it! I can't believe it!
I thought we were all dead for sure!
Look at that!
Everybody get back!
What's happening?!
That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn.
There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever.
awed and excited
Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.
But I still hear the call of the blood.
We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.
You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily.
Leave that to me.
Would you now? Here, let me have a look at you.
Hm. Yes, perhaps. A certain strength of spirit.
Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?
Master, you're not truly considering accepting her?
I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts.
Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.
Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference.
tired of having to explain this again
And their arm.
Oh you're back. Do you still think you could stand as a Companion?
Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?
Of course. How are you in a battle, girl?
That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.
Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake.
Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle.
That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that.
Not here. Out in the yard. Come on.
The old man said to have a look at you, so let's do this.
Just have a few swings at me so I can see your form. Don't worry, I can take it.
Not bad. Next time won't be so easy.
Now that's impressive. You're mightier than you look.
What do you think this is? We don't do battle with magic around here, new blood. Now come at me.
Come on now, fight your own battles.
I have a favor to ask.
This isn't a command. Just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.
That's a good man.
Well done.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Good to see you made it up here.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Wait... I remember you. So the old man thinks you've got some heart, I guess.
Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new here?
You know this one? I saw him training in the yard with Vilkas.
You know this one? I saw her training in the yard with Vilkas.
I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.
Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.
Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.
There you are. I had wondered where you got to.
Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?
Ah, a man of action.
Ah, a woman who lets her actions speak for her. I knew there was something I liked about you.
Woah, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute.
I like your fire, though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime.
Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head.
shouting at someone to summon them
Did you call me?
This is meant affectionately
Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.
New blood? Oh, I remember you. Come on, follow me.
New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.
Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they are good people.
They challenge us to be our best.
Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes.
I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life.
The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired.
Tilma will keep the place clean. She always has.
All right, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you.
Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work.
Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do.
Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.
You've already turned down a job that I had for you.
Work needs doing, and if you're not up to it, maybe you're not cut out to be a Companion.
Be cautious. Beasts are not nearly as predictable as men. Give the thing a quick death.
Good. I knew that we could count on you. It's simply a beast, but be cautious. The beasts of Skyrim are made of sterner stuff than most.
I knew we could count on you. Get it taken care of right away. Nobody wants an animal left roaming around in their place.
You're not afraid, are you? Of animals? Come back when you find your spine.
Unfortunate, but someone else will take care of it.
I see. Well, should you change your mind, the contract will be available for a while.
Looks like someone's been digging here. And recently.
Tread lightly.
Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.
Shor's bones... how did they find this place?
I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true.
Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast.
Some take to it more than others.
Of course you will.
Fine, I'll get someone else to take care of it.
This work isn't for everyone. Maybe you're more cut out for those snowberries up in Winterhold.
This isn't an order of cowards. I'll find someone more agreeable, I'm sure.
Let's get this over with.
Come on. What are you waiting for?
Now it's your turn, Thalmor bitch.
The Blades will never be defeated, Thalmor dog.
I could use a hand here.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't looking for trouble.
I gave up this kind of thing a long time ago.
You can still run. It's not too late.
You've brought this on yourself.
Thalmor dog! Death is too good for you.
You'll die knowing it was the Blades that sent you to Oblivion.
You're starting to make me angry.
I'm in a bit of trouble here.
I need some help with this one!
You should not have meddled in the Thalmor's affairs.
The Thalmor's memory is long.
Esbern cannot elude us, fool.
I shall sing of thee in Sovngarde!
Feel the bite of my axe!
It is glorious to battle once again in Tamriel!
Ah... the power of the dragon is yours! There can be no doubt that you are the Dragonborn of prophecy.
Alduin cannot ignore this for long.
Ah! I've heard of this Shouting, but never seen it. Fascinating...
I've read the dragon language, but to hear it spoken is most interesting.
This skill should prove very useful, Dragonborn. Fighting fire with fire, as the saying goes.
The dragons will surely fear your Voice.

Please. Not now. You'll know when I'm ready to discuss the issue.
Well now... would you look at that.
I never imagined we'd find something like this.
Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Hjaalmarch. Congratulations.
I grant you this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now.

I do. A personal matter. My father died trying to negotiate with the Forsworn, back when that was possible.
They took his shield to those Hagraven beasts they consort with. I need you to bring it home where it belongs.
I warn you, it's dangerous work. No man of mine has ever faced a Hagraven and lived. I'll understand if you decline.
You've honored my father's memory in more ways than I have words to say.
Divines watch over you.
I hereby grant you permission to purchase property in my city. Talk to my steward if you're interested.
And take this. A gift from the Jarl's personal stores.
The last time I was in Whiterun, the tradesmen were talking about you. It seems your reputation as a businessman is growing.
Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.
I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested.
How thoughtful! I'll come take a look after supper.
Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?
Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword.
Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like.
We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it.
Cheerful
I'm trying something new, offering discounts for bulk purchases. So far, that seems to be working.
Are you making good progress with the planting?
So far, things are going well. Let's just hope the weather holds.
Ah, there's nothing like fresh air and honest labor to bolster the spirit.
True enough, but there's nothing wrong with a little adventure now and then. Not much excitement in working the soil every day.
Those little girls of yours are growing like weeds, Lemkil.
Now that you mention it, there is.
the odd taste mentioned is repulsive, even for you
I'm told they're the ravings of a madman... a wizard named Arondil and his peculiar cravings.
It's said to be spread across four volumes and very hard to come by. My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.
Then we have a deal.
In his later years, Andoril moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He prefered the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.
Yeah, but you're into gold. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm not going anywhere.
I can't believe it. You have them already?
Here, take this. This should cover your end of the work nicely.
It's a good start, but you need all four of the volumes or the set isn't complete.
Why don't you head back out to Yngvild and find the rest?
Only rumors. He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down.
The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform.
After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.
Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar.
The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.
Good. I was hoping you hadn't forgotten about it.
As promised, here's your payment for bringing them to me. Got it as part of a fair trade from my client.
Spare a coin for a fellow Nord who's down on his luck?
So you can spend it on drinks at the Bannered Mare? If it's food you need, ask for that instead.
Never you mind, then. I'll find a more charitable soul.
Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right, wrong.... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone, and you obeyed.
Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse.
Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of the Reach. Congratulations.
I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office.
There is room in my court for a new Thane. It's an honorary title, mainly, but there are a few perks someone like you could make use of.
However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold, and who owns at least one piece of property in my city.
You help my people and purchase a house from my steward, and I'll make you my Thane.
However, I could only grant the title to someone who is known throughout my Hold.

The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.
Long life to you, Thane.
I am your sword and your shield.
Honor to you, my Thane.
What do you need, my Thane?
Honored to see you again, my Thane.
Oh, forgive me, Thane. I didn't realize it was you.
We'll look the other way this time, but even the Jarl's influence has its limits. Be more careful.
Wait... I know you.
In the name of the Jarl, I'm ordering you to stand fast!
Since you put it that way, I think we can overlook your crime for now.
All right, all right. Just keep your voice down and don't let me catch you again.
Everything here appears to be in order. You can move along now.
I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Haafingar. Congratulations.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. Congratulations.
explaining customary requirements
If you do good works for the people and purchase a home from my steward, I'll name you my Thane.
Then by my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Eastmarch. Congratulations.
I'll also notify my guards of your new title.

That's right, mock the town beggar like everyone else. But I've got a right to browse, don't I? I ain't hurtin' anyone.

Those green apples you sold me the other day were delicious.
Aren't they? I always set some aside for myself when the traders bring them up from the south.
I'm sure you could charge double for those and still sell them all within a week.
You're right. I'll have to remember that the next time I get a shipment in.
Did you raise your prices, Carlotta?
I had to. The farmers are charging me double for the produce I sell.
Let me guess, they're saying it's because of this trouble with the Stormcloaks?
Exactly. Road patrols were cut in half because the Jarl needed soldiers. Now the bandits are bolder than ever.
They've been raiding the farms for food, and supplies are scarcer than ever. Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead.
This is a joke, so feel free to throw in a laugh at the end.
This is all just too much, too fast. Go get some work from Nazir. I need time to... to think...
I envy you the chance to see this dragon up close!
No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!
Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!
I don't know!

Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are.
Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it.
I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either.
General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence.
Their spies must've found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way.
I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you.

That crown must be here somewhere. Keep looking.
My pa always warned me not to mess with places like this.
Careful. No telling what will happen the next time you mess with that door.
Maybe that claw has a clue on it? You know, how to turn the rings so the door will open.
Keep a sharp eye out. There's no telling what we might run into in here.
shaking his head in disbelief
The Imperials will be sorry they got in our way.
So far, so good.
Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume.
That should do. Now - Inhale deeply.
Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them.
If anything actually happens, call a guard.
If the guards in the Gray Quarter weren't a bunch of n'wahs, I wouldn't be here talking to you.
My men have their orders. But it's a big city, and there's a war on. Plus these murders.
A few dark elves getting shoved around doesn't really amount to much.
Typical Nord. Beard for brains.
Watch that tongue, Rendar, or your whole lot could be down with the Argonians hauling ballast by tomorrow.
Well, nothing. At least not any more. Folk just call me that because of what I used to do.
I was a sailor for many a year. I made my coin as a trader and in time, I bought my own ship.
When I retired here in Windhelm, most folk already knew me as Captain Lonely-Gale, and the name just stuck.
Terrible shame, that. Seems we have a killer on the loose here in Windhelm.
He's claimed three victims that I know of, though maybe there's more that haven't been found yet.
All lovely young ladies, too. Let's hope the guards find that demon soon, and introduce him to the headsman's axe.
There's an author named Adonato staying at the inn. He's published a few works of historical fiction.
The clans Shatter-Shield and Cruel-Sea see most of the gold that passes through the city.
And obviously you have Ulfric, the Jarl and future High King.
Oh, and that busybody Viola Giordano. She's got her nose in everyone's business, which I guess is one way of being prominent.
If you're looking to pass the time, you can give Calixto a few septims and gawk at whater oddity he's come across lately.
If you're need of goods, there's a market. If it's a soft bed and a hot meal you're after, there's Candlehearth Hall.
Talos, who in life was known as Tiber Septim, united Tamriel and founded the Empire.
He was rewarded for his deeds by being joined with the Divines in eternal glory. The only mortal to do so.
We worship him that we might follow in his path. We can't literally join him in the heavens, but we may do our best to know them here on Nirn.
The Empire's elven puppetmasters never cared much for the idea of a human becoming a divine. So the worship of Talos is outlawed.
Skyrim doesn't take kindly to being told what to do. And to try and forget Talos, well... they may as well ordered us all to cut off our ears.
Like anyone, a crisis will push them towards devotion. I've been seeing a lot of the Shatter-Shields, since they lost their daughter.
Hillevi Cruel-Sea comes in a lot, but I haven't seen her husband here in years.
Ulfric prays for strength. I speak to Captain Lonely-Gale, but he doesn't spend much time here. Too busy.
Where else would we be?
When the Red Mountain burned, you could scarcely breathe in Morrowind. So we came west.
Windhelm is the first city on that road, and here we are.
If we had known the Nords would be so unwelcoming, we may have kept walking.
Well you see where we have to live. This forgotten alley. All the filth from the upper quarters flows downhill, like they say.
Good luck getting one of the guards to help with anything.
obviously the title is facetious
I've got what I came for, I better get back to Dragon Bridge.
Did you find anything at Wolfskull Cave?
None of that matters to me. Until someone takes a Dunmer, I let Windhelm deal with its own problems.

But there isn't any other way through.

You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.
There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!
Maybe you can find a way through somewhere above us.
You have your orders. Get moving.
No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush.
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.
Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead.
Don't give them a chance to warn the others!
Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could.
Now let's keep moving.
What in the nine holds is that?
Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?
Ah! The Hall of Stories... we must be getting close now.
One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?
Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got.
Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door.
See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.
Hmm... that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.
I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Looks like the door will open if we turn these rings the right way.
Is there anything on the claw that might show how to open this door?
Good job!
Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll find down here.
Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got.
Unblooded, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.
How's it going, Unblooded? You find anything yet?
Keep looking, Unblooded. There's got to be some way to get that thing open.
You see a lever anywhere?
That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more...
Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just the same.
Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down this way.
Oh... I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.
We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.
Yes, yes. We should proceed cautiously.

It's an honor, champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven.

No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.
Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though you start first.
Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need.
We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride.[QUOTE]
The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.
Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor.
It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion.
I'll begin searching up here.
So... I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink.
Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people.
I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works.
Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies.
The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend.
I call upon you, Lady Mara!
The Skull hungers. It yearns for memories and leaves nightmares in its wake.
Grant me the power to break through this barrier and to send the Skull to the depths of Oblivion!

It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit.
Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it.
You found... how in the world...
That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project...
In fact, who are you, anyway?
I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful.
You are, are you?
Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me?
I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you've saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now.
Come on, I'll explain on the way.
Ha! So you did.
I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me.
Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me.
I'll explain on the way.
No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back.
I was the one who thought of using this... this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure.
From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine.
This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow?
It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it.
Let's just hope they got it right this time.
I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer.
My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.

If Alduin himself could not stand against your Thu'um, I feel no shame in my own defeat.
You've returned. Good. What did you find at Wolfskull Cave?
I wish you well friend. Be careful.
Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
For the moment, the Wolf Queen has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old Catacombs.
A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the Catacombs themselves.
Good. Being at the summoning created a connection to Potema, you are the one to do this.
I can provide you with some help with her minions.
As to Potema herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the Catacombs and bring it back to be sanctified by Arkay.
Ah Potema. Former queen of Solitude and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history.
She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
Take this payment - the Jarl would thank you but she very much wants to keep Potema's return quiet.
Make no mistake we consider you a protector of Solitude.
Excellent! These things do have a way of working out when people take action. I'll sanctify the remains.
In case Falk doesn't make it clear - Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
I hope Falk made it clear that Solitude owes you a debt of gratitude.
Been a while since I've seen one of those. What you've got there is a Stone of Barenziah.
Not like that it isn't.
The stone was pried off of Barenziah's ceremonial crown by a thief in order to cover his tracks.
I think there were twenty-four in all. Most people keep them as a curiosity.
Some of the Guild members have tried to locate them over the years, but they haven't been successful... well, until now.
Look, I only buy things I can turn around quickly for a profit. And no one wants those stones unless they have the whole set.
Tell you what, if you find the rest of them, talk to me again. Otherwise, keep it and maybe it'll bring you luck.
Unbelievable! You must be the first person to set eyes on all twenty-four of them in... well, the last two eras.

If the stones were remounted on the crown, it would be of great benefit to the Thieves Guild.
I have it on good authority that the crown is within Tolvald's Cave; dropped by a Dunmer caravan leaving Morrowind long ago.
If you can bring it back, we could restore the paragon... and reap its benefits.
I knew you had it in you. After all, finding the Stones was no easy feat.
Well, I'm not one to welch on a deal, so here's your reward. I hope you put it to good use. I know I have.
I'll need to lock up the store. Thank you so much for agreeing to help us.
I should lock up the store now. Thank you again.

Olfrid sent ahead his compliments. Looks like his friend Arn is soon to be released thanks to his brand new identity.
More importanly, he's pledged the full support of the Battle-Born clan to the Thieves Guild.
Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons.
Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again.
Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned.
At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm.
Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with.
I wished you could have sent more of a message to those Summerset Shadows upstarts, but hopefully they'll stay out of our business.
I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back.
He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west.
The Guild's at full strength and we have you to thank for it. We've had our share of dark times, and now they seem like a distant memory.
very serious
When you walk through the Guild, don't be ashamed to hold your head high 'cause you're the best damn thief in the place.
Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit.
Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it.
We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon.
You're a natural. Never seen anythin' like it.
We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years.
I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the Flagon.
It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.
Well, I never thought I'd see the Guild this way ever again. The place is growin' into what it used to be when Gallus was runnin' the show.
Contacts are springin' up all over and I've got young footpads beatin' down the door to join up.
I got one last special request of you. Finish this one and all of Skyrim's ours for the takin'.
I don't know what your made of, but I've never seen anyone tackle this many jobs without endin' up dead or in jail.
We've got half of Skyrim back under our wing and the coin's startin' to flow.
Now, if you're ready, I got another special job for you.
I've got another special request and they specifically asked for you.
Your makin' a name for yourself, that's for sure. But more important, you're makin' a name for the Guild. Keep it up.
Well, it appears your actions are startin' to make waves out there. People are talkin' about the Guild again.
In fact, I just got a special job request in. I haven't gotten anythin' like it in years.
Got word from Torsten Cruel-Sea in Windhelm that a rival Guild is tryin' to get itself started.
Not only that but they're givin' us thieves a bad name by murderin' their marks.
Get over there and see what you can do.
We actually got a request from one of the most powerful families in Whiterun, the Battle-Born's.
Make your way up there and look for Olfrid. He says he's got a matter that requires a delicate touch, and I suggested you for the job.
a warning, but subtle
I want you to head out to Markarth and speak to Endon. He's a silversmith... has some kind of a shop there.
His father was a good friend of the Guild back in the day, and we could really use his family's influence back on our side.
I need you to make your way to Solitude and talk to Erikur. He's lookin' to run some kind of a shill job.
subtle warning, this is important
We will find her eventually.
She cannot hide from us forever.
If you locate her, find us in Rorikstead.
Quickly, come with me.
Find me the moment the Alik'r are taken care of.
And you're sure?
I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.
By Ysmir, this is just what we need. There'll be panic in the streets if this proves true.
Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about.
Listen you impudent cur. According to my scrying something happened at Wolfskull Cave that returned Potema to this world.
You weren't nearly as successful as you think, fool. According to my scrying the Wolf Queen has returned.
I'm Sybille Stentor, court mage of Solitude, and according to my scrying you've managed to unleash Potema herself!
What did you do in Wolfskull cave?!
I shall not be bound.
Something is wrong. There is an intruder.
You ants don't have the power to bind me!
Summoned with words. Bound by blood.
What! What are you doing?! You fools! You cannot bind me to your wills!
Yes! Yes! Return me to this realm!
As our voices summon you the blood of the innocent binds you Wolf Queen!
We summon Potema!
Long have you slept the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear us Wolf Queen! We Summon You!
Wolf Queen. Hear our call and awaken. We summon Potema!
Just remember I'm here if you rethink your decision.
Please get me home!
Are you here to save me?

Oh, goodness me. You're a friend of Gabriella's, then. Well, I guess we both know why you're here.

Please, relax. Free your mind. Yes, that's it...
There's a cave. No, not a cave. A... home? A place you feel secure. You will find safety there... sanctuary. I see snow, lit by the star of dawn.
And you are not alone. There are others. A child of night... a stalker of the sands? Oh, but before you are family, there will be blood. Such blood.
Wait! There's something else... A potential for adventure, and wealth. It is a ruin, ripe for the plunder. Deepwood Redoubt. Far to the northwest...
Through there is... Hag's End. The last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.
Your destiny is dark. Oh yes, so dark. But much of it has been fulfilled. You have found sanctuary, and the comforting words of a mother's love.
And you have companionship. A child of night, and a stalker of the sands. Together, you are a family.
It is the last resting place of an assassin of old. A Dark Brother, who bequeaths his ancient earthly possessions... to you.
No... no, that is all. Now... now please. I find myself very weary all of sudden.
Oh, very well. But my energies are low. I warn you - I won't be able to see much. Give me... five gold, and I'll do what I can.
Sorry, love, but I'm not a charity.
Are you joking? You just rented a room from me.
Sure thing. It's yours for a day.
What does this look like, the Temple of Mara? No gold, no bed.
Have a good rest. It's the big room with the double bed.

Someone was attacked in the market. Do you know who it was?
I think it was Margret. Poor woman, she was just visiting the city from Cyrodiil.
Yeah, but she was a Nord. And a noble. Perfect Forsworn target.
You're being paranoid. We're in control of Markarth. Not the Forsworn.
The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines. Do you think it's because of the Forsworn threat?
Please. Those savages are no match for us. The Jarl is just biding his time.
Biding his time until what? Until another person is lying dead in the streets? Don't be naive.

Oh yes, Cicero and the Listener! On the hunt!
Off we go.
Oh, but the Listener jests with poor Cicero. You already have company. You don't need my help at all.
I am honored to be chosen.
Lead on, Listener.
But you already have a traveling companion. I fear I would just get in the way.
I am yours, Listener.
Oh, well... You seem to already have assistance. Surely you mean to remain inconspicuous...
Yes, Listener! I will remain in this very spot until you tell me otherwise. Spiders could eat my face off and faithful Cicero would not move an inch!
Yes, Listener. I won't move unless you give the word.
I'll remain in this location until ordered otherwise.
Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!
Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all.
I will return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary immediately, Listener.
Yes, Listener. I'll be here if you need me.
Yes, Listener. I'll return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary without delay.
Of course. But if you need me, just give the order.
Listener!
You were told to find it, weren't you?
If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.
Savos. Before... before he died.
He... He gave me something just a little while ago.
He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came.
I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him.
Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now.
Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us.
I said let's go. Now.

Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be lurking within.
Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party seeking revenge... they were being plagued by nightmares just like the people of Dawnstar.
No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call [QUOTE]The Miasma,[QUOTE] putting everyone to sleep.
Try not to get carried away.
Go. Bring honor to yourself, and the Companions.

Looks like it's going to be a bountiful harvest once again. The gods continue to smile upon us.
It's remarkable that our farms are so prosperous given the harsh winters of late.
Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.
Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.
Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here.
The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.
Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend.
It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.
Father, how old were you when you left home?
I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me.
Exasperated
Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask.

Plaintive, maybe a bit guilty. He was caught doing something he should not have been doing.
I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory.
I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it.
Another fine day at work in the fields. I don't envy those city folk who miss out on the joys of working the land.
I'll tell you who I don't envy - those poor children who lost their parents in this war.
Lives lost, crops burned, land ruined... there's no greater sin than war. And yet, you were an orphan, and you've made something of your life.
I was lucky. If you hadn't rescued me, I'd probably be a thief, a mercenary or something even worse.
It's too fine a day to dwell on such things. Let's get back to work and forget about wars and orphans for awhile.
The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the hold.
Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.
Hey, people have paid money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load.
I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?
Hostile
You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you.

Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting.
Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively before dying. My duty in life and in death is to make sure he stays in this tomb for eternity.
He had a way of enthralling people and built up a loyal army of followers. Good men fell under his spell and were forever twisted. Made... evil.
After that, fear was enough to keep them in line. He could torture and humiliate them and they would not rebel. Even in death, they serve him still.
Good. Here you are. He'll follow you to Oblivion and back, if it comes to that.
Sorry. You already have an animal with you.
War dogs cost gold, friend. Come back when you have some.

But I need your help. We need your help.
Don't worry about me. I know how to lay low.

I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic.
I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.
I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.
The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep.
Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process.
Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged.
Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely.
In some cases, a few never awoke at all.
Welcome to the Imperial Legion, soldier.

Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal.
Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares.
In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara.
Occasionally. But an Orc blade is a very personal thing. Anger, regret, pride. All these things are put into our steel.
When my daughter Lash chose to leave the stronghold, I forged a sword to channel all my shame and grief.

I got a new order in for shields. I'm gonna need some hardwood planks. None of that soft pine this time.

Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here.
They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards... they need to be taught a lesson.
They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.
Oh, yes? I wonder what that old busybody wants now.
Whatever it is, it will have to wait until after I've finished dealing with this dragon situation.
And I'm sure he told you it was urgent. Well, he's not the only Jarl in Skyrim with problems to deal with.
wistfully - he's been desperate for someone to believe him for so long
You'd better come in and tell me how you found me and what you want.
Delphine? How do you ... ? This is just a trick to get me to open the door, eh? I told you to go away!
I hear your heart beat like the Harbingers of old. Your glories in Skyrim are seen and honored.
In life we were enemies, but eternity's too long to hold a grudge - my heart's now free of such old hatreds.
Hero of the Nords I name you, Dragonborn, let none deny it.
The mist is gone! A glorious day!
The World-Eater is dead! The way is now clear!
You saved us all. We will sing of you forever.
Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here.
The three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe.
But if you stray from wisdom then to Sovngarde you will not return.
You freed Svaknir, a fool of a poet, but an honest enemy who has earned my respect.
Sadly, he's now lost in the soul-snaring mist - defeat Alduin, and his doom avert - I hope to greet him in this Hall as a friend.
Far you've travelled, your trials long, to taste of Sovngarde's sweet delights.
Seek ye food or song unending? Fighting, drinking, fellowship and boasting? Find welcome here, and warm your soul.
Hail, Dragonborn. That honor is also mine - to our shared birthright you'll bring new glory!
Dragonborn! Have you come to cleanse Sovngarde at long last of Alduin's foul mist?
Why does Shor forbid us to face Alduin? I fear no worm, World-Eater though he be.
I long to fight that foul worm, but by Shor's command we curb our wrath.
No gloom can hold my heart for long in Shor's bless'd hall, where no shadows lie.
A cup, Dragonborn, to death and glory!
Take your ease, let troubles fade.
By Shor's command we curb our wrath, so we feast and sing, til the final doom.
Shor's power protects this hall; but beyond is fear, brought by Alduin.
Shor's high seat stands empty; his mien is too bright for mortal eyes.
Banners, huh? Trying to pretty up the place? All right, you got it.
That'll come in handy, yeah? An alchemy station, maybe a little garden with some choice plants. All right, consider it done.
Oh ho. Now that's the Dark Brotherhood I know and love. This for business or pleasure? Ah, what's it matter, right? I'll see that it gets done.
Yeah, we can do that. I'm thinking a sewer grate on the outskirts of Dawnstar. Leads to a tunnel, then inside. You'll be in or out, quick as a coney.
Heh. Chamber fit for a king and all that, right? No problem. Give ya a big bed, decorate the room real nice, maybe even throw in a few extra baubles.
Suit yourself.
You're a little light on coin there, my friend. No gold, no refit.
Now, might I offer some advice? You should go to Riften and find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before?
Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, hmm?
You do that, and I'll see what I can do about recruiting some new additions to our Family...
You've come far, mortal, but can you stand against my inner council?  Let's see!
Don't applaud yourself too soon, worm!
Mad with rage
The Forsworn have taken Kolskeggr Mine. We're the only ones left.
Troll's blood, what happened to you Pavo?
Gods.... You two head inside and get some rest. I'll send word to the Jarl.
The question is, what isn't wrong with Riften.
This city is corrupt. Rotten to the core. No one cares about anything except themselves and how much coin they can make off the misery of others.
Authorities? Have you been listening to what I said? They're all dirty. Every one of them.
The only way to get things done in this city is to keep your head down and pay off the right people.
Of course. Nothing gets done without my approval in this city. I have the Jarl's ear, and the guards in my pocket.
Anyone makes trouble for me and I pay a visit to the Thieves Guild. Make me angry and I contact the Dark Brotherhood.
You'd do well to remember that the next time you make such a stupid observation.
The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit.
I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.
And you think that I care? Interesting.
I don't believe in getting my hands dirty. You have people that handle those sort of things... use them.
Mara's domain encompasses the emotions we strive the most to embrace; love, compassion and understanding.
It's difficult to appreciate her gifts in these dark times, but you should consider her light a beacon in the storm.
This heap of matchsticks is what everyone calls Haelga's Bunkhouse. Can you stay here? No.
The Bunkhouse is for the working man, not some sort of a luxury inn for tourists.
Of course not. You expect me to take care of it by myself?
My niece Svana helps me with the chores. She'd be more help if she kept her head out of the clouds.
She's been with me ever since her parents were killed by bandits and she was dropped in my lap.
Well, I'd better get back to work. You two make yourselves at home.
Well, I'd better get some sleep. Don't mind me, though. You two make yourselves at home.
This is it men! It's time to make this city ours!
The faster we take them out, the faster we can claim this city as ours!
Beyond that are two exterior gates. Find a way to open them and we can take this city!
All that remains then is the exterior gate. Find a way through to open it and the city will be ours!
Our ancient debt for Alduin's reprieve is now repaid - the long night is ended!
I'll look for you, friend, when at last you return to Shor's hall. The honor will be ours when you rejoin the ranks of Sovngarde.

Dammit...
I think this might be the end...

Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.
Your guy's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens and paying us good coin for nobody to know about it. Well, until now that is.
Tell you what. Go ahead and deal with your business for now. When you're done, find me and we'll deal with mine.
I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it?
Just coat your weapon with it. Then... you get the idea.

Gods, I'll be glad to see the last of Skyrim.
Cynical
I think we'll all feel better once we're back out to sea. Won't be long now.
I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely.
Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.
I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way.
Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content.
I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent.
The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife.
This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance.
If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle.
Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day.
Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.
content for the first time in your life
I only hope that this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning.
Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known.
There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking.
We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do.
Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look at how it shines.
But our work is just beginning. Approach me, Listener, and hear my words.
Yet another child has prayed to their mother.
Speak with the Nervous Patron at Candlehearth Hall, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Wary Outlaw at the Bee and Barb, in Riften. Accept his gold, and then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Corrupt Agent at the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, in Dragon Bridge. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!
Speak with the Scheming Servant at the Keep in Markarth. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Desperate Gambler at the Barracks, in Windhelm. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Blasphemous Priest at the Temple of Kynareth, in Whiterun. Accept his gold, then kill the target. Hail Sithis!
Speak with the Dishonored Skald at the Bards College, in Solitude. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Indolent Farmer at the Vilemyr Inn, in Ivarstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
Speak with the Griefstricken Chef, at the Windpeak Inn, here in Dawnstar. Accept his gold, then eliminate the target. Hail the Listener! Hail Sithis!
Speak with the Unemployed Laborer at the Frostfruit Inn, in Rorikstead. Accept his gold, then kill the target. So begins a contract, bound in blood.
At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.
Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined.
Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done.
suddenly depressed
You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices.
Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own... don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.
But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.
Think about the Guild... about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard.
A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment...
Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.
Precisely. There are a few who still call Nocturnal [QUOTE]Lady Luck[QUOTE] and for good reason.
Powerful and full of malice. The person you're talking to is just a play thing.

Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible.
From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself... well... dying.
The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere... a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam.
When Mercer stole the Key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her.
I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll.
Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.
With the Ebonmere closed, and their sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change.
They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.
My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed.
However, ever since that day, I've felt my power waning... slowly draining away.
Ha! You can't resist, can you?
Let's see... this one, I think. J'zargo has designed it to be an excellent flame cloak, with a twist.
It is especially potent against the undead, and should burn them to a crisp in no time.
J'zargo gives you plenty of these scrolls, so you try them and return when you can say whether they work.
I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from that cave! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!
Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. Dragon Bridge is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense.
Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.
J'zargo has worked hard on learning new spells, trying new things. This will make J'zargo stand out as a mage.
But J'zargo works so hard, there is no time to test these new spells. If you help with the testing, this will make learning easier.
J'zargo will give you scrolls, you will use them and report the results. This is a good plan, no?
You tell J'zargo when you are ready.
What the... we've been betrayed! Look out!
There he is! Get him!
Treachery! Attack!

What are you lookin' at?
J'zargo is eager to hear how the scrolls are working.
It is difficult to admit, but J'zargo could still use some help.
Can you... can you possibly help J'zargo?
J'zargo has seen that Tolfdir likes you.
You must be very skilled with magic, yes?
J'zargo is working hard, but cannot do it alone. Can you help with this?
This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be cautious.

My favorite drinking buddy! Let's get some mead.
Not now. If I don't pull night duty, I'll drink a round with you at the Sleeping Giant.
But I'm thirsty now.
You're always thirsty. Just like you're always drunk. Now let me get back to my rounds.
Not this again.
If he does, tell him how bad the food is. And how dangerous it is.

Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...
It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of.
The Jarl has put out a bounty on some bandits. Here, take a look at this decree for details.
My Amulet of Arkay. It's the source of my divine powers and also a sacred badge of office.
I misplaced it in the catacombs. I'd look for it, but I've been hearing noises down there. I fear the dead have become... restless.
Without that amulet, I'm powerless to confront them. Would you be willing to search for it?
I believe I am, yes. Technically speaking, of course. The city is also home to a priest, priestess, an alchemist, and I'm sure others who practice.
Ah, that reminds me. Speaking of alchemists, I have some frost salts for Arcadia. She asked me to obtain them for one of her potions.
Would you be so kind as to deliver the frost salts for me? I'm sure Arcadia will provide some form of recompense...
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other. Maybe I'll test it on Farengar first...
Oh, but I suppose you expect some compensation. Um... here, these potions should suffice.
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's for a special brew I'm working on. A love elixir like none other.
You did what?
By the gods, you're serious. You'd better report this to Commander Maro right away. He's at the Penitus Oculatus outpost, up in Dragon Bridge.
The leader of the Dark Brotherhood? You mean Astrid? Dead? And this is no jest?
Ha! This is a stroke of good fortune. Long have I watched the Dark Brotherhood's movements... waiting for the time to strike. That time is now!
My agents have recently acquired the passphrase to their Sanctuary. It is, [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Every assassin in that hole must be put down!
You, my friend. You've slain their leader. This honor should be yours. Do this, and you will be rewarded most handsomely!
We have a chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, forever. It's all up to you.
By all I hold holy... Can it be true? Have you actually done it?
This is a great day, my friend. You have struck a blow against darkness that will not soon be forgotten! Here, as promised - a most generous reward!
I'll make sure the Emperor himself hears of all you've accomplished. You've made Skyrim a better place.

Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing.
We have to catch up to him before it's too late.
Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?
Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.
Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.
So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.
The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer.
We'll have to find another way around.
Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.
I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.
Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.
It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.
We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you.
We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lass. We're right behind you.
This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.
The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.
This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.
Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.
There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.
Aye. Whatever you want to do, we're with you.
Falmer patrol up ahead. I don't think they know we're here.
He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.
Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.
I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.
It's Mercer! Look... down there!
Damn it! There's no way through.
He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.
Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him.
Wait a moment... what's that?
I'm on it, lass.
Yeah, but raising Draugr to take on both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks? That's just crazy.
True, but I'm not going to be the one to try to oppose her...
You may have noticed the College, just to the north there. Very prestigious place. Mages from all over Tamriel traveled here to seek knowledge.
After the Oblivion Crisis was over, many felt that magic users were to blame. Elves, to be specific. It created a great deal of tension.
A good many dark elves were driven from the city, and people became... uncomfortable with the presence of the College.
Just about eighty years ago, there was a terrible disaster. The cliffs overlooking the Sea of Ghosts collapsed, taking most of Winterhold with them.
In the middle of it all, the College was practically untouched. Many of the survivors were suspicious.
Some believed the mages were behind the whole thing, and others felt they could have at least prevented it.
Arch-Mage Aren assures me that his people had nothing to do with it, and I believe him. But Winterhold never recovered.
Goodness, no!
They're simply scholars, they mean no one harm. I've had... several conversations with Arch-Mage Aren over the years.
He's perfectly polite, if a bit guarded.
Better make sure.
I'm sure I heard something...
Nothing yet.
Could have been my imagination, I suppose...
Hmm. I don't see anything.
That's strange...
Running won't save you.
Got to be here somewhere...
You should run while you have the chance.
Maybe they're gone?
Who's there?
Hold on, what was that?
Did you hear that?
I'm going to check that out.
Must be my mind playing tricks on me.
Hmm, nothing there after all.
Nothing there. Strange.
I must be getting jumpy.
Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
I've waited an eternity for this day.
My debt is repaid at last.
That takes care of that.
I can always use the practice.
That's how it's done.
I was just getting warmed up.
Another one for the Blades.
That's the end of that, hmm?
That seems to be all of them.
A shame it had to come to that.
Seems I still remember my old training.
I'm getting too old for this.
Where'd you go?
Anyone see anything?
I'm afraid I've lost them.
Must still be here, somewhere...
Don't let your guard down.
You think running will save you?
Well, good. They're gone.
I think they're gone.
I don't see 'em any more.
Stay alert. They may not have gone far.
Hmm. Gone. I don't like it.
Oho, so that's where you went.
Here we go again.
You should have run away.
Now you're mine!
grunt of pain
Damn it.
You'll have to do better than that.
Not bad... but it won't save you.
I'm too old for this.
Damn you.
I could use some help over here!
Aye, that I do. I've got to, if I hope to be as good as Eorlund Gray-Mane some day. In fact, I just finished my best piece of work.
It's a sword. I made it for the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater. It's a surprise, and I don't even know if he'll accept it. But...
Listen, could you take the sword to my father, Proventus Avenicci? He's the Jarl's steward. He'll know the right time to present it to him.
From Adrianne?
Ah, this must be that weapon for the Jarl. Poor girl, so eager to prove herself. I'll present it to Balgruuf when his mood is... agreeable.
Thank you. Please, take these few coins, for services rendered.
A fateful errand.  No few have chafed to face the Worm since first he set his soul-snare here at Sovngarde's threshold.
But Shor restrained our wrathful onslaught - perhaps, deep-counselled, your doom he foresaw.
No shade are you, as usually here passes, but living, you dare the land of the dead.
Ah, my parlor. No finer place to boil eyes, no...
Frothing with rage
I spit on you, dead sister.
Fools! You will not hold me here any longer, Valdar!
Yes, markedly so. Ulfric and his Stormcloaks made no secret of their disdain for the Dark Elves.
In fact, they didn't seem to care much for anyone who wasn't a Nord.
The folk of the Empire have always had a more cosmopolitan view of the world, so I'm glad to see them in charge.
A little bit angry
I'm joking, of course, but I'm a lot happier seeing the Empire running things in Windhelm.
Well, not yet. The Empire hasn't been in charge for that long, and real change takes time.
Still, having a just and honorable man like Brunwulf in charge can only be an improvement.
Unlike Ulfric, Brunwulf has shown a great willingness to work with the other races and make us feel more at home here.
A mix of relief and optimism.
In some ways, yes, but there is often opportunity in chaos.
When a new government takes charge, records can be lost, taxes can be forgotten and laws aren't always enforced.
The new guards are often too busy learning their responsibilities to notice a few smuggled goods or minor robberies.
Trying a little too hard to sound innocent.
I almost didn't. I wasn't sure I could stomach having some Imperial tell me how to live my life.
I was ready to pack my things when Hermir came to me. She wanted to make sure I'd finish teaching her the smithing trade.
That girl's determination won me over. I suppose it didn't hurt that she said she only wanted to learn from the best smith in Skyrim.
I couldn't let her run off to that pretender Eorlund Gray-Mane, could I?
Aye, that I do. I ain't sayin' he was perfect, but he knew what it meant to be a Nord.
The Empire's always taken us for granted. Nords died by the thousands in the Great War, and what did the Empire do?
They outlawed the worship of Talos, Skyrim's most beloved son. There's thanks for you.
I guess what I'm sayin' is, Ulfric stood up for us, an' for all Skyrim. So who's goin' to stand up for us now?
I don't care what the Imperials say -- when Ulfric Stormcloak died, one of Skyrim's greatest heroes was lost.
The last line should have some bite to it. There's a bitter anger at work here.
Determined and angry.  A sort of [QUOTE]we'll show them![QUOTE] tone.
Angry, with a zealous bent.
Every day is a struggle, but a Nord doesn't back down from a fight when the cause is honorable.
I just wish things were simpler. In my days as a soldier, I knew who the enemy was, and how to defeat him.
Unfortunately, a sword can't repair damaged buildings, feed hungry people or undo years of prejudice.
I'd like to, but it's not as simple as that.
Most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted.
Until those people learn to accept the Argonians, they must remain outside, for their own safety.
Old habits don't die easily, and we Nords can be as stubborn as stone.
I've taken the first steps toward doing so already.
I met with several of the Dark Elves to discuss improvements in the Gray Quarter, but we have no real plans as of yet.
First we'll need to refill our coffers and stockpile stone and wood. The war took a heavy toll on Windhelm's resources.
But I swore an oath to our Dunmer friends that, for as long as I sit on the throne of Windhelm, their needs will not be ignored.
By inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the Sea Squall as strictly as she ran the house.
I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems.
Take the last trade we did. Some Fine-Cut Void Salts from the College of Winterhold. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.
Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave.
If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those salts.
Your choice, friend.
That's the first bit of good news I've had since I set sail a year ago.
Here's your cut.
The North Wind is my mistress, and I'm her master. I don't tolerate any disloyalty.
You looking for work? Got a sailor who thought running a gang of thieves would be more money than hauling my cargo.
You make an example of that gang, I'll give you a year's worth of pay.
That's the spirit.
Coward.
Fine work. Here's your pay. Don't spend it all on mead.
Oh yes. You're a fine fat one, aren't you!
Give me just one... little... bite!
Ah, yes. No fat on this one!
Don't run. Stay for dinner!
I've been waiting for you, my sweet one.
Come closer!
No, no, no. I've got more blood than you know!
Winterhold has lost much of its history, and with that much of its power. I aim to change that.
I've heard rumors of the resting place of the Helm of Winterhold, the very same helm that Jarl Hanse wore in the First Era.
Hanse was in line to be High King of Skyrim, you know. Having that might get the ear of the other Holds and give me some authority.
Good. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for your return.
Then I have no work for you.
Can you believe that this hold used to contend for the throne of the High King? Now perhaps others will listen.
Here, your reward as promised. You have Winterhold's thanks.
Good luck to you.
As you wish.
If I needed something from you, you would know it.
Nothing. I'm busy, and I don't like being bothered unless I'm expecting something from you.
Oh, don't give me that look. Fine. I supposed I can find some menial task to set your mind on. Hmm....
We have something of a vampire problem. Bodies have been found with blood drained. I know of a den nearby you can wipe out as a precaution.
I don't expect you to be capable of even that.
Filthy creatures, aren't they? Living in the darkness, like they do. So uncivilized.
I prefer finery. Like this. Here, for your trouble. And I suppose I should show you a little about Illusion magic for free, shouldn't I?
As you were, then.
Fine, then.
The honor will be mine.
Good. Honor to you.
Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you.
That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.
A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you.
I guess you don't hear too well. I never heard of this [QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] of yours.
Well... when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about.
You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.
Maybe it would. If you had it.
There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.
You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.
Easy there. I don't want that kind of trouble. Guy ain't worth it.
gleefully - he loves a good brawl
Ah... so tender. Come here, you juicy morsel!
Go away. Go away. Go away!
It's hopeless. He told me. He's right, you know.
Their fires lit up the night. All across Lake Rumare, like stars come to earth. It was beautiful, really.
They were golden, even when they were dead. But their blood was red. I knew it would be.
You don't think there's any hope, do you? I don't. He's right.
He explained it all to me. Before, when I still understood. I don't remember, but I still know.
He'll tell you. Just ask. You don't even need to ask. He'll tell you anyway.
I finally understand what it all means. What it was all for. The killing. And the dying.
I had a medal. It had someone's face on it. I threw it away, after. It didn't help.
gleefully
I'm going to eat well tonight, my darling!
No! You can't be here! You're all dead! I already killed you over and over!
You will not stop me from killing those who wage this pointless war!
Thank you for releasing us from her spell.
Now we can rest in peace once again. Come Fjori, my love...
Let me see that journal...
reassuring
Agreed, we can't afford to try again.
Are you here to help?
I will take back my family's castle.
Good, the place is crawling with bandits.  We lost some good men trying to take it earlier.
I suspect Brurid planned this, there's been bad blood between us since the king's death.
But to invade my home, kidnap my family...
slightly impatient
The front gate is locked so you'll need to use the mine entrance behind us.  Open the front gate and we'll try and give you some support.
My family is everything to me.  Clear the fort and on top of the posted reward you can have whatever items you'd like.
Only if I can help it.
But damn if I ain't almost sober.
Hey. In the Bannered Mare, there's this bottle of Argonian Ale. The good stuff. Get it for me. They won't even know it's gone. Come on...
Well that all depends on you, now. Doesn't it?
Sleazy and scary.

Hey friend, you wouldn't happen to be looking for unusual items would you?
First off, let's keep this between us. I picked these up from the graves in town so don't go blabbing about it to Kust.
You have to understand, Gentle Repose is a fallow festering place I should have left a long time ago. This is one of the few ways I make any money.
Right now I've got a book that I think you might like.
Yeah, if your interested then I'll give you the book for free. If you like it you can come back later and I'll have other stuff.
I mean, it don't cost me anything to let you have one and the dead won't notice their stuff missing. heh.
Great.  Here you go. Come back later and I'll have other things.
I knew something was up. I'll make sure he doesn't disrespect this place anymore. Honesty is a rare thing to find these days. Thank you.
Burying the past is much harder than burying remains. I'm... I'm afraid of what you will think of me if I tell you about the things I've done.
Although I have not practiced in a long time I was once a wizard. Even when I was young my magic was undeniably powerful.
It was that power that brought me to the attention of the Thalmor. In the Summerset Isles it is a great honor to be chosen to serve the Thalmor.
They are the governing council of the Aldmeri Dominion. They lead us to attack the Empire and forced the Empire to agree to stop worshiping Talos.
It was during the war with the Empire that I was at the height of my power. As a Thalmor battlemage I laid waste the enemy.
Men, women, children, no one was spared my wrath. I destroyed whole villages.
I dream about those days still. Except I'm not me. I can see myself there and I try to stop what I know is going to happen but...
Many of the Empire's troops were Nords at that point. Some of them could even have been from around here.
Thank you. May Arkay bless you. I won't forget this.
I knew he was troubled but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
I knew he was troubled, but one of the Thalmor? I wish I could say I did not believe it. Thank you for telling me.
You - over here, quick. Before any of them show up!
Please, stranger! I need your help!
I will find you, Fjola!
Starting a test
Again!
Good. We'll take a short break, then move on to wide-area destruction spells.
How do you manage to hold your ground like that?
You have to remember, it's not about strength. It's about leverage.
But strength doesn't hurt.
Well, no. I'm just saying there's more to defense than muscle.
I've heard some rumors... about you and Skjor.
And if you want to keep having ears, you'll pretend you didn't.
Is it not allowed?
It's not exactly forbidden, but even so... it's not true. So that's that.
You only use the little swords.
It's called a shortsword, oaf. It's quicker. Sharper. Like a razorfish against a whale.
But whales eat razorfish.
And they always come to regret it.
You might do well to learn a smaller weapon. Vary your style a bit.
Tiny blades don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.
But ten little cuts...
All I need is one to cut you in half.
put a nervous gulp before the line
You'll do all right some day. Today you need to keep training, though.
Enough with the training. I want to go fight something.
No fighting just yet. Not till Skjor says so. We train now.
emphasize [QUOTE]get[QUOTE]
But before I fought, I had to train.
Relax, new blood.
I've been hunting on my own for years.
Fighting people is different. Smarter.
Some of them, anyway.
You wanted to see me?
[QUOTE]out[QUOTE] is kind of italicized. they're talking around the issue.
Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle.
You forget yourself, young one.
suitably chastised
That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.
How goes the hunt?
Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.
What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!
Always.
How are the young ones coming along?
Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.
I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down.
I hope so.
Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you.
What weapon do you like, Harbinger?
When I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer.
Big swords should always beat little swords.
Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.
Tradition is very important to me, son.
To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.
If you want to lead this pack when I'm gone, you have to see farther. Look closer.
Well which is it? Look farther or closer?
Come on now, boy, you know what I meant...
You speak in riddles sometimes.
I don't mean to confuse you.
It's not confusing... just frustrating.
You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle.
But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.
Don't worry about me.
Master, I...
My title is Harbinger, child. I am no man's master.
Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to.
No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman.
Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?
Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him.
Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.
Do you think I could be a member of the Circle? Some day? If I work hard?
Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you.
I just want to make sure I'm moving up.
This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks.
But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?
I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.
Why can't I train with Aela?
Because you wanted to learn the longer blades. Aela's never used anything bigger than a dagger.
It's just... I think our fighting styles are similar.
Well you can either get better with a bow or try to learn from me.
Should I be holding the blade further away than I would a smaller one?
If you keep it in close, you'll have more control, but it can be harder to balance a strike.
I guess that comes down to footwork, then.
Exactly. When you have a big heavy weight swinging around your upper body, your lower body has to compensate or you'll fall right over.
It just feels so slow.
It will feel that way for a while. But eventually you'll get used to it, and then you'll get faster with it.
After that, the shortsword will feel like a knitting needle when you pick it up again.
I've never held a knitting needle.
Of course not. My mistake.
Are you prepared for tonight's hunt?
I've been thinking we need to be more... discreet.
There's nothing wrong with what we're doing.
You know the old man doesn't like it.
Let's just not be too obvious.
All these younglings scampering around.
Worried one of them is going to take your place?
Some of them might try. But that's not what I'm worried about.
What then?
That they might get themselves killed.
By you?
They should be so lucky.
Heard you had a bit of trouble near Solitude last week.
Just those same ruffians I was bringing in for the Shatter-Shields.
So much wasted breath in that crew.
I'm imagining you just standing your ground and letting them tire themselves out.
I'm telling you, it works. Let them ring their own ears on my shield, then scoop them up off the ground.
We all have different means to glory, Stonearm. Well done.
I've got a bad grip on my shield, could you take a look at it?
I'm a warrior, not a blacksmith.
Can't you just tell me if the grip is bad?
If Eorlund made it, it's more likely you're gripping it wrong. Find me tomorrow and we can go over it.
One day when you and I are on the Circle, we can change how things are run around here.
I don't think that's how the Circle works.
They're lording it over us all the time, though.
Young warriors are smart to listen to older ones. They've lived.
What kind of weapon do you prefer? I like the smaller, quicker blades.
Yes, you're very fond of saying that. You know I like hammers and axes.
Aren't they slow? I can get in and out before you have one swing.
Let's test that out some time.
Yeah? Why?
Okay, okay! I'll leave him alone! I was just kidding around. Besides, if he'd only kiss me, I wouldn't have to beat him up all the time...
Yes. Braith bullies me all the time. All the elders think I'm a milk drinker 'cause I can't fight. Nobody understands.
If you can get Braith to leave me alone, I'll be your best friend... forever! I'll pay you, too! My whole life's savings - two septims!
I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.
Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk.
They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.
That's right. Old inn to the south. The oaf doesn't even bother to visit these days. What am I supposed to do if the dragons burn down the farm?
You're a traveler, right? I have this letter for him. Let him know how much of a failure he is.
Good. You make sure the lug tips you when he gets it.
Typical. Well don't mind me, then.
What's this?
I guess some things never change. Thanks for bringing this to me. Here, for your trouble.
Well, there are three of them. Arranged in three tiers, as you may have noticed.
The Plains District is so named because it's the closest of the three to the plains that surround the city. The inn and marketplace are found there.
Most of the city's residents live in the Wind District, which is the middle of the three.
Dragonsreach occupies the highest, which we call the Cloud District. From here, the Jarl can see all that goes on within his city.
Ulfric Stormcloak's head on a pike.
Do you think Ulfric really cares about Skyrim's independence, or the welfare or its people? I promise you, he doesn't.
He's nothing more than a barbarian renegade, whose lust for power has cost the lives of countless innocents.
With good planning and constant vigilance.
Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors.
We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back.
Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do.
We must have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack.
Ah, splendid! Our fine city has a proud history, and I'm happy to share what I know.
The history of Whiterun begins with Jorrvaskr, the hall of the Companions. For a long time, it was the only building on the mountain.
As time passed, a thriving community sprang up around Jorrvaskr, as was common with mead halls.
Today, Whiterun is the jewel of Skyrim. I can say without boast that is the greatest city in all the holds.
That is an old tale, but well known to those of us who serve in the keep.
Long ago, there lived a mighty hero of the Nords. Olaf One-Eye. Olaf did battle with a fearsome dragon named Numinex.
The struggle between Olaf and the dragon culminated in a mighty duel atop Mount Anthor, with Olaf the victor.
Olaf returned in triumph to Whiterun. By his decree, the city's keep was rebuilt as a prison for Numinex.
And so, from that time until this, our great keep has been called [QUOTE]Dragonsreach.[QUOTE]
Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war.
When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue.
Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so.
I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.
Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers.
Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade.
Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead.
And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.
Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them.
Well, not yet, anyway.
Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure.
Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did.
What a fascinating conversation that would be!
If I said that was a tedious question, would you be smart enough to know what I meant? Probably not.
As long as I'm left alone to pursue my research, I don't care who gives the orders.
Now, I'm a busy man and your pointless questions are boring me terribly. Good day.
I'll put it simply, so you'll understand. I advise the Jarl in matters of magic.
If the hold is faced with any threats or mysteries of a magical nature, I am called upon to explain things and suggest a course of action.
Hopefully that answer will satisfy you. Good day.
Hello, my friend! If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person.
In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts.
Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire.
In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name.
So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines.
If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject.
Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward!
Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the [QUOTE]White-Gold Concordat.[QUOTE]
Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price.
Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!
Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat.
Indeed. The temple here in the city is my charge.
The goddess's divine blessings have no doubt helped make Whiterun a thriving and prosperous city.
After all, it is she who brings rain to our crops and fair weather on the harvest days.
Somewhat, yes. At first it seemed a distant thing, heard only in the idle speech of guards and traders.
When the wounded soldiers began to return from battle, I did what I could to help them.
As more of the sick and injured came to the temple, my work as a healer became more important than my duties as a priestess.
I wish only an end to the fighting, so that I can tend to the temple once more.

It's my wife, Fjola!  I think she's being held in this tower.
I'm sorry, I'm just... you're right. Let me explain.
Fjola, my wife, left the farm on errands and never came back. It's been months, and I've been searching for her since.
I heard a rumor that these bandits were ransoming captives, so I thought she may be here.
I managed to sneak past the guards and get this far, but... I don't think I can go on. I'm no warrior! Please, can you look for her?
with some doubt, but trying to sound confident
Thank you! I don't have much, but I can give you some coin for the trouble.
One of the guards dropped this key while I hid. I wager it will come in handy for you. Please hurry!
Until you can find out whether Fjola is here there's nothing I care to to discuss.
hopeful excitement
Overwhelming grief
trying to recover himself
All right, snowback. Who are you, and what are you doing in my tower?
Fjola?  How do you know that name?
Genuine surprise that her husband's here.
The fool's my husband. I'm Fjola - or I was, once. Don't you see?
I left that old scab. Came home to Skyrim, and found this rabble of bandits.
Didn't take much to prove myself and knock them into shape. Now every free blade from here to Windhelm wants to sign on for a piece.
And it won't end here. I'd die before I went back.
None. Not back to him.
Better men have tried. Let's finish this.
You think so? Let's see who the real woman is here.
I don't know. I never expected the old bag to follow me so far. Just get rid of him.
But don't kill him. I don't hate the man. I just want him to go back to his farm and forget about me.
Take my wedding band. Stuhn only knows why I've kept it this long. He'll recognize it. Tell him whatever you think will convince him to leave.
The ring itself is worth a few bits. Keep it as thanks for cutting off the last vestige of an unwanted fate.
Her marriage band? Then there's hope - she was here!
I have to move on if I want to find her. Please, take the coin I promised. Blessings of Stendarr on you!

[QUOTE]doting husband[QUOTE] with some sarcasm
Oh, it's you. I didn't think you could handle this on your own. Did you get rid of Christer?
How did... no, forget it. I don't care to know. I'm free of the little man, and that's what matters.
I owe you a debt, and I aim to repay it. We'll see each other again someday. For now, goodbye, and thanks.
Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back...
You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?
Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there.
By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel.
Battle-Born! Give me your money!
I... I don't have any money.
You'd better give me five septims right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...
No! Please! I really don't have any money, Braith! I'll give you ten septims tomorrow. Just don't hit me.
Ten septims tomorrow, baby Battle-Born. Or I'm gonna bloody your nose and your lip.
We're going to make them pay.
Those bastards will regret raising their weapons against Jorrvaskr.
Let's get back to Jorrvaskr. We'll want to pay our respects to Kodlak's spirit.
What is this, you think you're clever?
If you want to fight your way out of here, you have to do it in the Pit.
Gotta give the crowd a show.
Luckily there's no shortage of Pit bait around here. Now get in there and earn your freedom.
All right, meat, it's time for you to earn your freedom.
Well aren't you in luck. He's the next piece of gutter scum on the docket. Between you and me, I hope you cleave his arrogant head open.
All right. Head to the pit when you think you're ready.
We don't just let people rot in cells until they've served their time. Here, you fight.
If you win, you go free.
If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of Sovngarde if you're lucky.
Thank you, thank you. No, please, hold your applause.
One more song, what say you? Yeah? All right, then!
Nnnnooowwwwwww....
There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!
And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made!
But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...
[QUOTE]Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed![QUOTE]
And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
Thank you, good patrons of the Bannered Mare! Thank you!
relieved and still afraid
Draugr creeping down the mountain to climb through my window at night, that kind of thing. I admit, I still don't much like the look of it.
I guess you get used to it.
You visit us often, Thadgeir.
Most of my friends are buried here.
There are a lot of good men buried here, Kust.
Men aren't good or bad. They're just men.
The fields will need cutting soon.
I suppose so. Seems like it was just turning summer yesterday.
And now winter is coming.
Narri! This mead tastes like water and the meat has gone off.
The mead is same as it ever was and the meat is fresh, maybe your sense of taste has [QUOTE]gone off.[QUOTE]
The impertinence! You never would have talked to me like that when I was Jarl.
We had this same argument every week, even when you were Jarl.
Tekla! It's good to see you, girl. How's Dengeir treating you?
As he should I suppose.
Hmmm, well don't take what you don't have to.
Narri, do you think the war will ever end?
I think the war is just an excuse. If it does end there will be a new reason and a new place.
But what about the banning of Talos worship? Isn't that worth fighting about?
I don't know about you, tekla, but all my prayers are silent and who I pray to is still my own to decide.
Leave me alone, Lod.
Ah Tekla, you're a pretty little mouse.
Alright, but if you ever want to leave that old curmudgeon I've got plenty for you to do at Gentle Repose.
I wish I could afford to pay you both, Narri.  I really do.
At some point we should hire Tekla on here. If she could just spend less time serving Dengeir...
Keep them coming and keep them strong, Valga.
Will do.
The way this war is going you'll soon have plenty of veterans like me to buy drinks.
The way this war is going there might not be anyone left to drink soon.
Hey gossip, bring me a drink.
Bolund, you're going to die of thirst if you keep calling me that.
Hey, Lod, how is the worst farmer in the hold doing?
The Gentle Repose is barren, it was barren the day my father claimed the land and it's barren now.
Sure it is, Lod. Sure it is.
Do you ever get tired of long nights at the mill, Zaria?
Do you ever get tired of the long days on the farm, Mathias?
Yes, yes I do.
Mathies. I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened to your girl.
How's the Corpselight treating you Mathies?
That's kind of you, Lod.
You know how farming is here, long days and little to show for it.
Do you think Tekla has been talking to Siddgeir again?
We've been over this, Den. Tekla does not share your secrets with Siddgeir.
Hmmf. Maybe you're the one talking to him then...
Tekla. The Hall is filthy. See to your cleaning.
Yes sir.
Don't let my brother get to you, Tekla. You're doing a fine job around here.
Thank you sir.
Falkreath is a fine place to be, Bolund.
Another day in this graveyard.
Falkreath is where people go to die. We could be fighting, taking back Nord land!
Falkreath is our home, a place where we have good jobs under a good Jarl. Until the war comes to us we stay put.
Ah, Indara. Arkay's blessing upon you and your husband. Spend as much time here as you need.
Thank you, Runil. Your support means much to us.
The temple is the one place my wife finds peace these days, Runil.
It is a hard time for all of us. I hope that you too can find some sanctuary here, Mathies.
The graveyard has been lonely. Few pay homage to the dead.
Few want to be reminded of mortality in a time of war, Kust.
Preparing the defenses is almost impossible lately, every time we get a new war report our needs change.
The trade routes are affected as well. Procuring supplies is a guessing game. Weapons sell well though.
Mmmm, careful with that, Nenya, our merchants could be selling weapons to an invading force.
Why have taxes not come in from Granite Hill, Nenya? We should send some guards down there.
They are only a little late, Jarl. The trade routes are affected by the war, we should give them another day.
Very well, but when their emissary arrives I want words with him.
Helvard! The guards are looking sloppy today. I want you to reduce their wages for the month.
Sir, I will shape them up but with the war on it is unwise to reduce their wages any further.
We can't afford to lose any men if we wish to keep Falkreath protected.
I would think a man of your military training would be able to do with less but so be it.
Yes. Their history and culture is all around us in Markarth. A race of stonecutters, artisans, and engineers.
They invented machines and built elaborate underground cities where they researched powers to rival the gods themselves.
And then, at a time we are still not sure when, they disappeared. The whole people, all at once. Leaving behind only their works.
Ah, now that is a good question. Where does Hogni get the finest, freshest meat from all over the Reach?
The answer is simple. Orcs. There is a stronghold nearby whose hunters can butcher a deer in seconds.
Now having an Orc for a wife would be something, yes. Strong and bulky. Too bad they don't let people go beyond the walls.
Let me show you where they are. Maybe they welcome you. Maybe they put an arrow in your face. Who knows?
It all started here. This rebellion. When the Empire lost the Reach during the Great War, we became desperate.
We promised a group of Nord militia free worship in exchange for their help retaking the Hold. Then the Elves found out about it.
We were forced to arrest all of them. Ulfric Stormcloak, their leader, used the whole thing as proof that the Empire had abandoned Skyrim.
The rebels called it [QUOTE]The Markarth Incident.[QUOTE] It was the founding day for the Stormcloaks, and where this war really started.
The White-Gold Concordat. Our treaty with the Elves after the Great War forbids free worship of Talos.
But that's what we promised Ulfric and his men. It seems foolish looking back, but at the time we were hoping the Elves wouldn't find out.
So when they did find out, it was either we arrest Ulfric and the militia, or enter into yet another war with the Aldmeri Dominion.
The choice was clear. And now, Ulfric threatens the thinly veiled peace we sacrificed so much for.
When the Aldmeri Dominion invaded the Imperial City, the Legion all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces.
Many of the disgruntled natives of the Reach used the opportunity to depose the Empire, and founded what they called an independent kingdom.
It was little more than a chaotic uprising, but the Reach was removed from Imperial authority for two years before we reclaimed it.
But the leaders of the uprising refused our offers of peace. They fled into the hills and became the Forsworn.
Yes, I know. We have some advantages if they come here. The city is built into the mountainside, so it's hard to reach into even from the skies.
And everything is made of stone. Even the beds. We'll have no trouble from dragon's fire here.
A heathen. Lovely. Oh, don't put on that angry look. I'm just teasing you.
Dibella is the Divine of Beauty. She is a patron deity to artists and bards and those who seek life's simple pleasures.
The temple offers her blessings to pilgrims and instruction in enjoying all life has to offer.
Well, you are lovely to look at, and there's so many things I could teach you, but I'm afraid the Temple isn't taking in new students.
The Imperials were weak. They created this Forsworn problem, but now that we're in charge we'll solve it.
Once the war is over, I'll petition Ulfric to send the militia and we'll cleanse the Reach of this menace.
Then the Forsworn will be where they belong. In the mines, bringing us wealth.
The stone structure the Dwarves have left makes us invincible. Let the dragons singe a few carpets. They'll never topple Markarth.
Through neglect. During the Great War, they let the unwashed natives retake the Reach and declare their own sovereignty.
The Stormcloaks were forced to retake the Reach on our own, but that taste of independence emboldened them. And the Forsworn were born.
In the end, we took back Markarth, but those damn Forsworn still stalk the hills and roads, looking for revenge.
If you could call it that. The Jarl can make all the demands in the world, I'm not setting one foot on the battlefield.
I fought in the Great War. I cut enough young lives short, I'm not going to do it again.
The Stormcloaks are destined to win this fight. Talos is with us, and when you fight under a Divine's blessing, victory is assured.
Dawnstar has a history of being the site of battles that have crippled the fate of the Empire. I hope this remains true.
The only reason dragons are attacking is because Talos is angry with us for turning our backs on him.
As soon as we drive the Empire out of Skyrim, the dragons will vanish. Mark my words.
Yes. Ever since mother died a few winters ago. I play songs and help with the drinks when I have the time.
The Empire has stretched itself too far. This rebellion in Skyrim is one problem, but solving it won't fix everything.
But that's the kind of talk an old warhorse shouldn't be making. Don't worry. I have my problems with the Empire, but I'm still a soldier first.
We'll keep peace and order in Dawnstar.
No. We're completely exposed. Bows and arrows are in short supply. Every building is made of thatch and wood.
I've given standing orders to the guards to prepare water bucket runs to the harbor in case of a fire, but that's all we can do.
Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here.
Thanks to your efforts, the Guild's been restored to it's full strength and you've exposed the traitor in our midst.
As a result, we both feel that you'd make an excellent replacement for Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.
Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full strength.
As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.
I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder.
I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know.
I've never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't want it.
Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild.
And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess.
I can't think of anyone better.
Then it's decided. When this entire sorry affair is over, we'll handle the details.
Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me that we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details.
I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand.
Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will be a fight to remember!
Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lass. This will be a fight to remember!
Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please.
I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history.
The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity.
I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.

Intruder! Help!
Help! In here!
Backup! I need some help in here!
Over here! Hurry!
Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up.
Hold still...
You have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you.
Excellent work!
The General has sent me to obtain a powerful weapon for the war effort.
This was the last great bastion of the Dragon Cult, and their leader's mask was reported to be quite powerful.
You there! You look like a sympathetic soldier. I require your assistance!
Very good.
Let's see... found the Dragon Cult... laid siege... people already dead... poisoned themselves... blah, blah, blah...  ah! Here it is!
So the Dragon Cult poisoned their own well, which explains the ghosts. However, Skorm thought the well was the key to entering the inner areas.
That all happened in the First Era, so the well should be clear of poison by now. It says the key to the well is likely somewhere in the crypt.
I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.

Get him! Rip his throat out!
Give em the dogs, boys!
So you're the one who's been down there killing all my wolves. You're gonna die for that!
I own Iron-Breaker Mine. We make twice as much coin as those horkers over in Quicksilver Mine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I pay a good wage for any iron ore you dig up, if you're looking for work.
That would be Jarl Skald the Elder. He's over in the White Hall, probably talking about Ulfric like he's the second coming of Talos.
Jarl Brina Merilis is in charge, thanks to the Empire. Best hide any Talos amulets you have.
Skald supports Ulfric's rebellion, and he doesn't like having a couple of old Legionnaires living in his town.
He's a fool. A dragon has attacked Helgen. Dawnstar needs the Empire now more than ever.
Drowning your troubles in mead? A lot of folks are doing that these days. You'll want the Windpeak Inn.
As for work, you could try to catch Skald in a good mood, but your best bet would be working in the mines. They're on opposite ends of town.
My mother taught me. She was a Bard, from the college in Solitude.
I hear they accept most people who apply, if you're ever interested.
That would be Skald the Elder. He's been running Dawnstar ever since he was a boy, and he never lost that brat's attitude.
Turned on the Empire first chance he got. Now we're all part of this rebellion.
Brina Merilis came in with the whole damn Legion and deposed Skald. Couldn't have happened to a better man.
If you don't mind digging, I own the Quicksilver Mine. It's a better life than working in that damned Iron-Breaker Mine with all those milk drinkers.
It was supposed to be an honor, but very well.
Giants are a common problem in the Pale. The Empire always demanded I leave them be, but the Empire isn't here now.
Go and slay one of the beasts. It should let them know that Dawnstar is not to be trifled with.
I'm counting on you.
You don't have time? Fine.
You've shown those monsters that they will no longer be tolerated in the Pale. Good work.
Here, a reward from your Jarl.
If you've got an axe, you can always make gold chopping wood. Just bring me everything you cut.
That I am. My father left it to me after he died in that Great War against the Elves.
I don't care what's going on in the world. Rebellion. Dragons awakening. The mill is enough trouble for me to worry about.
How the tree came to grow there is a bit of a mystery...
Some say that when Vvardenfell erupted, a piece was blown to the middle of Skyrim and from the crater grew the tree.
I've also heard that it was a spore that fell from an island floating in the sky, but that just sounds like nonsense.
All I know is that the sap makes you feel as healthy as a cave troll, but slow as a drunk horker. And that and it fetches good coin.
Well met, hunter.
No? Well, then she hasn't gotten to you yet. But she will. And you don't you believe a word of it.
Oh she will, mark my words. And don't you let her.
The first sentence is delivered with mock enthusiasm. The second is almost an apology for the first.
Hm hmm.
We done?
Best if... you didn't mention to anyone that you saw me here.
I've said too much already.
Remember - don't trust the Imperials. No matter what honeyed lies they tell you.
Live long. Fight well.
You take care of yourself, now.
If you need any jewelry, just let me know.
If you need a drink, just holler.
Yeah, take care.
Come back anytime if you need a remedy.
Do forget to see me at my shop sometime - Arcadia's Cauldron.
Stay out of trouble.
Keep your nose clean.
Need anything else, just let me know.
I think I've got some mugs need scrubbin'.
Goodbye, dear.
Is it cold in here? I should put more wood on the fire...
Now please, no more questions.
If there's nothing else, I have work to do...
You should buy some produce from Carlotta's stall. Most of it comes from my farm.
You should stop by my farm if you get a chance. See what life's really about.
It's the leaving that's hardest, I know.
Some parting advice - women love sonnets.
Yeah, take care of yourself.
sleezy
Good doin' business with ya.
We'll have to have a pint together sometime, you and me.
Good hunting.
Remember, I've got the freshest meat in all of Whiterun.
Right. Till next time.
Sincere, polite, responsible
I was done talkin' anyway.
You go on your way now, boy.
You go on your way now, girl.
Farewell, my lady.
Farewell, sir.
You watch yourself out there.
Keep your eyes open for those Stormcloak dogs, yeah?
Do be careful, child. Skyrim is not as safe as it used to be.
By the way, you might want to stop in at Warmaiden's. These days, folk need all the protection they can get.
Long live the Empire.
The Stormcloaks are living on borrowed time, believe me.
May your sword be sharp, and your tongue sharper.
Keep a song in your heart, and a blade in your boot.
It's back to work, then.
I'll see you.
Yes, yes. Goodbye.
May all your possible futures be bright.

Thanks for the business.
I've really got to be going.
I think I hear my daughter calling...
Goodbye, ma'am.
Goodbye, sir.
May Talos guide you. Always.
Stay vigilant! Our enemies are legion!
Goodbye. And if you happen to see Mikael, tell him I was asking about him...
See you.
Right, then.
Hmm hmm.
Finally. I got stuff to do, ya know.
Back to my book...
Damn it, I lost my page...
The blessing of Arkay be upon you.
Walk always in the light, in these days of darkness.
Sure. Whatever.
laughs little to himself, like he's happy he made a joke
Now if ya don't mind, my house could do with a bit of dusting.
Grace of Kynareth be with you.
Travel great Skyrim, and Kynareth travels with you.
You need to be careful in this city. Never know who you can trust, these days.
Right, I really am busy. So...
If there's nothing else, I really do have important matters tend to.
If you run into my husband Nazeem, remind him that he's not married to himself.
Take care of yourself.
You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold...
Remember, your mind is the best weapon you have.
Stay sharp.
Don't forget to check inside the shop if you need anything.
Enjoy your visit to Dragonsreach.
If there's any more I can help you with, just let me know.
Next time, deal with Avenicci.
Now if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep.
Maybe we'll meet in the field. Just pray we're on the same side.
If you run into any Stormcloaks, kill a dozen for me.
I've got my eyes on you.
Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems.
Ride strong.
You always keep us in mind when you need a fresh horse, yeah?
Uh huh.
Back to work, I guess. There's never a shortage of dung to shovel around here.
Good. Chat time's over.
Yeah, whatever.
Please, leave me to recover my... mental energies.
Riften's biggest exports used to be fishing and honey, until the Black-Briar family moved in. Now the meadery is the biggest game in town.
The Thieves Guild has been pushing hard to regain a foothold in this city. Rumor has it they're falling apart from the inside.
The city guard has been tearing Riften apart looking for the source of our skooma problem. I'd hate to be in their shoes if they get discovered.
Sibbi Black-Briar is furious that his ex-lover tried to murder him. He's leaving no stone unturned searching for her.
Mjoll the Lioness used to adventure across Skyrim before she settled down in Riften. I hear it all ended when she lost her enchanted blade.
Crime is at an all-time high in this city thanks to the Thieves Guild. Don't we have enough problems with the war going on?
If Maven Black-Briar keeps raising prices on mead, I'll have to resort to watering it down just to make ends meet.
If it's true that the dragons have returned, what will it mean for all of us? Is this how it all ends?
They mean to take our history and crush it all in the name of some damn treaty.
pause before died... as if remembering a love on lost
I lost my own daughter to the Imperial dogs, and by Talos I'll not lose anyone else!
Talos is part of our culture. He's part of our heritage and our tradition. He's Skyrim personified.
To suddenly have all that wrenched away is like losing someone you hold dearly in your heart.
The Empire already took my daughter from us, but by Talos they will not take our homeland!
Lilija joined the Stormcloaks many years ago, when the first of the skirmishes broke out across Skyrim. I was so proud of her.
She served as a Battle Maiden, using her healing arts to help those that fell on the battlefield. Never even lifted a blade in her life.
It didn't matter. The Imperial soldiers cut her down... killed her like a dog and left her body to rot in the mud.
And that's why I won't rest easy until every single Imperial soldier joins her, and Ulfric sits upon the throne of Skyrim.
I trained our daughter Lilija as a healer... to one day tend the Shrine of Talos and replace me as a Priestess of Talos.
When the fighting began over the White-Gold Concordat, she ran off to join the Stormcloaks. She had her father's fire, how could I say no?
Last part is very hard to say
It was my sister, Lilija. She served as a Battle Maiden with the Stormcloaks.
We recently heard she'd been killed... I... I find it difficult to talk about. Perhaps you'd be better off speaking to my parents about it.
Anyway, I'm glad my work at the Black-Briar Meadery keeps me busy. Helps me keep my mind off of things.
My father was a Stormcloak soldier in his younger days. Now he just walks the streets spewing his hatred and propaganda.
My mother is the Priestess of Talos. She tends to the shrine and teaches his ways. I'm just not so sure she's delivering the right message.
Sorry, fresh out. Maybe next time.
Absolutely. Did you still want to buy one?
Nothing but the best. Black-Briar Mead... fresh from the vat.
Best of all, you don't have to pay the ridiculous prices Maven charges. So what do you say to that?
Here you go. Oh, and keep it quiet. This stuff isn't exactly easy to get a hold of at these prices, if you catch my drift.
Suit yourself. If you change your mind, I'll be around.
Sure. How do you think I get my hands on the good stuff and offer it so cheap? You think old Maven is just giving it away to anyone?
Good thing she makes so much money. Makes it easier for merchandise like this to fall through the cracks.
Take this with our gratitude.
I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say.
Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid.
The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known.
An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched.
No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later.
I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case.
Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out.  You see...
Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!
No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!
We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!
Crystal....  gone...
[coughing]

What brings you, wayfarer grim,   to wander here,in Sovngarde, souls-end,  Shor's gift to honored dead?
Beware! The World-Eater waits within the mist!
There is no escape. Courage is useless.
None may pass this perilous bridge 'til I judge them worthy by the warrior's test.

Yamarz has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave.
I must petition Malacath for relief. This curse must be lifted.
But I cannot travel to Malacath's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need.
I beg of you, can you bring me Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice.

Someone lied. Someone told the guard poor Cicero did something he did not. We were detained, delayed! The Night Mother kept from her new home!
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hmmm? No. No... Of course not. Because then Cicero would get angry, and that would be... ugly.
Now Loreius. Loreius has learned the meaning of ugly.
I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know... clean up the mess.
When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you.
You came to visit! It's so much better here with Grelod gone. Thanks to you.
I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery!
I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks?
But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.
Details, details. The Sanguine Rose breaks all the time and is fixed with but a thought.
In fact, here it is now. Think of it - a never-ending stream of minions. And all of the prestige of being Sanguine's chosen.

It seems like Dorthe grows a head taller every season.
Aye. She's helping me in the house, and even helps her father at the forge.
She'll make a fine wife someday.
Thank Shor I have a lot of years before I have to worry about that!
Thank you! Thank you! I'll never speak of this to anyone, I promise!
Well it's about damn time. Capturing a woman from her home, keeping her bound like an animal. Ridiculous...
Ah, you see? That wasn't so hard, now was it? Let's the two of us just forget we ever met, hmm?
He is our creator and master. The Daedric Lord of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse.
Malacath teaches us to honor all words with action. To demand blood from your enemies and strength from your allies.
He watches over all Orcs as his children. A truth those who leave the stronghold are quick to forget.
The Code of Malacath. It is both tradition and law in the strongholds. Break the code, and you must pay Blood Price.
The code is not written anywhere. It is known and carried on by the Orcs, and all who live in the strongholds follow it.
For an outlander, following it is simple. Do not steal or attack anyone in the stronghold, or be ready to pay in gold or blood.
It is said that an Orc first learns to wield a hammer in her mother's womb.
By tradition, a mother always teaches her children how to smith. If a chief has a second wife, she is called the [QUOTE]Forge-wife[QUOTE] in honor of this.
We have lived in Skyrim since before the Nords came. Our way is simple, all work to make the tribe strong.
Only the bravest are allowed to lead, and to marry. A great chief is able to attract many wives and raise bold children.
Wise women like myself are mothers of chieftains. We guide the tribe and advice our kin on what is most pleasing to Malacath.
I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.
You should try that bit on the barkeep. Maybe get yourself a free drink.
That amount should allow me to readily acquire a drink.
I'm ready when you are. Just give the word.
Aventus Aretino. He was sent to live here after his mother died. He escaped. And...
whispering
Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. He's really doing it!
Before he left, he said he was going to do the Black Sacrament. You know, to call the Dark Brotherhood. So they'd come and kill old Grelod!
Word out on the street is that he went home to Windhelm, and people have heard strange chanting coming from his house. Looks like he really did it!
A little boy who lived here. Aventus Aretino. He was nice, but really quiet, and sad, because his mother just died.
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he's trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. I really hope he does.
He ran away. Back home to Windhelm. Samuel told me he was trying to get some murderer people to come here and kill Grelod. Did he really do it?
Oh, Aventus Aretino. He was sent here when his mother died, but he ran away.
I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, and is trying to get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. That would be so wonderful.
I heard he went back to his house in Windhelm, to try and get the Dark Brotherhood to come and murder Grelod. And... he actually pulled it off!
Aventus Aretino? He only lived here for awhile. I think his mother got sick and died or something. Anyway, he's gone now. He ran away.
But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and is doing some kind of dark ritual. He's trying to summon some killers to come get old Grelod.
But Samuel told me he's back home in Windhelm, and did some kind of dark ritual. He summoned killers to murder old Grelod. He's saved us all.
And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you.
That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world.
Now, what do you all say?
Unemotionally. Forced to say [QUOTE]I love you[QUOTE] to someone you hate.
Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Grelod.
That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.
I'm lucky enough that none of my friends have been killed. Of course we have soldiers coming through all the time.
Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools.
Haven't heard from him in a long while.
Not much to it, really. We fish, and keep to ourselves. Try to keep from upsetting the Empire or the Stormcloaks, and so far the war's left us alone.
A bunch of lazy rabble trying to make a living. Can't get better workers in because everyone's afraid of the tomb up above the mine.
Dead dragons... it hasn't moved since Ysgramor and it's not going to start now. Superstitious milk drinkers.
So it seems the milk drinkers were right. That dragon was nearly the death of us.
All we can do now is rebuild.
We got the mill up and running before we found out that the big stand of trees on the hill was sacred.
Now we can't cut them, and can't afford to buy another mill somewhere else.
So we scrounge whatever we can from around the tundra.
A lifetime of study, you might say. The best comes from Riften, but I haven't been there in years.
Ever tried making your own? It's... not easy. Trust me.
Not at all. I consider it a blessing.
My family was convinced coming here was a death sentence, or worse. It took years of insisting that this is what I'm meant to do.
Mages in Cyrodiil are all about politics. The Synod and the College of Whispers are too busy guarding secrets to bother to teach.
Skyrim was not J'zargo's first choice, but Winterhold is removed from politics, dedicated to study. This is the place for J'zargo to become great.
So far, if only because no one is telling me how great I ought to be.
I just want to learn, I don't want to think about what's expected of me.
Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that.
For centuries, we have benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with the south.
In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully, knowing their northern border is guarded by the fiercest warriors in all Tamriel.
And here you go... your payment, just as I promised.
The way things have been going around here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch.
a bit disappointed
Magic is shunned by most. If it can't be swung over your head and used to crack skulls, most Nords want nothing to do with it.
Magic is seen as something for elves, and weaker races.
Well, look at the evidence. Nords generally don't trust magic, so it's not off to a good start.
Throw in the Oblivion Crisis, which was caused by magic-users, and the troubles now with the Aldmeri Dominion, who are elves and magic users.
And finally take the fact that the College is the only thing left standing after most of Winterhold was destroyed. It's all fairly damning.
Well, that depends on what you're looking for.
Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school.
Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all of Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school.
Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar on Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge.
If you can find him and focus his attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion magic.
And finally, there's Colette. She may be... difficult to get along with, she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic.
surprised, confused
Confound it all. I was quite sure I was invisible, or at least transparent.
But you can hear me, obviously. Something still isn't quite right. At least I'm making progress.
Oh my, that's quite a difficult question.
Never underestimate the ability to influence others. Whether they're friends or foes, they're almost all susceptible to Illusion spells.
They can turn the tide of a battle in a moment's notice.
There are also spells that help in avoiding conflict altogether. Invisibility is tricky to master, but exceptionally useful.
Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes.
Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss.
You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell.
Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire.
It's lies. All of it. I don't care what she told you, it's all lies.
Faralda. Don't act like she didn't say anything. I know her, I know what she's been up to.
Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.
Are those parts ready yet?
I can only hammer so fast, Gerdur.
They don't have to be perfect. Just send them over when they're ready.
Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...
No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed.
Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?
Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...
Ha! Then I'm right. I knew it. He's trying to have somebody killed!
Sad, frustrated sigh at the beginning.
Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage.
But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood.
Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city.

Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how.
I'll see you at Northwatch Keep, friend.
Please, get word to my mother.
Let's go, let's go!
Of course. I should've known. Avulstein was behind this, wasn't he?
Of course. I should've known. This was all Avulstein's idea, wasn't it? Where is he?
A wise decision, but I fear he may not be safe there anymore.
They'll go looking for me, and Whiterun will be the first place they search.
So he might still be in there?
I don't dare go back in now. I'll just have to hope that in the confusion he can slip out.
Avulstein... you stupid boy...
What is my freedom worth, if the price is my brother's life?
I cannot stay here, AND I can't stay in Whiterun; two seprate locations
Our best hope now is to fall in with the ranks of the Stormcloaks.
But would you do me a favor? Tell my mother to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll know what it means.
I thank you again, friend. You've given me my life back.
I don't dare return to Whiterun. But my mother... She'll need some consolation.
Tell her... tell her to suffer the winter's cold wind, for it bears aloft next summer's seeds. She'll understand.
Though shall mourn my brother, I thank you, friend. You've given me my life back.
Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath.

bitterly
You're the one who put out the fire in the Lighthouse, right?
That was good work. Deeja's in the hold of the ship. Go down two levels.
I know it's a bit strange. Not exactly a name to bring comfort to the sick and ailing who come to buy a poultice or salve.
But what you must understand about Falkreath is that our town is defined, for better or wrose, by the large and ancient cemetery here.
That's why the inn is called Dead Man's Drink, the farm is called Corpselight Farm, and so on. I suppose it's sort of a running joke.
Well, my family back in Hammerfell didn't approve of my interest in lethal poisons and death in general. So I left, and wandered north.
When I found this town, with its huge cemetery, I felt right at home. I opened the shop and I've never looked back. This is where I belong.
I was Dengier's personal guard for years. I risked my hide more than once to protect him.
Why would I do that? For money? Because I swore an oath? No, it was because he was a good man and a true friend.
A true Nord places loyalty and honor above all else.
His name's Bolund. He's the one who works the lumber mill down by the river.
If you meet him, don't expect much in the way o' conversation. He ain't one for talking, especially with folk he don't know.
I was once, but not any more. I was wounded in a skirmish up near Windhelm. This was years ago, mind you.
Now, maybe I don't pick up a blade in Ulfric's name no more, but I still hold with his ideals. Skyrim is Nord land, and we ought to rule it.
We don't need no help from the Empire on that count.
You think some Emperor sitting on a gilded throne in Cyrodiil is going to know what's best for Skyrim?
Indignant
I'm no man's fool. I know Ulfric Stormcloak's selfish and power-hungry, but he's the devil I know. Does that put it plain enough for you?
Angry, reprimanding tone
Aye, not so long ago. Some'll tell you I stepped down on account of my old age.
Truth is, I found out about all the Imperial spies crawling around Falkreath. A few well-placed bribes, and they bought themselves some friends.
Suddenly the nobles are calling for a new Jarl, and all the while their pockets are jingling with the sound of Imperial septims.
They named me Thane, and they got my nephew Siddgeir in my place. A real friend to Cyrodiil, that one.
Nervous
Taking care of the entire hold is another matter entirely. It would be a big enough job without the war on and the dragons about.
I just hope I can do right by the good folk who are looking to us to see to their needs.
Comes down to trust, I expect. After Dengeir gave up his seat to his nephew, he didn't trust anyone.
Everywhere he looks, he sees assassins, spies an' plots against him. I'm the only one he confides in.
So, when he was made Jarl again, he didn't wait a moment to name me his Steward. He said I was the only choice.
Master Arngeir, are you going to just let him continue to...
I have something to say first.
muttered under her breath
The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
We have no interest in negotiating with the Empire. It's only a matter of time before they are driven out of Skyrim.
There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim.
We're here to arrange a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more.
You should be glad enough of a chance to lick your wounds at this point in the war.
I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.
flatly - irritated
he thinks this is likely a big waste of time
We have nothing to say to each other. Paarthurnax's murder is beyond my powers of forgiveness.
Yes. But understand - during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be.
If not for Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he that first taught men to use the Thu'um.
I'd give a week's pay to see the look on Ulfric's face again, when he had to swallow the terms of the truce.
I hope this truce gives you what you need. It won't last.
As soon as I get back to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready.
When I return to Whiterun, I'll get my men ready to help trap this dragon.
The look on Tullius's face while the Greybeard read the terms was worth the trip.
I don't much like this truce. Feels like a betrayal to me.
We're counting on you to make this all worthwhile.
I sacrificed a lot here today for this plan of yours.
That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.
You'd better be able to deliver, Dragonborn. I sacrificed a lot here today.
Is everyone here? Let's get this started.
Don't worry, I'll come to this peace council of yours.
I never thought I'd ever willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.
It's good to be back in High Hrothgar after all these years.
I'd just as soon get this over with.
I'll come to your council. But I doubt any good will come of it.
When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?
I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time if you ask me.
I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.
Talking peace with Ulfric? You must be an optimist.
You've done well, to even get the two of them in the same room.
If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal.
We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.
impatiently
intensely
with a thin, cold smile
I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.
I'm here to ensure that General Tullius does not exceed his authority.
You gave Ulfric more than he deserved. This will certainly prolong the war.
These terms are satisfactory to my government. The truce is unlikely to last long in any case.
I'm here because it's required of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.
I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success.
I don't know why you gave Ulfric so much. That murderer will never rule Skyrim.
I'm glad you were able to negotiate a truce, but I don't trust Ulfric. He'll break his word as soon as it suits him.
We should get started.
You fight well, brother.
You fight well, sister.
Yergh!

Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim.
To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.
Not within society, no. Many who practice within the school of Conjuration do so on their own, secretly.
Falion is the only one I know who is public about what he does. He was once my teacher here, but left the College years ago.
He didn't like the Arch-Mage. Hated dealing with him, hated having to answer to him.
Falion said he hated what this place was becoming. So he just left. Aren found a note on his desk, and that was it.
I understand he settled down in Hjaalmarch, and his presence there caused something of a problem.
You are new, yes?
Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?
You... you have? Already?

I know you, Ulfric. You have no intention of coming to terms.
You're here to blacken the Empire's name, and I won't be party to it.
You may think this war is nearly won. You're wrong. I've been fighting you with a mere handful of troops.
Once the Emperor is convinced of the need, then you will see the full strength of the Imperial Legion.
If you think you can hold Riften, you're as deluded as you've always been.
We get Riften back. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your fine words.
I know how this works, Tullius. I've learned the value of Imperial promises the hard way. Never again.
You're losing this war and you know it.
If you think that winning a few battles means you're winning the war, you're even worse at strategy than diplomacy.

I expected better from you.
I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing.
I'm impressed at your even-handed treatment. Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.
What? Have you forgotten your oath to the Emperor?
Come see me in Windhelm when this is all done. There's always work for those willing to fight for Skyrim.
I'm sure that will be a great comfort to the families of your comrades who died to free the land you just gave back to the Empire.
You should think harder on your commitment to Skyrim's freedom next time you're deciding what's right.
You made your decision. Now live with it.
Very honorable, I'm sure, but you should not put your own honor above the freedom of Skyrim.
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a son of Skyrim.
You've disgraced yourself and our cause. You are no longer fit to be known as a daughter of Skyrim.
Ulfric showed his true colors today, eh? Don't worry. You aren't the first to be taken in by his self-serving lies.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought you'd finally seen through Ulfric's lies.
Excellent! You aren't the first to have a change of heart, after seeing what Ulfric's reckless pride is doing to Skyrim.
Come see me in Solitude when this is all done. The Emperor can always use another good soldier.
Now, back to the matter at hand.
I suppose that's the fairest deal we're likely to get.
If we're not going to get Riften, we need you to give us something.
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Markarth on these terms.
You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it Colovian brandy. These terms are still not acceptable.
Come on, Ulfric. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.

Why would I give you that, if I wouldn't give you Riften?
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn decide the fairness of my request.
I guess I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry to see you go. You fought well for us.
Don't listen to him. Ulfric's been telling lies about himself for so long, he's actually starting to believe them.
Jarl Baalgruf, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?
Well that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, have you?
Come on Galmar. We have a lot of work to do.
This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And General Tullius. Riften is ours!
Giving up Markarth is a heavy price for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.
I admit, I really didn't expect you'd be able to arrange a truce. Getting Ulfric to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.
Yes, I'm ready to do my part.
Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap.
Your man Horik is wearing his old Legion armor. What should I make of that?
He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty. And we're loyal to Dawnstar.
At last, the treasure is mine! All mine!

Hmm. These doors seem to be the only thing left between me and the treasure.

Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team- said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.
Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?
Well, at least this post is safe enough. Come on, let's get back to work.
Deadly serious
Sir, are you serious?
...As you say, sir.
What do you think this is?
Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous... three of the guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week.
Shocked, terrified
Commander yelling orders
Oh thank you, kind stranger. Thank you for helping Cicero and his poor, stranded mother.
He he. That'll teach the little loony.
A jester. In these parts. Man must be completely off his tree.
Move along, now.
Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law!
Says it softly. Simmering in anger.

Our terms are simple.
Riften must be returned to Imperial control. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
with fatherly condescension
Do you really think Ulfric will just turn Riften over because some Imperial general barked an order?
I'm sure General Tullius does not expect something for nothing.
Of course not! What will you offer for Riften, Tullius? Some empty promises? Maybe some more Imperial bluster?
Come on, Tullius, you can't seriously expect us to just hand over Riften at the negotiating table.
You haven't been able to take it back yet. Why should we give it up now?
Jarl Ulfric, what would you want in return?
First, let me be clear. The sons of Skyrim know from bitter experience that talking to the Empire is a waste of time, or worse.
Imperial promises are simply a way to lull you while they prepare a dagger for your back.
But I accepted the Dragonborn's invitation to this council, and I at least will negotiate in good faith.
a bit gloating
Riften is off the table. The Empire barely has a toehold left in Skyrim. We don't need to pay such a high price for this truce.
skeptical that Tullius is actually serious
Have you killed them all yet?
Well, hurry up.
Then we've no time to lose. Follow me!
So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace.
Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting.
They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? [QUOTE]Season unending[QUOTE]... so it has proved.
Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this... violation of all our traditions.
But regrets are pointless. Here we are.
Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.
We consider even sitting down to talk with these rebels more than generous.
We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.
Galmar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
Vignar. We will do whatever I decide is in the best interests of Skyrim. Are we clear?
evenly
pleased that you agree with him
You're right. Tullius isn't in any position to ask for Riften.
relieved that you sided with him after all
surprised you sided with him, despite being loyal to Ulfric
You can't just leave me here!
Fie. We beseech you. Darken this gem so that we may use its power to restore The Order of the Black Worm.
Grant us this power so that in your name we may vanquish our enemies.
Yeah, fie!
The Order shall rise.
So. Arngeir, is it? You know why we're here. Are you going to let us in or not?
You were not invited here. You are not welcome here.
We have as much right to be at this council as all of you. More, actually, since we were the ones that put the Dragonborn on this path.
I know what path you set her on. And now Paarthurnax's wisdom is lost to us, just when we need it most.

with a grim smile
If it were up to you, the Dragonborn would sit dreaming on this mountain doing nothing!
Delphine, we're not here to rehearse old grudges.
Damn right we do.
Don't play dumb, Tullius!
Tell him, Ulfric.
I just want to make clear that the only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace.
We have no need to negotiate when the rebels are so clearly losing the war.
I have no authority to negotiate a permanent settlement, unless Ulfric is ready to sue for peace and turn himself over to Imperial justice.
Enough posturing, Tullius. If you came to talk, let's get on with it.
One moment.
What is there to know? It's in the temple, you bring it out. You bring it to me, I pay you. Now get moving.
You're... probably right. Just hurry, please. Who knows what those things are doing to her.
Thank you, friend.
Father!
Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?
Of course not. My spirit remains strong.
My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?
I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.
emphasize [QUOTE]our[QUOTE]
This man is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
This woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?
Please, lead on.
Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal.
She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.
If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.
You should know. You got the map for me from Bleak Falls Barrow.
I should say so. I'd be careful in the future before you confront someone without all of the facts!
Frightened, almost crying.
Then I found that wretched poetry from Svana. When I confronted Sibbi about it, he threatened to kill me.
I was scared so I told my brother Wulfur. He went to talk to Sibbi for me and... and... Sibbi killed him. My brother wasn't even armed!
Frightened, crying.
It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?
Results speak volumes over words and you've just proved it.
Did you happen to discover where the fetcher was getting his skooma from?
Then there's no time to lose. It won't take long for Sarthis's associates to learn of his death.
Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in Riften.
Then I want you to head out there immediately and eliminate all of them.
I can't afford to have another Sarthis blunder into Riften because they think we're too lazy to disrupt their pitiful operation.
Good. Report back to me when your task is complete.
Good. Make sure not one of them escapes alive.
I can't say I'm happy with your decision. If you change your mind, let me know.
I'm very disappointed. I'd advise you to rethink that decision soon.
Look, I don't think I should say. I mean, they could kill me!
It's not worth dying over.
It's got nothing to do with the coin... this is my life we're talking about.
You can't threaten me any worse than they have!
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
I get my skooma from Sarthis Idren. He has some sort of a setup over at the Riften Warehouse.
You can't get inside though. They've kept that place locked up tight since the war began.
If it wasn't for skooma, I'd already be on my way out of this horrible city.
All my gold... completely gone. Now I have to start over. I'll never use skooma again!
Although I suppose a little mead now and then would be harmless...
I overheard Bolli say that only the Jarl carries the key to the warehouse.
When I meet Sarthis there, he's usually waiting for me outside with his bodyguard.
Yes, I'm afraid we're aware of Sarthis's presence in the warehouse.
Unfortunately, we're certain he has informants within the city guard. Every time we've made a move to arrest him, he's escaped.
Say a bit quieter as if the walls have ears
Ah yes, Sarthis... a thorn in my side for the last few years.
I've tried repeatedly to eradicate that meddler, but he has ears within the city guard. Gives us the slip every time we raid the warehouse.
Excellent. Here, this is the key to the warehouse.
See if you can drop in on this dealer of poison and convince him to close down his operation permanently.
Good. Here, take the key to the warehouse.
Pay dear old Sarthis a visit and tell him Maven sends her regards, would you?
Hm. Well, if you change your mind, come see me again.
Let me give you a word of advice.
Think about your choices carefully from now on. You'll go much farther in Riften with me on your side.
Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored.
speaking to someone else... you're very sick, hard to talk
It will be my pleasure.
protest/fear... about to be imprisoned
furious
Farewell, Sabjorn.
Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.
Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead.
Hold on, my boy. Hold on!
Hold on, my dear. Hold on!
I thought it high time I caught up with you.
I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just look at all these coffins!
This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this.
You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful.
Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
Gods, it's cold. They'd better find something good in there to make this worthwhile.
As long as the College keeps paying, I'll keep digging.
For thousand-year old ruins, they're not much to look at.
Can't imagine what the College expects to find in here.
This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely.
Ohh... but I will have your blood...
Oh, I can smell your blood...
You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead...
Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back.
Can't wait to count out your coin...
You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...
Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!
Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!
Come. Come and face the Forsworn...
First you... then all of the Reach!
The Forsworn will reclaim what is rightfully ours!
Soon you will know the cold of death...

Eternal slumber awaits...

Earned quite a name for myself when I was younger. The Bards College still teaches some of my work to their students.
It's a school that teaches music, poetry, that sort of thing. Most bards in Skyrim have been to the college at some point.
If you're thinking of applying, talk to Viarmo in Solitude.
Affectionately, you're proud of his importance to the war effort.
My husband. He was the blacksmith up at Castle Dour.

Be sure and investigate Radiant Raiment's fine selection of clothing. We have many items you'll fancy, I'm sure.
I suppose I would, but you're the only one who gets that greeting.
It's never been an issue. People say you helped with the problems at Wolfskull Cave.
I applaud anyone who assists the court.

There are no heroes in this war. No winners to be had and no real conclusion.
There are no heroes in this war. Even with Ulfric here in Solitude, there are no winners to be had. No real conclusion.
They're... adequate. Honestly, I rely on the business brought in by the Burning of King Olaf, and that's not likely to happen this year.
Oh, very brisk. When the snow sets in, even the hardiest Nord needs some spiced wine to warm the blood.
I have my ways, but it's not easy these days.
The Blackblood Marauders have been plundering ships off the coast. A lot of people been hurt by their foolishness.
It's been easier lately.
The Blackblood Marauders haven't been seen since the Icerunner attack, so my shipments have been more regular.
No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title.
Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line.
It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.
Not yet, no. Although it is true my husband Torygg was the High King, and I am his widow... now is not the time to lay claim to such a title.
This land is riven by war, and her people suffer for it. The Stormcloaks are a blight on Skyrim, and like any blight... must be purged.
Only then will I take my rightful place as High Queen.
I was a member of the court during the reign of Torygg's father. It was Torygg who appointed me to the position.
Please. You're in the presence of a born huntsman. I can hear the sweat sliding down your forehead.

But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop.
Yes. My older brother. He was a bit of a fop, really.
And truth be told, since Torygg's death, he had no real power in court. But still... He didn't deserve to die.
I make sure Erikur keeps breathing.
I provide my wisdom and insight to the court.
It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise...
That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time.
Aye, but I'll be here in Solitude for longer still. Fihada's skill as a fletcher drew me to this place. I wanted to learn.
And there is still much of Skyrim I wish to see. I hear there is a city, Wind-Helm, that is nearly white with... What do you call it? Ah yes! Snow.
And far to the west lies a ruin. Volskygge. Inside, there is said to be a wall, black as night. And it speaks! In the ancient Dragon tongue!
There are wonders in this place I never dreamed imaginable.

I was there. I fought in the Great War. I was on the field at Anvil. And when I was struck down, they left me.
You understand? They left me for dead. I didn't leave them.
I shouldn't be. Mama says if I do, people are going to ask about uncle Roggvir.
Maybe if I don't talk, they won't either.

Perhaps, but necessary. As you know my cousin, Fura, died out there fighting for us. She wouldn't have had to, if it weren't for Roggvir.

It's true the Vignar Gray-Mane and his lot are one of Whiterun's oldest and, depending on who you ask, most respected clans. I don't dispute that.
But it's one thing to take pride in your lineage, and another to cling blindly to the past. What they call honor and tradition, I call ignorance.
Money, you laggard! What else? It always comes down to coin.
The Gray-Manes have deep roots in Whiterun, but so do we. Difference is, we're rich, and Vignar hates it.

We've got the same pride, the same honor, and we've got wealth. No wonder they envy us.
Peryite, heed our call if you deem us worthy. Our leader, Orchendor, has led us here and for that we are thankful.
He has shown us that our suffering is not a punishment, but a blessing.
Yes, a blessing. For many months we have sought your guidance, yet we have heard nothing from you.
If we do not please you, give us a sign so that we may understand why.
Yes, a sign. We are lost without your guidance.
On the ninth of Rain's Hand our prayers went unanswered, yet here we stand, not faltering in our belief that soon you will show yourself to us.
Yes, show yourself to us. Until that day, we will continue to devote our lives to you and suffer for you.
Yes, suffer for you.
Keep your eyes and ears open my Brothers and Sisters.  Orchendor needs us to keep vigilant while he convenes with Peryite in the Arcanex.
I'm sorry to wake you, my Brother. I have a request from Orchendor.
Yes, what is it?
He requests more barrels of ichor to be delivered to the Arcanex tomorrow.
This is the reason you wake me? I already have Orchendor's request taken care of.
I'm sorry my Brother.
Now leave me to my sleep. My strength and patience are waning.
Yes, my Brother. Forgive me. May the blessing of Peryite be with you.
Yes, yes, as with you. Now be off.
Are you asleep?
I know you can't hear me, brother. I don't like what we've become.
We've been here so long and what do we have to show for it?
Orchendor promised a place where we would be accepted and taken care of.
He promised Peryite would be present at all times and give us comfort in our suffering.
Forgive me for saying this, brother, but I have not felt Peryite's presence.
I want out. I want to leave this place. I long for the fresh air of the Reach. This place only makes us sicker.
But who am I kidding, I know you wouldn't let me leave, brother. You truly believe in Orchendor and his promises.
I know this place will eventually kill us. I have come to accept that. But I will always regret that day I introduced you to Orchendor.
Ah ha! So you're a student of theoretical applied harmonics!
Putting aside Ralston's Constant of Universal Inversion for a moment, how would you approach the problem?
Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent or allow it to generate its own field?
Seven. Astonishing. I hadn't considered that.
I mean, it would take months... years to work out the differentials. But what a revolutionary concept.
Wait, wait. I can see a minor problem in your theory. Without a soul siphon, how would you prevent permanent magicka burn?
The blue thing? But even the simplest harmonic field is composed of entirely...
Wait just a moment. The blue thing. Yes, yes, yes! I can see your point. Draw out the necessary energies using a Jarol Apparatus!
But wait. What about soul reversal? You must be aware of the consequences when using the apparatus near an open magic field.
Calipers? That's utterly ridiculous. Maybe long ago, you could just find calipers in every household across Tamriel, but not anymore.
Hold on, you've given me a brilliant idea. Just as calipers hold materials in place, a soul siphon can hold magic fields in place.
Genius! And I'm sure you've completely worked out how to counteract complete dimensional collapse, right?
Of course! Nine is the most basic of magical principles. Oh, how stupid of me.
That completely takes care of all your basic problems, magicka burn, dimensional collapse and thermic drift!
You've done it! Now, if I can only remember what we were originally talking about.
Are you completely insane? Swallow a soul gem?
That has to be the most brilliant and unexpected solution I've heard in a long time. It solves all of my problems and keeps the field stable!
Now all I need... wait, what were we talking about?
It was Aerin who found me dying outside of a Dwemer ruin. If he hadn't brought me here and nursed me back to health, I would have died.
When my strength returned and he told me about the problems plaguing Riften, I decided fate brought me here for a reason... so I stayed.
You know, I'm beginning to respect you. Other than Aerin, you seem to be the only other person I've met I might be able to trust.
Since we share the same opinion of them, let me warn you that they're recruiting others to join their [QUOTE]guild[QUOTE] and you should be cautious.
That's a shame. Too many people in Riften share your view and look where its getting them.
It's going to take more than just myself and Aerin to help this city... it has to want to help itself first.
You disappoint me. I expected someone from outside Riften to be different, but I see corruption's reach holds little regard for boundaries.
Enjoy the city. It will suit you well.

Hopefully small things that fit inside pockets, and will not be noticed if they are missing.
Because Tolfdir says so. He says there are things to learn here.
Hopefully we can learn something from the experience. How the ancient Nords used magic, maybe even what happened to this place.
Not really. Just that it's very, very old. It was one of the first cities of men in Tamriel, I think.

You can try, but I'd keep your sword-arm ready if things get ugly.

Ainethach needs to get rid of those Silver-Blood. Then maybe we can go back to work.
You should talk to Ainethach. He runs the mines. Used to anyway.
You should talk to Ainethach if you have business with the mine. Not that there's much these days.
Forsworn attacks are bad enough, but those sellswords are worse.
Do that and I'll make sure you get a cut.
Right.
You're right. They always get what they want, somehow. Fine. Tell Atar I'll sell.
Someone has to stand up to them. I won't sell.
That's more gold than they're offering. Fine. I'll sell.
This isn't about the money.
Easy. I'll sell. Just don't hurt anyone.
Let's do that.
Dealing with a mob wouldn't be good for my coin purse. Fine. We're leaving.
Let's see them make us.
That I will, stranger. This is more than the Silver-Bloods are paying us. We'll clear out.
Don't think I'm being paid already? Get lost.
Whoa. Wait a second. I was just kidding. We'll leave. We'll leave!
I thought today was going to be boring.
Good work. Here's your cut. I guess this finishes up our contract with the Silver-Bloods, so we'll be heading out.
My family has owned Karthwasten for generations. Rare for anyone in the Reach that isn't a Nord.
Not that it does me any good. Nords think I'm working for the Forsworn. Forsworn think I'm working for the Nords.
I'm not from here. I'm a sellsword. These are my men.
Something's happening to bring the dragons back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
The Thalmor happened. They've been hunting down every Blade they can find for the past thirty years.
Thanks to the White-Gold Concordat, they've been able to operate throughout the Empire with impunity.
Part of the cost of peace. Emperor Titus Mede saved his Empire at a very high price. A price that included the Blades.
The Nords didn't like the peace treaty much either. Thirty years later, the Empire ends up with the Stormcloak rebellion on its hands.
No doubt exactly as the Thalmor intended.
The Blades have always guarded and guided the Dragonborn. But we'd forgotten why.
Now our purpose is clear. I'm all that's left of the Blades, and you're the Dragonborn.
Together we're going to stop these dragons, if we have to put every last one of them back in the ground.
Dragons are coming back, and you're a born dragonslayer. That's all you need to know right now.
Is there someone out there?
You have to help me, they are going to kill me!
We offer this soul to The Revenant: he who watches over the opponents of Arkay and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers!
There's no chance anyone in authority approved this.
Our ancestors should be allowed to rest in peace.
Why? Because it's old, and full of dead things?
Clearly you've never spent any time in Morrowind.
Did he now?
Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?
Is that the one about something buried beneath Saarthal? Something that men and mer fought over?
I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.
Ah, yes. Well, I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later.
I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever this is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before.
If you'd allow me to indulge myself for a moment, I thought I might make a few observations...
This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before.
This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion.
There's a fine line between respect and boot-licking, new blood. But I like your spirit.
We've decided this will be your Trial. Do well, and you'll be counted among the Companions.

Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?
Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done.

Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery.
mildly surprised
You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk.
Here, this should help.
You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.
absolutely furious
Now I have to spend a fortune to keep the whole thing quiet. Guess where that money comes from.
This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that could identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.
Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me.
You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately.

Look out! The wolf is loose!
You think it'll work?
'Course not. Dogs I could train. But a half-starved wolf? Not a chance.
Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.
So, you in?
...Yeah. We can't have that rheumy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them.
We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready.
Good luck out there.

Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb.
If the owner cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the picture... which she can't afford.
If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.
Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support.
This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.
Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.
Does Dravynea know?
She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.
Sweltering in here.
I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad.
How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?
I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.
Again with the mead!
You going to be at the inn tonight?
Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.
What's your wife think of your trips?
They're none of her business, and none of yours either.
What did I tell you about snooping around my wards?
Woman, there's a vein of malachite as thick as my leg back there.
And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off.
So go dig at the other corner for a bit.
Well... just get it done.
Roggi tell you about the scorcher we found under the scaffolding?
Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there.
Well I nearly lost my eyebrows to it.
All right, I'll take a look at it.
Is the new shaft cleared yet?
No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you.
You're busy. I'll come back later.
Kjeld bothering you again?
Nothing I can't handle.
Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line.
How's the mine today?
Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.
As usual. I've always got an eye on the rocks.
Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there?
That can't be a coincidence.
The Arch-Mage.

Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?
Do you seek to finish that which you could not?
You only face failure once more...
You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?
Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?
Come. Face your end.
So you're interested in my potions and ingredients?
Got a pretty full stock of potions and alchemy reagents.
Ah, so you're an alchemist, then?
The finest weapons and armor.
Hmm... Blades, helmets. Pretty much anything to suit your needs.
Looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage?
Usual guild rate. Let's take a look at them.
Why don't you take a look at some of my merchandise and we'll see what kind of a deal we can make.
I've got coin and I've got merchandise. Let's see what we can do.
I give special rates to members of the Thieves Guild. Show me what you've got.
Bow and arrows for the mighty huntsman.
An archer, eh? Oh, I've got just what you need.
What are you hunting? Never mind. I don't want to know.
Drink for the thirsty, food for the hungry.
Let's sate that appetite, hmm?
Depends. Are you thirsty, hungry, both?
Beautiful things for beautiful people.
Let see what adornments I might have available...
I've got some wonderful jewelry.
Oh, a bit of this and a bit of that.
Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing.
Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures.
Just what you see here.
Everything I've got on display, really.
See for yourself.
Spells and incantations for those with the talent to cast them.
So, you wish to master the arcane arts...
Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...
Clothes and raiment for the discerning customer.
Breeches, gowns... clothes for any occasion, really.
Let's see if we can't find an outfit that suits you.
Take a look.

The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.
Old fort. Abandoned for years. They're like jackals, making their home anywhere they can find.
You there. We are looking for someone in Whiterun, and will pay good money for information.
So, what book should I read to you tonight?
How about [QUOTE]The Lusty Argonian Maid[QUOTE]?
Mother!
You've got no sense of humor, you know that? Why don't you pick up where you left off with [QUOTE]The Real Barenziah.[QUOTE]
Lars, dear, why don't you go outside and play? It's a beautiful day.
That's all right, grandmother. I like staying home with you.
It's that Braith girl again, isn't it? Has she been bothering you again? I've a mind to speak with her mother.
No! Please, grandmother, don't do that. I'm fine. Really. Can we just... not talk about this anymore?

When will you be makin' some more jewelry, love? Some silver lockets and amulets would fetch a nice price at the stand.

said with air of superiority
We were excavating this old tomb when we opened a chamber full of corpses. The team took one look, turned tail, and ran.
Well, probably not like these. The ones in there are all still walking around.
As if annoyed by a trivial manner
Say, that's not a bad idea. You look like you could handle yourself against these beasts.
I'll tell you what. You help me get the treasure and I'll split it with you. Deal?
Legend says this tomb holds a treasure that bestows great power on the one who discovers it. Beyond that, not much more is known.
Obviously, this treasure will fetch a good deal of gold, and I'm willing to let you share in the reward when we find it.
Excellent. With my brains and your brawn, that treasure will soon be mine... uh, ours.
Bah! You're just as bad as the rest of them.
Bear in mind, even if you clear out the tomb, you'll still need a key to get to the treasure. A key I happen to possess.
First, I need you to clear the main chamber of those monstrosities. I'll stay here until you're finished, planning our next move.
You shoe that gelding, boy?
Yes, father.
Groom her, too?
You know I did.
You clean out that muck?
Yes, father, I did. And I watered her, and got fresh feed, and refitted the old saddle, just like you asked. Is there anything else?
Don't suppose there is. But you don't have to be so damned prickly.
I tell you? Saw that wild mare again yesterday, just outside the walls.
Yeah. So?
So? So?
Shor's beard, boy! You forget where you're standing? What kind o' business we're running?
We manage to break that mare and bring her back here, we can sell her for a small fortune.
Oh. Okay. So we should try to... what? Capture it?
Yes, son. We should try to capture it.
Listen, father. I've been thinking....
Here it comes again. Not happy with a roof and a trade, no. You want to be something entirely... different.
I'm just no good at this. You said it yourself. Gods, I don't even like horses. And if it's true what they're saying about dragons...
Dragons? You want to go out and fight dragons? Are you completely off your nut?
Come on, father, how hard can it be? They're just... big lizards. And those scales and teeth, they must be worth a fortune...
Big lizards? By Shor, your mother gave birth to a half-wit. That is the end of this discussion.
Hello, Fralia dear.
Lillith - always a pleasure. Just browsing, or were you looking for something particular?
Funny you should ask. I'm in the market for a new locket. Something in polished silver, maybe. Big enough to hold, say, a folded-up letter?
Ahhh, I see. I think I know just what you need. I don't have anything like that here now, but my Eorlund - he can make you one right quick.
When I get home, I'll have him start on it right away. Come back to pick it up in, oh... three days?
Perfect, my dear. Absolutely perfect. I'll see you then.
Do you have anything even remotely fresh?
I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day.
Hmm. As you say.
Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?
You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?
Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices. Just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?
I'm not [QUOTE]afraid[QUOTE] of anything. I simply prefer quality merchandise. No, no this meat won't do at all. Too much fat, and it all smells... wrong.
Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt.
voice dripping with venom - mad because he's been insulted
Can you close up the stand early today, mama?
I'm afraid not, little fairy. The fruit has about another day left before it spoils. We've got to sell as much as we can, as soon as we can.
That's what you always say.
a mother laughing gently at her daughter
Can we at least go to the tavern for supper?

And what might you be looking at?
Oh, the fruit looks so good. So juicy.
No handouts today, Brenuin. Now scat. You'll scare off my paying customers.
Oh, just one apple, Carlotta? Just one tiny apple. I'll pay you tomorrow, I swear it.
That's what you said last week, and the week before that. Now go, before I call a guard.
No, no! Don't do that. No need to do that. I'm going. See? I'm leaving. No guards, please.
sighs at the beginning
You've got the heart of Mara herself, you know that? Thank you, Carlotta. Thank you.
Everyone is this city is so on edge. I could use some good news, Skulvar.
Ha! Four more geldings sold. Sound like good news to you?
I do hate to admit it, but if nothing else, all the fighting lately has been a complete blessing to this business.
Aye, that it has. Trust me, mum - once you've killed a man from a horse, you'll never want to fight on the ground again. Ain't no goin' back.
Why thank you for that most colorful assessment, Skulvar.
So we'll be needing fresh horses, then?
Aye, mum. That we will. Mares, stallions, donkeys - I don't think it matters. Pretty sure I can sell any steeds we get.
Excellent. I'll send the proper letters, then, and have some fresh horses delivered straightaway.
Lookin' forward to it.
I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of Whiterun hold.
Again? You just had an [QUOTE]extended hunt[QUOTE] last month. To the Pine Forest, wasn't it.
That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.
Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!
Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.
Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and [QUOTE]commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old[QUOTE] and blah blah.
Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord.
At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.
Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.
All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.
Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that Riverwood shipment.
It's been two months, and no word from father.
Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter.
Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in.
If it'll put your mind at ease, then I agree. But not now, all right? We need the business from the stand.
Oh look, it's little baby Battle-Born.
Leave me alone, Braith...
What are you gonna do if I don't? Huh? Gonna cry to your papa?
Just go away!
You'd better give me five septims, right now, or I'm going to bloody your nose...

So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?
No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet.
Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth.
You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?

I want to see you when you're done working.
I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something.
I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something.
That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.
Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no.
But tomorrow. Definitely.
Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no.
Fancy a game of Iron Hearts later?
You going to lose horribly, and then say you let me win?
Probably.
You ain't made me that stew in a long time.
Which, the mutton or the vegetable?
Mutton.
Hmm. So I haven't. All right, I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow and we can have it for dinner.

That's just you getting skinnier every day, old man. You're losing your padding. You need to eat more.

Listen, Braith... Why don't you talk to your mother about this, okay? There's a good girl.
I wish your mother were still alive. She could answer you much better. Let me think on it and we'll talk later.
Mother?
I wanted to ask you something. It's about a boy...
Mother? Can I talk to you?
Not now, Braith.
But...

Papa, the next time you go away, I want to come with you.
When I go away, I go to war. That's no place for a little girl.
Every knight needs a squire. I could help you with your sword, things like that.
Nice try, blossom, but I'm not a knight, I'm a mercenary. The answer's still no. Besides, your mother would miss you too much.
Yeah. Right.
He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out.
If only this parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol. Any idea what that might be?
Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and speak to Mercer.
But for now, you're off to speak to Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name.
I'll give you one good reason. Maven Black-Briar.
Burn all the hives and she'd have to import honey for Black-Briar Meadery which would cut into her profits.
Fine. Take it!
Once the new owner finds out I gave in, I'm as good as dead anyway.
Keep your eyes open, they'll try to hit us again... I just know it.
If they do, we'll send them crying back to their boss again.
I can't believe how lucky we got landing this job. It's a far cry from working for the Stormcloaks.
You're telling me. Playing nursemaid to a bunch of bees and drinking mead all day beats dying on some battlefield.
So why did he sell this place? I mean look at it. This is how to live.
No idea. Maybe he got tired of getting stung by these damn bees.
Agh... so bored! Only one fight in the last few weeks? This is gonna' drive me crazy.
Aringoth said as soon as the deed goes through, we're done here. Then we'll head south and look for more work. Deal?
Did you get a look at that thief that they sent to break into the place? What I wouldn't give for a night with her.
Sure. Then you wake up in the morning with your purse empty and your gear stolen. No thanks.
Have you seen Refnir? I told him to check out the well drain, but he never reported back.
Probably got drunk and fell into the lake. Who cares.
You are exactly what I was looking for.
My brother told me you were coming. I'm supposed to give you what you've earned.
You're the one Mazzaka described to me.
I'm Captain Aldis. I'm here to help you take down these bandits.
We're stretched thin in Solitude, and I don't expect these bandits to be much challenge. Are you ready?
With pleasure.
First you murder my sister, then you massacre my men!
You've betrayed me, murdered my sister and massacred my men!
It's appreciated. The captains around here will have one less thing to worry about. Here's your reward.
Good riddance.
I'll take care of it.
I've been away from Solitude for as long as I can. But if you decide to finish these bandits off, you'll be rewarded for your efforts.
Really?
Well, I do recall warning them it might not be the safest of locations. I hope this doesn't become a problem for us.
Were you able to learn anything?
Hmm. I can't say I've any idea what they were up to. Have you found this observatory?
You might be able to learn something from it. Keep looking, but be careful.
I can't imagine what that might be, but if it's safe, you might see if they were successful.
You could get some useful information about whatever they were up to. Sounds like it won't be of use to them now, anyway.
What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?
It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything!
If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted.
And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time.
And just why would you be doing that?
Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost.
It's all been for nothing.
So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer.
It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. [QUOTE]No, it won't be too cold[QUOTE] he said.
Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it!
Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.
I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know.

Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I can offer you something better... companionship.
I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered.
My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness.
But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever wish to journey with me, I'll be here.
There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar.
If anyone should be thanked, it should be you.

Well, like I told Delvin, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process.
Exactly. One of the pieces stolen from her was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back.
The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking.
It pains me to see this locket... to be reminded of  Fjotli once more, but I'm glad it's back where it belongs.
Tell Delvin that if he still desires to have my support for the Thieves Guild in Windhelm, he's got it.
I'm still amazed that your plan worked.
You'll be the toast of Whiterun for this!
No one can doubt that you truly are Dragonborn.
You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.
I can't believe that worked!
Something to tell the grandkids, eh?
I can't believe I'm still alive.
He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead.
If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!
Very true! Hmm. I wonder... do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?
Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon - hence its name.
Well, you see, the palace - Dragonsreach - was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name.
Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akaviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons.
Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.
Yes, yes. We must think. He must have some means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be.
The Jarl's palace in Whiterun? Ah, yes... the old story about King Olaf's pet dragon. Ingenious!
G...Gavros? Is that you?
I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...
What the...
Who are you? Where's Gavros?
You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay.
A close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us.
Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.
Hold a moment. This is more than a simple prison break. I want to have Arn's name stricken from the record books permanently.
I'm setting him up with a new identity. It's the only way to throw the guard permanently off his trail.
The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn.
The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine?
Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him.
If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional.
You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.
One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid.
I have eyes within Dragonsreach. They tell me that all correspondence from other holds are sent to the Jarl's private chambers.
It's a well-known fact that the steward keeps all of the records on Whiterun's prisoners in a large book.
My sources tell me you can find that book in a study in his quarters.
Change Arn's entry in the book to anything you want and they'll be forced to let him go after he serves a few weeks.
snicker at end - coy
I guess that means you're finished. Here's your payment.
Tell Delvin that he has my support and all the weight it carries in Whiterun from now on. I think he'll be quite pleased.
It's about time you got here.
I'm not accustomed to dealing with people who are unreliable. That's why I asked Delvin to send me his best.
Hmph. That remains to be seen.
That's more like it.
Nothing raises my ire more than having an agreement broken. It's bad for business and it wastes time.
Captain Volf of the Dainty Sload has decided to test my patience on this matter by neglecting to honor a trade agreement we had established.
I need you to help me show him the error of his ways by sneaking on board the Sload and planting some contraband.
You'll need to get your hands on some Balmora Blue from Sabine Nyette down by the docks. She's the first mate on another ship, the Red Wave.
Once you get your hands on it, I want you to plant it in Captain Volf's footlocker. I'll take care of the rest.
Captain Volf is ashore right now and I want the authorities waiting for him when he gets back.
Now get going... I don't want to see your face until the job's done.
Yes, I know. In fact, by now, Captain Volf should be on his way to the prisons.
Our contract is complete. Here's a token of my gratitude for your efforts.
Oh, convey my compliments to Delvin for me. Tell him I'll be happy to reopen whatever doors he needs in Solitude.
Get back! Get back! We need to trap it, not kill it!
Take cover!
This is getting ridiculous. If we can't get this open soon, the boss will have our heads.
Lure it into the trap! I'm counting on you!
Do whatever you're going to do before it kills us all!
My men are ready. Now it's up to you.
Come, my men stand ready on the great porch.
Let's do this. Summon this dragon of yours.
Get it into the trap before it kills us all!
This was your crazy idea, huh?
You better know what you're doing.
I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this.
What? An intruder? Attack, my lovelies!
Ah, another plaything for my collection.
What's happening? No! Leave me alone!
The others do not speak. Their Voices are too powerful for you to withstand.
As my Thane, I'm sworn to your service. I'll guard you, and all you own, with my life.
Nivahriin joorre! What have you done? What twisted Words have you created?! Tahrodiis Paarthurnax! My teeth to his neck!
To feed my power when I come for you in Sovngarde!
Yes. You're right. If they needed to die so that Dawnstar could live, then it was worth the price.
And had they succeeded, Dawnstar's fate would be sealed. You have a unique way of looking at things, my friend.
No! You mustn't listen to them. They speak only lies and deception.
Had we aided them in releasing the Skull, they would use it to wreak havoc across Skyrim. They... they had to die.
It's time. The Skull must be destroyed.
If you'll stand back, I'll perform the ritual granted to me by Lady Mara.
Wait...
Veren... Thorek... you're alive!
No thanks to you, Casimir.
You're a traitor. You left us to die and then ran before the Miasma took you.
No. I... I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.
Enough of your lies!
I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara.
Then you leave me no choice!
Watch your tongue, stranger. We don't take backtalk in this inn.
I long to taste battle again.
I cannot go into battle without a sword, Hjalti.
You don't remember me, Hjalti? Two campaigns we served together. You saved my life time and time again.
Disappointing.
On your way, then.
I thought I was clear when I said I didn't know.
Endon's mold? I'm afraid you have the wrong place, my friend. You'll find no silversmiths here.
sob story
oops, you're trying to weasel out of a lie
No harm done. Tell this Endon fellow I hope he finds what he's looking for.
pretending to think hard
Think I'm going to head out now. Take a long vacation from woodcutting, you know? Good luck.
Come on, what are trying to do? Insult me?
Oh thank goodness! I wasn't sure where else to turn...
Several months ago I ordered a special silver mold from some artisans in Valenwood by way of a Khajiit Caravan.
Well, it never arrived. Later I found out that it was robbed by a group of bandits led by someone named Rigel Strong-Arm.
Look, I talked to the Jarl, the Steward, the Housecarl... everyone. They all told me their resources were spread too thin right now.
trail off
Exactly.
Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild.
Yes, indeed. The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch.
I'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you. Good luck.
Come to gawk at the monster?
Verner, you should have come out with me yesterday. I found the most amazing tree growing right out of a cave.
And I found a new deposit of amber. Would have been nice to have some help pulling it out.
You used to love finding new places.
I still do. I just like to have food waiting for me when I come home.
Sweetheart, did you move my pickaxe?
It's at the south end near that loose rockpile.
So you can be helpful sometimes.
No need to get snippy.
Ever think about spending more time around town?
Not when there's so much to see!
I guess I should join you more often.
You should. I miss you.
Thanks for looking after Hrefna.
Oh, it's no trouble. She's a smart little girl. Might talk your ear off, but she's fun.
Well, I know she thinks the world of you.
Well, I'll try to be a good influence, then.
Sondas, does Hrefna ever mention Meieran to you?
She hardly mentions anything else.
I'm just worried about what he's teaching her.
I wouldn't worry about that. He's a good elf. I trust him.
You're probably right.
Daar sul thur se Alduin vokrii = This day the overlordship of Alduin (is) restored.
Krif voth ahkrin = (you) fight bravely.

You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, [QUOTE]Dah,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Push.[QUOTE]
With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely.
Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of [QUOTE]Dah.[QUOTE]
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Wuld,[QUOTE] which means [QUOTE]Whirlwind.[QUOTE]
Master Borri will teach you [QUOTE]Nah[QUOTE] - [QUOTE]Fury[QUOTE] - the second word of Whirlwind Sprint.

We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout.
I see that you have already begun to learn the Whirlwind Sprint Shout.
Comes with living to a ripe old age, people start thinking there's something magical about you. Then, the insults.
Still, a little knowledge of plants and potions can get you by. Not that anyone likes to admit buying things from you.
See? I even have a little potion for the Steward. Mind handing it over to him? Just say it should solve that problem he has.
Oh... yes... um... thank you. Here you go. Some gold for your assistance and your, discretion.
No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn!
about to fight
You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!
Then go back to your boss and tell him what I've already told him so many times, I lose count.
His request is denied... I'm not paying him any more gold. This madness has to end.
Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.
I'll send word to the strongholds to let you in as one of our own.
Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.
Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes.
We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose.
Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say.
When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die.
And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children?
Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned with myself? I fled... and left my brothers and sisters behind to die.

It's just up here.
Be careful... we're certain to find more of the awakened within.
Thanks! I'm out!
Sondas, I've heard about Morrowind.
Oh? What about it?
That it was black and gross and nobody wanted to live there anymore.
I'll have to take your word on that one, my dear.
Do you ever want to go to Morrowind, Sondas?
I've been in Skyrim my whole life. Why would I want to leave?
To see the fires!
I think I like the lake here just a little more.
And Meieran thinks that we should go there.
I don't want to hear another word about what you're learning from the elf! It's high time you learned to be a Nord, too!
But mama...
He's a half-decent farmer. Ask him to teach you to farm!
Not whispering, but keeping your voice low.
You're thinking this through.  The lockpick idea dawns on you as you say it, but you're not hopeful the player has this ability.
laugh after, like it's hilarious
Oh my... that's the worst one yet. How about we stop talking and keep our eyes open like Gulum-Ei said?
What, seriously? Come on, I thought that was funny!
We go up, yes? Always up.
Such a kind nibble you are.
You, meat! Come, come.
Pitiful, wheedling.
Petra! Petra! Curse her eyes!
Do you like my pretty tower?
Petra! Evil Petra put me here, stole my tower. Hate her, chew her bones! Let me out, kind, kind meat.
Because, because you are such a nice Breton, yes!
Ah, I have a pretty staff. Help me find Petra, wring her neck, pluck her eyes. Take my prize staff, I just want my tower back!
matter of fact.  Not concerned at all about being offensive
Because you are such a very nice Orc?
Live in my tower, roost in my home. Mix pretty poisons and collect shiny eyeballs, yes.
Yes, kind morsel. Let us go up, and mind Melka on the way.
Last sentence is almost to herself.
What? That flower-chewer's died? Then let me out. My tower!
You'd better find that chest that fell off the boat or Gulum-Ei will have your hide!
I know! I know! Just shut up and let me look, okay?
Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open.
What? How did you get this far?
What? No! Get back in your cage!
Is there anything more revolting than spiders? Too many legs...
You know, I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
I can't wait to see what the future brings.
I'll follow you till I'm dust in the breeze. You do realize that?
This place is already starting to feel like home. Must be all the bloodstains.
By the gods... you! But it can't be. You're dead. You... Yeaaaahhhh!
Speak, if you have aught to say worth the listening.
Now you see why I've warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!
So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you.
So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this... we will bow to his wisdom.
We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things.
As for where to find it... such blasphemies have always been the stock in trade of the mages of Winterhold.
They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.
The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax?
Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret.
After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice.
You're learning, Dragonborn. Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult.
I trust that you will make the right choice, in the end. Listen to the Voice that Kynareth has placed within you, and your path will be clear.
Kynareth has placed the Voice of wisdom within you, Dragonborn. All you need do is learn to listen to it, and your path will be clear.
My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here.
Do the right thing. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
We have nothing to talk about until Paarthurnax is dead.
You shouldn't be here, unless you've decided to bring Paarthurnax to justice.
What further business do you have with us?
You have made your choice, Dragonborn. You are not welcome here.
Speak, and then begone.
extremely angry
His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone, and for what?
A mindless vendetta urged on you by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!
Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace, and you are not.
All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law.
They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I have no intention of allowing that to happen here.
Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation.
Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.
I merely wish to talk to you.
I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief.
The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed.
I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it.
The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen.
The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with.
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal.
You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically... intervene directly in events.
My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College.
I'm all too aware that my arrival has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, your Thalmor associate.
Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so.
As you may have learned, this object... The Eye... is immensely powerful.
This world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused.
Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided.
We believe the your efforts should be directed towards dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be.
Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see.
I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College.
His perception may be more coherent than ours.
I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order?
The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us.
I assure you that we mean you no harm.
He was once a student here at the College. Now he is... something different.
I... I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location.
I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part.
Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can.
It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.
So you were right. Go tell the Jarl. Hurry!

Please, get me out of here!
By Sithis, what a mess. I guess this is the end.
You just worry about fulfilling the contract. I'll take care of things on this end.
What? Well - what did she say?
Amaund Motierre? But that would mean...
Hmph. All right, then. Go. Go, my Listener. Find out what that slimy bastard Motierre has to say, then send the Emperor to Sithis.
Ah, but when you're done, there's no use returning here, is there? I was thinking... the Dawnstar Sanctuary. We could make a proper home there.
Listen, when you're finished with this Emperor business, meet Babette and me there. I'll find some way to move the Night Mother. Don't worry. Now go!
And come back with a barrel full of gold, hmm?
Babette, my girl - pack your things. We're moving.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I'll admit, I'm having trouble coming to terms with all of this. I'll just follow Nazir's lead.
Please, make haste. The Emperor's ship won't stayed moored forever. We won't get a chance like this again.
Well I'll be damned. We heard you were dead. Motierre's in the back room, if you've got business.
Who will start?
I'll do it.
The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them.
It's not that you're intruding. I'd wager they've actually expected us.
They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.
What are you doing here, outlander? We don't deal with your kind.
This is our stronghold. Leave.
Outsiders. Nothing but trouble.
Malacath blesses us with this land. It's not for your kind.
This stronghold is for the Orcs. Leave. Now.
We don't know you, and we don't want you here.
Leave, outlander.
You've no right to be here. This place is for Orcs. And Orcs alone.
Outlanders should learn to not wander where they don't belong.
Feel free to trade with our smiths for Orc weapons and armor. Train with my warriors, or purchase poisons from the wise woman.
Welcome to our stronghold, Blood-Kin.
Few outsiders earn the right to enter our strongholds. Speak with more respect, or we might forget your gifts.
What's the bloody hold up in there? How long can it take to run through a few scraggly assassins?
If they were easy to kill, don't you think we would have done it years ago? If our men aren't out in a few minutes, they're dead, trust me.
Anyway, I can smell the smoke. They've already set the place alight.
And so ends the Dark Brotherhood, once and for all. About bloody time.
It's our wedding day. I feel like all of Skyrim is focused on just the two of us.
This is a fine wedding. And to think, it's for us.
This ceremony is so different from an Orc marriage. Less blood.
I never would have dreamed I would be getting married in the Temple of Mara.
Weddings always make me cry. What am I supposed to do now that I'm the one getting married?
It's a simple ceremony, but it'll do. You're here. That's enough.
Who would have thought I would be getting married?
How could you? Just go.
I don't want to see you ever again.
Get away from me. Liar!
You should leave. Now.
Get out. Leave me alone!
You're abandoning me? Me? I never want to see you ever again.
Get out of my sight.
Get out.
Congratulations on your wedding. I'm so happy for both of you.
Just leave.
[QUOTE]Forgiveness is the heart of Mara's blessings.[QUOTE] Very well. We shall re-arrange your wedding.
Tomorrow. Same time as before.
Well I think your betrothed might feel otherwise. The two of you will need to work this out before the temple will marry you.
Under the authority of Mara, the Divine of Love, I declare this couple to be wed.
I present the two of you with these matching rings, blessed by Mara's divine grace. May they protect each of you in your new life together.
You're just going to walk away from your betrothal? Get out of the temple.

My family came here centuries ago. We've made a good living smithing the silver that flows through the city.
But you probably wanted to know about the fancy carvings and stonework, didn't you? Travelers always do.
Here, I have a delivery I need to make to Calcelmo. Why don't you take it to him? He knows the history of Markarth better than anyone.
Do I look like a guide? Only thing I do is sell meat. Now, are you going to buy or not?
Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting to pick that up. Poor Kerah, such a patient woman.
Now, you're supposed to get something for your trouble, aren't you? How about some gold? People seem to like that, I notice.
To protect my research, for one. There are more cutthroat scholars out there who would steal my findings if they got the chance.
And the excavations into Nchuand-Zel are dangerous. Dwemer machines and traps still function even after thousands of years.
Oh, by the Divines is it that obvious? I swear, if my Gunnar was alive to see me now.
This store would finally be on its feet if I hadn't lost my last shipment to Forsworn attacks. A specially-made Dibella statuette.
You aren't for hire, are you? A sellsword? I'll pay you if you can recover that statuette from the Forsworn.
Ah, there it is! This little gold delight is going to keep us afloat for a while. Thank you. Here's something for your hard work.
I'm afraid the Winterhold you see before you is somewhat... underwhelming.
I can assure you, though, that it was quite something in its prime. An early capital of Skyrim, you know.
Sadly, the Oblivion Crisis took its toll on Winterhold, in more ways than one. Then, the Great Collapse swallowed most of our beloved city.
What's there to tell? It's mostly gone now, thanks to those damned mages in the College.
Someday there'll be proof they caused the Great Collapse. Most of a city just dropping off into the sea... That doesn't just happen.
I'm afraid there's not much to be said. Winterhold is hardly what it used to be.
You can talk to Birna if you need to buy anything. She doesn't have much, but could certainly use the coin. And then there's our little inn.
Most of the business we get is from folks here to visit the College, though even that's dried up some.
We'd best be careful in here.
It's starting to look like Esbern was right.
Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords.

Certainly. Be careful.
All right. Don't be long.
You sure? All right. I'll keep guard here.
Don't make me wait too long. I get bored very easily.
Patience isn't exactly my strong suit, but alright.
I'll be right here. Be careful now!
As you wish, my Thane.
Very well. Just be careful!
I'll wait here. Just don't start any trouble without me.
You go on ahead.

Head on, then. I'll keep an eye out.
I'll keep watch from here.

As you will, my Thane. I will protect you with my life.
Let's get going.
I will walk alongside you.
Khajiit walks in your footsteps.
To the next fight.
Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power.
Those that shrank from their destiny... well, you've never heard of them, have you?
And there are the villains - those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk.
But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain.
Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny.
You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who can stop Alduin. Don't forget it.
Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde.
I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior.
Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine.
Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde.
Yes, but it's no easy matter.
But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery!
rejected by a potential lover
Wonderful. Where to begin?
Mara is the Goddess of Love. The temple spreads her gifts by tending to the sick, the poor, and the lost.
We also perform wedding ceremonies for all the loving couples in Skyrim.
Yes. If you were ready, of course. Are you familiar with how marriage works in Skyrim?
Typically, love in Skyrim is as earnest as the people who live here. Life is hard, and short, so there is little room for long courtship.
A person who is looking for a spouse simply wears an Amulet of Mara about the neck, showing they are available.
When another person shows interest, and the two agree to be together, one of them comes to the Temple and we arrange a ceremony.

Alduin's wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes.
Men ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries.
We need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.
And if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled.
But then came the Tongues on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray.
And all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um.
And so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age.
If Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are... gone.
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart.
I tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes.
With a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.
Believe, believe, the Dragonborn comes.
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes.
Beware, beware, the Dragonborn comes.
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows.
You'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come.
We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone. For the age of oppression is now nearly done.
We drink to our youth, to days come and gone. For the age of aggression is just about done.
We'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own. With our blood and our steel we will take back our home.
We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own. With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.
All hail to Ulfric! You are the High King! In your great honor we drink and we sing.
Down with Ulfric the killer of kings. On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.
We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives. And when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!
But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean. Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.
Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!
And the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!
Hearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!
Who was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!
And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!
Mighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!
And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled!
Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!
But a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!
Fair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!

You might just make it. But for now, you're still a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you.
Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are.
Unworthy!
Fall before the will of Sithis!
You dare invade this Sanctuary?
Yeagh!
Heyargh!
The Dread Lord awaits!
I... am Lucien Lachance.
Another soul for you, Father!
I weep for you, mortal.
Another thrall for the Void!
Raaarr!

Pathetic!

You dare invade my home?
Arrogant laughing
You can't kill what's already dead, mortal.
Ha ha! I've suffered worse!
There is no pain in the Void!
You would shut out the darkness?
You wish to kill me? Someone has already had that honor.
Nyargh!
Come on! Do it again! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm bleeding! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ow! Cheap shot!
Is that the best the Listener can do?
By Sithis, I'll see you dead!
You won't get that lucky again!

jilted lover
I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years.
It's not like my poaching is hurting anyone. The Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?
There's enough for all of us if you aren't greedy.
practiced, measured, a ceremonial line you've repeated many times before
Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.
Well, girl, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.
Mirabelle will be waiting for you.
Concerned, becoming frightened
But the world is a dangerous place. Erik has no idea what he's getting himself into.
What's more, he's got no armor. I'll have to save up the money for it.
You would give your own coin to help my son? I'm moved by your compassion.
Your kind deed will not go unrewarded, my friend. Tell Erik I've changed my mind, and we'll visit Whiterun soon to fit him for armor.
I appreciate the gesture, but I'd rather not be in debt to a stranger.
Frightened and a bit peevish.
Cowardly, especially the last bit.
Go ahead, hit me as often as you want. It's not going to change anything, other than to make me and the town guard angry.
I... I cannot deny the truth of what you say. Erik is all the family that I have left, but it's wrong to hold him back as I have.
Go and tell Erik that I've changed my mind. I'll see about borrowing some money in Whiterun for his armor.
Perhaps you should let a father decide what is best for his own son.
I welcome you, friend. How may I serve you?
So many refuse to talk to us. They call us thieves and smugglers. I am glad to see that you are not such a one.
Welcome. If I cannot serve you, I am sure that one of my other traders can do so.
I have traveled far across Tamriel to serve you.
Perhaps you have encountered Ma'dran or Akhari? Both are sworn to me, and both have worthy goods to offer.
The road makes this one weary.
The wind blows bitter cold in this place.
The longer we travel the roads of Skyrim, the more empty this land seems.
The warm sand of Elsweyr is far away from here.
The roads of Skyrim lead to many dangers.
We are creatures of the desert. The north wind chills us to the bones.
There is much beauty in this place.
How high the mountains of Skyrim rise!
A peaceful greeting to you.
It is a strange sight, the white flakes that sometimes fall from the sky.
The air is so clear in Skyrim, one can see forever.
A welcome to you, fellow traveler.
Khajiit welcomes you, and also your coin.
Do you seek to make a purchase?
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin.
Fortune smiles upon this meeting.
Welcome to you.
Warm sands, friend. How may this one serve you?
Please, come and browse our goods.
May your bed be warm and your food sweet.
You honor Khajiit with your presence.
Many fine things are here for you, friend.
Come and see what is for sale, traveler.
May the sun warm your path, friend.
Speak to one of the others if you wish to buy something.
This Khajiit guards the others.
Bring your coins, but do not bring trouble.
Khajiit is always watching for thieves and pickpockets.
Khajiit is ready for any troublemakers.
If you have come to see our wares, speak to the others.
Welcome to Khajiit's humble camp.
Khajiit is just a guard, and has no wares to sell.
Blessings of the moons upon you, traveler.
Some come to buy, but others come to steal. Khajiit shows no mercy to thieves.
Khajiit are not welcome in the cities, so we make our camps outside the walls.
There is no trust for Khajiit in this place.
Soon it will be time to replenish our supply of water.
The road takes us past many cold rivers. We can fill our skins there.
If the river is not frozen to ice, perhaps.
Longing, craving
Longing (like a drug addict)
Longing
Put the thought out of your mind, and do not speak of it again.
It has been a profitable journey, and yet I long for the warm sands of Elsweyr more and more each day.
I feel the same. I do not think Khajiit were made for the cold.
Not only that, but these Nords have no love for us. They look upon us and see only thieves and smugglers.
It is a pity, but it cannot be helped. Perhaps if we continue to show that we can be trusted, they will open their cities to our caravans.
Hah! I wish that I had your optimism.
We have been in this land for so long, I have forgotten what it feels like to walk on warm sand.
Yes, I know just what you mean. My toes are numb from the cold more often than not.
Do you ever find that you regret making this journey?
In truth, I do not. I have always dreamed of seeing new lands, and it does not hurt that we are making a good profit.
That is true. Perhaps I should be more grateful for this opportunity. Not many Khajiit can say that they have visited Skyrim.
All this talk of dragons returning to the world makes me more than a little nervous.
Moons protect us! I hope we do not encounter one of them on the road.
I suppose if we do, we will find out just how fast each of us can run.
As the saying goes, you do not need to be faster than the dragon; you need only be faster than your friends.
Do you believe all this talk of dragons? Can the ancient ones truly have returned?
I wish I could say that I did not, but in every part of Skyrim, there is talk of dragon sightings. It is no coincidence.
We are fortunate. We travel lightly, and can escape at a moment's notice. We have no home that a dragon can burn to the ground.
I feel pity for these Nords. When the dragons attack cities and towns, they will lose everything.
And we will lose customers. Let us hope that if there are dragons, there are only a few and they are not too foul-tempered.
I wonder if we should offer discounts to the soldiers.
The soldiers? From which side, the Stormcloaks, or the Imperials?
Both. One or the other is bound to win the war eventually. Why not curry favor now, so that the victor will look upon us kindly?
Hah, you have the foresight of a Khajiit in a sandstorm. If we offer a discount to both sides, the winners will persecute us for helping the losers.
Hm. I had not thought of it that way.
Between the war and the return of the dragons, I wonder if we should not leave Skyrim and ply our trade elsewhere.
I admit, the dragons are a concern, but we can avoid them if we do not stay in one place for too long.
That may be, but what of the war? That is not so easy to escape from.
The war? That is not a reason to leave, it is a reason to stay.
And what makes you think that?
Because war is good for business, of course.
thinking as your talking
If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard.
No. It's some sort of crazy contraption Mercer commissioned for quick escapes.
I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.
chuckle at beginning
Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal.
say with a [QUOTE]wink[QUOTE]
That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.
The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.
Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey.
Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details.
Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off of his corpse... I could care less.
Of mine? What is it?
No visitors. No way. Now piss off, before ya' make me mad.
I can't believe it! How did ya' talk her into this?
Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta' work for Maven anymore.
Here, ya' did me a favor, I guess I owe you one.
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away unless ya' can talk Maven Black-Briar into letting me outta' my debt.
You try and set one foot in this yard, and I'll cut it off.
It's just across the bridge and up that hill.
We're close now. I can see the camp.
My men? What did you do? You'll die for this.
Wait, it's haunted? I don't like ghosts... let me think about this for a minute...
Why don't you go in there and get it?
Hmm....
Wait... who in blazes is this?
Oh! Um, he he... Hold on... I... I can explain...
Valmir, you rat. You're not a soldier at all! Must be one of the Thalmor!
I'm a Forsworn. One of our raids went bad, and I got captured.
Would've been fine dying for the Reach with my kinsmen, but the Silver-Bloods want their ore mined, so they threw me in here.
Murder. Banditry. Assault. Theft. And lollygagging.
Year seven, I think? Surprised I haven't cut my own throat out by now, but something keeps me going.
Guards brought me in about 12 years ago. Was running a good group of bandits up until then.
But these Forsworn. They're nothing like the men I cobbled together. They're real killers.
Guards say I murdered someone. I was just sleeping off some mead in my aunt's house, but that didn't stop them from arresting me.
I don't even know who they said I killed.
A couple of years? I wasn't a Forsworn when I came, but I joined up when I got in. Easier that way.
Don't want to talk about it.
Long enough.
The first time? Thieving. The second time? Thieving. The third time? Thieving. It kind of keeps going like that.
First it was 6 months, then a year, then 2 years. Now I'm in for life.
Have the books, do you? I mean, I'm very glad. That's wonderful.
You could, you know, let me out of this cage now.
The undercroft is ahead... ugh, Necromancers. Be careful.
The library is just through here. We're getting close now.
And the outpost at Dragon Bridge?
It'll be shuttered by the end of the month.
Very good. And you'll be returning to... Well, if you don't mind me asking, where exactly will you be going now, sir?
thoughtful... introspective at first... then he sort of snaps out of it.
Oh... I see. Well then, let me be just say that it's been an honor serving under you Commander Maro.
The honor has been mine. You should be proud of what we've accomplished here. The Dark Brotherhood is no more. And the Emperor, finally, is safe.
happy and hopeful
And, once more, I prove Commander Maro the fool. I told him you can't stop the Dark Brotherhood. Never could.
My uncle Dengeir was Jarl until a short time ago. His old age and failing health caught up with him, and he stepped down.
He now serves us honorably as Thane, and to the great benefit of the hold, I now serve as Jarl.
Karliah's been through here. What does she expect to find?
The stench in here... this place smells of death. Be on your guard.
Pull the chain over there, and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all of the traps.
There's two more of them ahead.
Bone chimes... clever. Rigged to wake the draugr I'd bet. Don't blunder into any of them.
Karliah always was a nimble minx... slipping passed these draugr must be child's play for her.
We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.
Condescending, pompous
Amused condescension for the second line. The speaker does not think the player will ever actually be a jarl.
It was Dengeir who made me a steward, long ago when he was young.
When Dengeir's health began to fail, young Sidgeir was appointed Jarl in his stead. It was simpler just to keep me as steward.
Sidgeir has no interest in running his hold, and so leaves such matters to me. As for my part, I do my best to see that folk are treated fairly.
Many battles have been fought here over the centuries. Graves were dug and monuments built, and the town grew around these.
In time, Falkreath came to be known as the heroes' graveyard. Many noble Jarls and renowned warriors asked to be buried here.
Falkreath's reputation has faded somewhat, but the graves remain, reminding us of the one inevitable truth of life.
That door up ahead... looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.
Spooky, ghostly warning
He'll answer any questions you have.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get him killed.
She'll answer any questions you have.
Try not to disappoint. Or to get her killed.
Ysgramor was the hero who started the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon.
He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves.
But not all of them, because some of them are still here.
It was the blade hefted by Ysgramor when he returned to drive the elves out of the old Skyrim.
Without that axe, this whole land would be overrun still.
Wuuthrad is a relic of Ysgramor. Through that weapon, we trace our line straight to the first harbinger of makind in this land.
What fragments we have are displayed in honor, but we always seek more.
I watch you to make sure you are honorable.
If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you brother.
If you are honorable and strong, then I can call you sister.
I would hope that's obvious.
Do well here, and you'll be a full member of the Companions.
Fail, and it won't matter anyway.
Bad people who don't like werewolves.
So they don't like us either.
A group of werewolf hunters who have gotten wise to our little secret.
They've made it their mission to hunt us down, but we are hunters ourselves.
Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody.
Not all of us, just the members of the Circle. We shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas-reliefs... almost entirely intact!
Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead.
urging him to stay focused on the task at hand
Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...
She sold the city out to the Aldmeri Dominion. Were it not for her betrayal, Taneth could have held its ground in the war.
The other noble houses discovered her betrayal and she fled. They want her brought back alive.
The resistance against the Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell, and they want justice.
You have? Where? Tell me now!
Money, if that is what you wish.
Now tell me where she is!
We cannot go after her, not without drawing attention.
You must bring her to us.
Lead her to the Whiterun stables, outside of the city. We will wait for you there.
All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?
What do you mean? That wine tastes finer than anythin' Surilie Brothers ever made.
Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem. You said it can make the darkness as clear as day when you drink it. Guess what? It doesn't.
Am I responsible if the vintage was off on that case? Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds.
Puttin' together another shipment from Morrowind, Vekel. Lookin' for anythin' special?
Well, if some Moon Sugar should fall into your lap...
Maybe. That stuff's gettin' tough to bring across the border with all the Argonian patrols.
Well if it turns up, I'll be willing to buy.
You need to tell your boys to place nice, Delvin. Almost threw two of them into the well last night.
They aren't my boys. Do I look like the leadin' type?
You know what I mean. Tell your boss that rough is rough, but when someone pulls a dagger fun time is over.
I'll pass it along.
Good news. I found that dwarven hammer you were looking for.
You did? Thanks. I get you the rest of your coin by tomorrow.
Yeah, funny thing about that. The price was a hundred higher than I expected.
Vekel, you have no shame. I'll get you the rest like I said. I want that hammer.
Why can't you just settle down and run the Flagon with me?
I don't want to settle. I like things the way they are.
Come on, Ton. Marry me. Let me take care of you.
I can take care of myself.
upset and angry
Look, I need to know. What's going on between you and Brynjolf?
That's all they are... rumors. So quit worrying.
I need you to do me a favor, Dirge.
Sure, Ton. You know I'm good for it.
There's a new guard nosing around the meadery. Can you do something about it?
Gladly. He won't bother you anymore, I promise.
Please milady, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?
Please my lord, can you spare a gold coin for an old woman?
Please help me, I'm starving.
Please, I don't have anything to eat.
Can you spare any coin?
Spare a septim?
Edda, you know well I barely have any coin to call my own. I'm sorry.
You must be starving. Here, spend it well.
All right, all right. Here.
Yes, I hope this helps.
Yes, of course. This war is causing your woes, it's hardly your fault.
Certainly, good lady. Here.
Are you joking? Go earn a living and stop loafing!
I would if I could, but I can barely make ends meet.
Of course, here. Be well.
Maybe you should look for work instead of begging for coin.
Here you are.
Oh you poor thing! Come by the temple and my husband and I will keep you fed.
Edda, Edda. There's no need for this. Just come by the temple and we'll care for you.
Sorry, all out of coin.
I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. Leave me alone.
Ugh, you reek. Get out of my way.
Here you go, dear.
Oh, very well. Just try and clean yourself up.
Get away from me, you filthy woman.
Spare a coin?
If you could spare a septim, I'd be grateful.
Help out an old man here with some coin, would you?
Hey, can I get a gold or two?
I could sure use some coin.
No. Now shove off.
Snilf, it's me. I don't have a roof over my head either, remember?
Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.
Again? Buy some food this time will you?
Another uncounted causality of this war. Here you are, you poor man.
Certainly, my good man. Here.
You're disgusting, stay away from me.
If I had even a pot to piss in, I'd gladly share. Sorry.
Yes, I hope this helps you.
Absolutely. Here you are. Be well.
Ugh, you smell horrible. Get yourself cleaned up.
Very well, here.
Oh you poor thing, you must be starving. Come to the temple later and let us feed you.
Snilf, I told you begging isn't the answer. I expect to see you at the temple later.
Sorry, no time. I'm late.
If you want to awaken from your next slumber, I suggest you leave me be.
What? No. Get away from me.
I suppose. Just get something to eat and stay away from the Bee and Barb for a change.
Very well, please use it for food.
Never. Now move aside.
That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours.
Meet us here when you're ready.
Why are the potions I requested not completed?
I'm sorry, milady. The components for those elixirs are quite volatile and in some cases, very dangerous to handle. I must take care.
Excuses are not acceptable in my court. When I ask for something I expect results, and I expect them immediately.
Yes, milady. Sorry, milday. They will be completed.
There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him.
The execution will proceed as planned.
But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment.
Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward.
No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned.
Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?
Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified.
Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it.
I'm almost certain he'll reach the Imperial City tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week.
Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?
I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.
Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs.
I'll let him know.
Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.
Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time.
It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.
Let's just say my mother knows which pockets to line and keep it at that.
So, have you thought about what I said?
I find the concept of sleeping with you not only repulsive, but morally unsettling. Does that answer your question?
You listen to me. I'd be careful wagging that pretty little tongue at me like that otherwise I may just have it cut off.
Just stay away from me and maybe I won't weave a spell to shrink something that matters to you.
Maul, can I ask a personal favor of you?
Well that depends on what the favor is, now doesn't it.
It's Hemming. He's making advances and I can't bear the man's presence. Is there anything you can do?
I'll talk to him, but he's stubborn. He's like his mother; he sees what he wants and he won't quit until he has it.
Anything you can do to keep his filthy hands off of me would be a welcome change.
My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from Hammerfell... with minimal losses.
For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter.
The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen.
And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure. Just see to it the items are secured and the rest disposed of properly this time.
I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point.
Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones.
This is an utter waste of time.
Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!
Very well, I'll keep practicing them.
Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get.
I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.
I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder.
I'll make sure it's sent right away.
Niluva, you promised me you'd pay me back yesterday. So what's the story?
Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.
If you'd stop wasting your coin on that skooma, you'd have enough gold to live on.
Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow.
How do you do it, Valindor? How do you work at Black-Briar Meadery and the Fishery without getting exhausted?
Oh, it's not so terrible. I actually find the work quite relaxing.
Relaxing? They must be working you to the bone! You should rest before you do yourself in.
Not to worry, dear Svana. I promise you I can handle it, but your concern is quite flattering.
Wujeeta, you really need to stop using that skooma. It's very bad for your health and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to you.
I can't, Valindor. It won't let me go. It's taking over my life.
It's an evil substance. Whoever's selling it to you should be brought to justice.
If there was any justice in the world, I'd just get this over with and die peacefully.
Wujeeta, you're worrying me. You look so... well, so sad.
Don't worry about it, Svana. It's my problem... no need for you to get involved.
Look, if you're in some sort of trouble, I could talk to Haelga.
No, no... please, I'm just tired is all. Thank you.
So how are things with you and Bolli?
How do you think? He's a pig. All I am to him is a warm body to lay with.
Nivenor! How can you say that? He gives you everything you ask for.
If I cared for your opinion on our affairs, I'd ask. Now, if you'll excuse me.
You found it? I've been looking for that blade for months. You took on all those bandits yourself?
Thank you. Here, my father had a favorite sword and shield technique. Let me teach it to you, in honor of his memory.
Bless you, friend. You have renewed my hope.
Before I came into Zenithar's calling, I confess I was a thief. But I learned a few things in my time that might help you survive. Let me show you.

Ah, yes, I can imagine you'd want to settle that score. Last I heard he was at the Solitude Docks, conducting the Emperor's departure.
The poor child is probably beggin' for us to string up her murderin' father.
Best tell the Jarl.
The spirit world is strong in this place.
Look to the graveyard. That is where you'll find her.
You saw her ghost?
I'm glad it was you and not me.
She's buried outside of town. That's where I'd look.
Give it to me quickly, before they see us together. You've riled up the priestesses, and the guards don't take kindly to that.
Here's your share. Nicely done.

You disrespected the Brotherhood. And it'll cost you. You want back into the Family, you pay the price. 500 gold, and all is forgiven.
You may be Listener, and head of the Sanctuary, but your recent behavior sets a bad example. I must insist you pay a fine of 300 gold.
If the Tenets were still in place, you would be required to defeat the Wrath of Sithis. Now you just need to pay a fine to Nazir. Ah, the Old Ways...
When you disrespect your Family, you disrespect yourself. Don't you care for anything at all? Prove that you do - speak with Nazir, make reparations.
Bah. If it were up to me, we'd cut off your hands and never let you back in this Sanctuary. But no. All you have to do is pay Nazir a fine. Pathetic.
Ah, don't worry, we all like to break the rules sometimes. Just see Nazir and pay the fine. Seems I do that at least once a month...
There are so few rules here. All we ask is that you don't disrespect your Family. But for some reason, you have. Best talk to Nazir and pay the fine.
Idiot. I may not have a lot of rules, but that doesn't give you free reign to do as you please. You want to resume your duties? Go talk to Nazir.
Oh, but Cicero can't talk to you. You've been naughty, naughty. I think you need to clear this whole mess up with Nazir.
Looks like Cicero's not the only only one to go a little crazy from time to time. Eh, Listener? You should talk to Nazir, work this whole mess out.
With all due respect, Listener, you broke what few rules we seem to have. Nazir insists you talk to him and work this issue out.
I do apologize, Listener, but Nazir made it clear the initiates are not to speak with you until you first deal with him, and atone for your actions.
Good. I'll spread the word that you've made reparations. Now let's forget the past and get back to business...
Excellent. Now we can get back to business. I think it's best we just forget this ever happened and move on, hmm?
Then I suggest you [QUOTE]collect[QUOTE] it. Until you pay the fine, you are effectively cut off from all Dark Brotherhood duties and contracts.
Shocked and angry. Says [QUOTE]no respect[QUOTE] like he hardly believes what he's hearing.
I understand, Listener. And I hope you understand that until the fine is paid, I must insist you refrain from all Dark Brotherhood business.
My pa always warned me about these things!
Damn dustmen! Why don't you stay dead?
Just what I was afraid of!
Damn dustmen!
with baffled disgust
Look out! Draugr!
It must be the Stormcloaks! Find them!
It's got to be the Imperials! Find them!
Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else.
I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it.
He didn't say, but you'd better move fast.
There's probably something I could find for you to do, but best to check with him.
I don't know, but he sounded impatient.
I did. Your time, it seems, has come.
Yes, and we have something special for you this time.
the word [QUOTE]scholar[QUOTE] should be dripping with contempt
He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out.
Aela will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.
Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp.
So I'm told. Try and keep up.
So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.
Ah, you're back.
Me? I'm Burguk's brother. I came back after serving many years in the Legion.
By then, Burguk had already become chief, and he welcomed me home as family, not a rival as is tradition.
I did. I was known as Ghorbash gro-Dushnikh in those days, in honor of my homeland.
Many Orcs leave the stronghold to join the Legion. They welcome our skill in battle and smithing, and we welcome a chance to see the world.
I do. There is a freedom the roads give you that the stronghold does not.
But I have a place here, and I wouldn't want to dishonor my clan by leaving again like some young pup.
I couldn't. It would dishonor the place the chief has made for me.
You're right. Look at me, talking in circles like some old wise woman. Very well, outlander. You have my axe when you need it.
Yes, but I am honor-bound to stay here.
Well, for that much, I don't think Malacath would turn his scowl on me. All right, outlander. My axe is yours.
My honor isn't so cheap, outlander.
I'm not a coward, outlander. You want me to prove it? Fine. My axe is yours. To the most dangerous corners of Skyrim and back.
I am Larak's daughter. Soon, I'll be of age and will be sent to marry an Orc chief in some distant stronghold.
Until then, I train. My new home will need strength, and my new sisters must know I am not weak when I arrive.
No. A chief's daughter marries who her chief wishes. It ensures the stronghold receives a fair trade in goods for my absence.
I used to look forward to the day when I was of age, to see new places and people, but now it feels like a cage.
Yes, but I must stay here and wait for the day when I'll be married and sent to another stronghold.
It is our way, and I am proud to follow my people's traditions, but I can't help but feel chained.
I couldn't. It would shame my chief and my mother and foremothers.
You're right. Malacath teaches us to meet our fate. Perhaps this is mine.
What do you know about my people, outlander?

Come out and face me, you coward!
I can smell your fear.
I can hear your heart beating.
Hiding? The shadows are my domain!
Hiding only prolongs the inevitable.
I know you're here. Show yourself.
I'll find you... it's only a matter of time.

You can't hide from me!

This shouldn't take long.
So, it begins.
Where'd you come from?

Guess it was nothing after all.
I must've been hearing things.
They picked on the wrong old man.
Haven't fought like that in years.
That was fun.
Waste of time.
Didn't even work up a sweat.
Pathetic.
That's what happens when you cross the Guild.
I think they got the message.
Damn, just as I was getting warmed up.
I hardly felt a thing.
And that's why I'm the best.
The afterlife will bring you darkness.

I send you to your rest.
You were no match for a Nightingale.
Shadows consume you.
That wasn't a fight, it was an execution.
So ends the lesson.
That was hardly worth my time.
How disappointing.
Hmph. Hardly a challenge.
That'll teach you to cross me.
That's the end of that.
Oh come now, resorting to petty tricks are we?
A bold but foolish move.
You cannot escape!
Come back here!
Where are you?
You can't hide forever!
You can't get away from me!
Show yourself!
finished searching after losing track of someone
Enough of this! Fight me!
So, you reveal yourself!
Ha, found you!
That is a fine idea. The stronghold would need the gold when I left to marry, anyway. I am ready when you are.
No. That won't be enough.
I am not weak. Very well, outlander, I will go with you whenever you are ready.
You dare challenge a child of Malacath?
Thank you for asking.
You wouldn't be a sellsword, would you? I have a little problem you could solve.
I used to be an adventurer in my day, then I settled down. Got married.
I may have accidentally let a prisoner escape. The leader of one of those bandit groups.
I told everyone he died during questioning, and I need you to track him down and make sure he doesn't show up to disprove that.
That's right. Used to explore all over. I'm the one who originally found the mine Darkwater Crossing was built around.
I was actually scouting a bit the other day, old times sake. Spied a brigand heading back to his camp.
Up for a little hunting? My husband is being a sad stick, so I can't go myself.
Whenever a group of marauders attack a Nord village, Ulfric is the first to sound the horn and send the men.
But a group of Dark Elf refugees gets ambushed? A group of Argonians, or a Khajiit caravan? No troops. No investigation. Nothing.
There's a group of cutthroats out there right now that Ulfric doesn't lift a finger to bring to justice, as long as they don't threaten Nord land.
Good. I'll have a sack of coin waiting for you when you get back.
This brings back memories. Come back when you're done and maybe I'll be up to showing you a few tricks.
That's a brave offer. I'd be happy to throw in my coin behind that.
You deal with them, I'll make sure you get paid. Maybe this old soldier will throw in some lessons as well.
Fair enough.
Yes. It is.
That's a load off my mind. Here's your pay.
You remind me of myself a few years ago. Let me show you a little bit about wearing light armor. It's helped me out whenever I was scouting.
Now I've got the itch to travel again. If you're leaving town, I wouldn't mind coming with for a while.
Now that's good work. Everyone will be a lot safer with them gone, Dark Elf and Nord alike.
Here, some gold as promised, and let me show you a bit about wearing heavy armor. Save you some aches on a long march.
My husband. We used to go out in the wilds and collect ingredients together. He used to call me his [QUOTE]pretty Juniper.[QUOTE]
It's quite romantic, if you're an alchemist. Frost took the old fool a few seasons back, while he was looking for the Ring of Pure Mixtures.
I found the ring's resting place after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now.
I am. I came into Arkay's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics.
I'm fortunate that Kust and the people of Falkreath have come to accept me as one of their own.
Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.
I was the finest scout in the Legion, once. Tracked down all the places in the wilds that were causing people trouble.
Lost my helmet in one of the old caves. My pretty, pretty helmet. Life just got worse after that. Kept losing things. So many things....
Yes. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to Kynesgrove. My clan was one of the first to settle here.
Legend says that my forefather Lenne discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead.
Of course, there's another story of Lenne losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe.
Of course I am. What do I look like, a tavern wench?
Ah, don't let my words cut you too deep. I've just been working the forge too hard. Trying to set this sword right.
Well, aren't you sweet? I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me.
Blessing of Arkay to you for your help.
Oh, you could? I sure would love to have it again. Could show you some of my old scouting tricks.
According to my grandfather at least. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into.
Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.
Jarl wants it to look like an ancient blade. High Queen Freydis ruled over Windhelm in the Second Era, and her sword was legendary.
Getting the real sword would be even better than making a copy, but no one wants to risk getting it from its resting place.
If you find that sword, traveler, I'd be grateful.
Why am I not surprised?
So many things lost....
Well, I never claimed otherwise.
Pfft. Ungrateful milk drinker.
Thank you. Here, let an old alchemist pass on some of her secrets to you.
Thank you. It's a collection of regrets that I try not to forget. Here, I promised you this.
Look at it. That's real Nord craftsmanship, that is! Let me show you an old trick I learned as a scout. Makes it harder for the enemy to notice you.
My clan's shield. So Lenne really did stumble into that cave and was eaten by monsters.
In honor of his memory, let me show you a few shield techniques. And tell me if you're leaving town. Be good to travel again.
Look at that edge. Still sharp.
I'll present this to the Jarl later. As for you, let me show you some smithing techniques.

So what are you doing here? Lorkhan's eyes, you can't let the Thalmor get to him first! Get back to Riften!
Did you tell him you were Dragonborn? I didn't think so.
Lorkhan's eyes, do I have to do everything myself? Get back to Riften before the Thalmor find him!
Hasn't she told you? We were both Blades, back when that still meant something.
Now we're just fellow fugitives from the Thalmor. I didn't know she was still alive, but I'm not surprised. She was a survivor.
Well. They've been hunting down Blades since the Great War, on general principle.
But if you mean me, now, in particular... maybe they've started to get an inkling of what the return of the dragons means.
I don't suppose they want the world to end any more than we do. Or at least, they'd prefer to end it on their terms.
Haven't you been paying attention to anything I've said? Only you can finally defeat Alduin and avert the end of the world!
If we can just find out what this Dragonrend Shout is, you may have a chance.
Or not. There's no guarantee with prophecy. Merely hope.
If we can just find out what Shout the ancient Nords used, you may have a chance.
It's the prophecy, don't you see? Only a Dragonborn can stop Alduin and avert the end of the world!
But... I don't yet know how you can stop him. The prophecy doesn't say. But Alduin's Wall does. I hope.
Not yet, not yet. When we get to Riverwood... with Delphine... I'll tell you both then, when I've collected my thoughts.

The research I've done seems to indicate that Skorm Snow-Strider left part of his journal here after laying siege.
I believe it should indicate how to enter the blocked off sections of the stronghold.
I should warn you, Forelhost is quite haunted, but I'm sure you can handle it. Return to me here once you've obtained the staff.
Me? No, I'm too important to the war effort to risk life and limb in there... Besides, that's what I'm paying you for.
It seems that after the strength of the Cult was broken in the Dragon War a last contingent came here to create a stronghold and regroup.
King Harald's forces crushed stragglers here the during the First Era and it has been haunted ever since, but the specifics of the siege are unclear.
They were among the first men to arrive from Atmora and they worshipped certain animals as avatars of the Gods; Dragons being foremost.
And for their bloody sacrifices, the Dragons gifted their priests with terrible power.
But their cruelty was too great for men to bear, and they rose up in what would be called the Dragon War and the Cult swept from the land.
you are lying to the player, pretending to be an officer
No, I suppose we haven't. Brelyna Maryon, of House Telvanni. First of my family to leave Morrowind in a long time.
Now I'm here to study Conjuration. That's what's important.
Didn't you know?
Before the Oblivion Crisis, many elves called Winterhold their home. More visited the College from Morrowind every year.
After, growing distrust of magic made life difficult for many. Some left rather than endure the growing hatred from the local Nords.
Others returned home after the Red Year, when Vvardenfell erupted and caused much destruction.
Winterhold itself died in the years between then and now. What's left out there is a husk. Only the College really remains.

Not that I require validation, of course. There are just some - and I shan't name names - who would disagree.
It can make life difficult when one's colleagues fail to recognize the research one engages in.

Now, do you require assistance?

Mages need to be reminded to be careful around research materials.
gruff, but proud
If you require assistance with summoning techniques, please let me know.
If you would, please also contain your summons to the College grounds. The locals do not need to be agitated further by Atronachs roaming their town.
The summoning of undead is even less advisable outside of the College.
By Sheor, no. Those archaic policies died out with the Mages Guild, and were never enforced here.
Necromancy, as any other type of magic, is a tool to be used.
Of course, non-mages may not see it that way, so we don't go around flaunting it.
Do not cross the bridge unaided!
You risk death by doing so, and you shall not gain entry.

So you have the Voice, then? I would be quite impressed to see that.
You do indeed have the power. I'm impressed.
Please, follow me. I'll escort you inside the College.
The key to wards is that they take time to charge.
Also, if your ward isn't negated by an incoming spell, it will recharge itself after a moment or two.
Just be careful. Casting wards requires constant concentration, and you can easily find yourself drained of your magicka reserves.

Only way you could have found one of those is by stealin' it. Guess you'll fit in around here better than I thought.
So what do you want to know?
The name's Maul; I watch the streets for the Black-Briars. If you need dirt on anything, I'm your guy.
Do I look like a merchant to you? You're going to have to take that up with Vex in the Thieves Guild.
Get in good with them and you'll find her.
Not exactly. The crown is what the Guild calls a paragon; an object that enhances our thieving abilities.
At least, that's what I'm told it does... there hasn't been a paragon in this Guild for hundreds of years.
If we want to stay on top in Skyrim, the Guild needs that paragon back.
Without it, we're just a bunch of petty thieves.
When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power.
Dragons have always been able to Shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being.
There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking.
In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do.
For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout.
But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort.

If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do.
The Greybeards are so afraid of power that they won't use it.
Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin?
No. And they're afraid of you, of your power.
Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?
with an avaricious gleam in his eye
No... No, as tempting as it is, it won't do to have both sides angry at us.
The College has had enough trouble staying out of the war. No need to make it worse.
You take that book to General Tullius or Ulfric and let them have their little triumph. It will be delivered back here to me soon enough.
They live in seclusion near the top of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
They're masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting.
It's a great honor for them to summon you. They speak to very few - in fact, they hardly speak at all.
No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons.
You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear.
The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do.
Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods.
True mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions.
In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.
We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller.
Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar.
But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.
serenely - this is sort of a mantra for the Greybeards
We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though.
For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do.
But we never found one. Until now.
The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back.
There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.

There he is!
No escape this time, foul worm!
Careful!
Uh-oh.
This is not good.
Be careful. The Forsworn are just as dangerous as they look.

Good. I can use the practice.
Here we go.
On guard!
Ah ha.
So it wasn't my imagination.
Ach, there you are.
I've got one!
Bad move.
This won't take long.
Too slow.
This is how it's done.
If you really think you can manage...
I mean, I'd hate to leave now and find out later you met some horrible fate at the hands of the Caller.
But if you insist, I suppose I'll be on my way. Thank you, and good luck.
Yes, let's!
Really, I think there's been a mistake.
May I just speak with her, please, to clear all this up?
Just let me out of here. I only wanted to help you!
Okay, now can you let me out? Please? I won't tell anyone it was you.
Just open the cage, and I'll leave quietly. Won't make a sound, won't bother you at all.
Quiet down.
Stop your whining.
She said you stay in there, and that's final.
I'll give you something to cry about if you don't quiet down.
Angered, offended.
So be it. We gave you a choice.
We believe the place in our vision to be Karthwasten.
Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.

I'm not looking for a conversation.

Of course I'm sure! He was asking about Esbern.
Of course I'm sure! She was asking about Esbern.
dismissively
For your help, I'm sending word to the Orc strongholds that you're to be trusted. You should be welcome there now.
Yes. I earned the right by slaying my father in single combat.
One day, I will have a son who will challenge me when I become too old to lead, and the stronghold will have a new chief.
Until then, I alone have the right to have wives and children. It ensures our strength.
Are you a sellsword? I don't like your kind. No honor. No loyalty. Unreliable.
But I can't turn away a potential ally in these times. Let's see if you're better than a common mercenary.
My scouts have tracked down one of the Forsworn leaders, hiding out in their blood-soaked camps. Deal with them.
We will see.
Then leave.
I'm impressed. Forsworn usually make short work of mercenaries, but you took care of them. Here is your reward.
Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.
You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover.
The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you.
The contracts I dole out are fairly simple - go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different.
The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.
You're headed to The Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison.
And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself.
You're only young once. Trust me, I know.
Yes. Just because you're now a professional assassin, don't think you have to skulk around in the dark like a skeever and stab people.
Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time.
You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself.
I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well.
She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head.
Of course, they'd probably already be dead...
But you know what I mean!
You're joking. While I can understand if some family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule.
Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.
Does she? Listen, sister... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit... paranoid.
Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never.
Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals.
And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.
To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.
Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others.
You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother.
The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious...
So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that.
But, I will serve gladly, as that's my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly.
If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener... your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power.
laughing, mocking.
Your contract sounds simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?

A disappointed [QUOTE]tsk[QUOTE] at the beginning.
But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude?
If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard.
giggles at the end. Like, [QUOTE]See, don't you get it?[QUOTE]
Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once.
It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there's is a difference! Stupid cow.
I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception.
There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill.
I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.
What's the matter, Listener? Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers?
You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect... for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.
Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.

Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common.
emphasis on the word [QUOTE]are[QUOTE]
Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him.
I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable.
Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!
Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.
Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.
Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it.
All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this.
Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons...
...go murder a clown.
I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways.
Our actions were shameful. Surely, the Night Mother weeps this day.
The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you've proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family... and to me.
Hmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet - alerting others will be the real threat.
Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven.
That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...
Yes - don't kill the Gourmet!
Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, less flavorful place.
You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool... the sea.
Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect.
You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular.
Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up.
Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef - it only makes sense.
Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications.
Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an Atronach to cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away. Use your imagination!
What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis.
I am so very happy for you. If not a bit... envious.
Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate.
It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep.
Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener.
Look. If you're trying to get to know me - don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But...
My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad.
Here's all you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.
I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf.
So you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did.
Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods [QUOTE]unsettling.[QUOTE] The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently.
What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns.
In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle.
I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes.
I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me!
laughs when she says it
In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably... fresh.
Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally - you can see how painful that would have been for mother.
But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha!
When I was thirteen I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely.
says the word [QUOTE]glory[QUOTE] like it stirs some evil emotion in him. Like the Emperor from Star Wars.
Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching.
Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary.
I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good.
This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I first discovered my, shall we call it [QUOTE]aptitude,[QUOTE] for elimination.
I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on.
I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood, and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are.
Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind you'll find in Skyrim, that's for damned sure.
I am a child of Hammerfell, born of the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe.
My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. But the Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back.
Ah, well, I'm Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like you. Hmph. No, definitely not like you.
Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I... keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy...
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray, that one will come to hear her say...
The words.
But I am not the Listener. Oh no. You are the Listener! You heard the words! And everything will soon be put right.
Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that is an age long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.
Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect.
Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.
The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.
Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long.
Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing.
Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do.
But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy.
I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters.
As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve.
Welcome, people of Solitude! We of the Bards College are pleased to be here to celebrate the Burning of King Olaf.
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our latest applicant.
The festival would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our most recent inductee.
With the lighting of the effigy...
He becomes a full-fledged member of the Bards College. Please welcome our newest Bard!
We remember all those Solitude soldiers out fighting the good fight in this thankless war.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it.
You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me.
You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good.
All right, let's not overdo it.
Meet me at my quarters.
I hope you've got some coin.
Let's just take a look then.
Well then you'd better have something I really want to buy.
You're the one who's coming to Japhet's Folly with us, right? You ready to go?
Well, hurry it up!
Well... if you say so.
Move along. Nothing to see here.
Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into.
That could have turned out better.
I can't believe I got caught.
Oh, you wanted the attic room? Why didn't you say so the first time?
The thing is... we don't actually have an attic room. But I think I know what you mean. Go ahead and make yourself at home.
Attic room, eh? Well... we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home.
Next to the door, the room on the left.
Teach them to stop paying me.
Here. You deserve a reward for your service.
What? No! No, you don't understand! There's been some kind of mistake! I... Aggghhh!
Well then, if you don't want the extra gold, you can certainly let Letrush keep it as a gesture of goodwill.
I'm not stealing anything. Besides, some jail time isn't going to make me roll over and play dead.

I bet we have rabbit again. I'm getting sick of rabbit.
We're running out of bread. I hope the supplies get here soon.
Aw, quit your bellyaching.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It's not that bad.
You'd rather be plowing a field? Not me.
Go tell the commander. I'm sure the boot in your arse will take your mind off your troubles.
You must be all right if you've got time to complain.
We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice.
You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain.
Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves.
We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you.
We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.
We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.
You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift.
But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen.
You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind.
Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age... that is not ours to know.
You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.
That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination.

Get out of here before I call the guards!
Both of you... out, out!

I'm sure Pavo would be grateful, and we'd all rest a little easier.
But that's nonsense. You can't handle a group of Forsworn by yourself. If their axes don't get you, their magic will.
I'd be grateful. Kolskeggr is my home.
But, I wouldn't go there if I were you. There's a whole group of them with axes and magic on their side. You'd never stand a chance.
We're going to need an army to clear out that crypt.
Fine, but there's a whole crypt of draugr underneath the mine.
We're not going in there until the Jarl's men come to clear them out, so I wouldn't go down there.
You're joking, right? Those bone-walkers will tear you limb from limb.
But if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead.
Good to hear.
They just call themselves the people of the Reach. Lot of common blood with the Bretons, by the looks of them.
Used to have their own kingdom, till the Nords came, now they're at the bottom of the hay pile.
The Empire is fortunate to have the support of the Thalmor during this difficult time, don't you think?
Mark my words, the war will be over in a matter of months. Once Ulfric sees the full might of the Empire, I'm sure he'll come to his senses.
I don't understand why General Tullius hasn't been recalled. The man is clearly incompetent. I have half a mind to tell him so myself.
Trust me, there's no place better to forge relationships with the movers and shakers of Skyrim.
I wasn't expecting to see you here! I assume you have your reasons. Everyone does.
Look around the room and you'll see what we're up against. Just between you and me, a lot of what Ulfric says about the Empire is true.
I swear Elenwen holds these parties just to make the Empire look bad. Almost makes me want to join the Stormcloaks.
The only reason I'm here is because my refusal to attend would cause a diplomatic incident.
Do I know you? I didn't think so.
Go ahead and play your joke.
I should be back in Windhelm. I've got work to do.
Did you know Vittoria is the Emperor's cousin? Best stay on her good side.
Did you know Vittoria's getting married? They say the Emperor might even come to Skyrim for the wedding!
calling across a crowded party
It's very nice to meet you. You'll have to excuse Orthus here. He so rarely gets back to civilization. Stuck in Windhelm, poor fellow.
Don't worry, Orthus. I'm doing my best to get you reassigned to Solitude.
stoutly
You think living with Grogmar is easy? Did you see how he lives?
You two will just have to learn to get along until we can build you another house.
At this rate that'll never happen.
Quit your bellyaching. We've all got our problems.
I've been cracking rock ever since I was able to hold a pickaxe and I'm telling you, this mine is drying up.
And I'm telling you, you're wrong.
What makes you so sure? What if I'm right?
I know there's ore still in there, I can smell it. If you think you're right then you can pack up and leave any time you like.
How are your parents faring, Grelka? Doing better than we are I would guess.
It's no feast in their neck of the woods either. Last time I was up there, father said they were barely scraping by.
This civil war is taking its toll on all of us. Miners are some of the hardest hit.
That's what scares me. I'm afraid I'll travel to Darkwater Crossing and find it burned to the ground.
All I'm asking is that you clean up once in a while. How you can find anything in your half of the place is beyond me.
I'd rather spend more time in the mine hauling up iron then doing woman's work keeping the house clean.
I'll have you know I can haul up just as much iron as you in a day and still manage to clean up my messes.
You think so, huh? Maybe you'd like to put some septims behind that boast.
You have yourself a bet.
Grelka, do you fancy a walk tomorrow?
Odfel, I've told you time and time again. I'm not interested in a relationship with you.
And why not? I'm handsome, strong and smart. What else could you possibly need?
I need someone that cares about me more than they care about themselves. That person isn't you.
I've been watching the way you mine and I have to say, I'm very impressed.
I owe it all to my father who started me swinging the pickaxe when I was a barefoot little girl.
Well, it shows. Your skill rivals some of the greatest miners I've known.
Thank you. It's nice to know someone admires me for more than just my appearance.
This is not the time to keep Astrid waiting.
It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.
Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood, and Astrid was just a [QUOTE]pretender.[QUOTE]

You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really.
But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all.
It may not be [QUOTE]official[QUOTE], but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on.
I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.
No, no. Goodness, no!
At least, I don't think so. No, it's just... It's just something I'd prefer to keep to myself.
Ah, yes. Umm, no. No, I don't think so. Not at this point.
It's just that, well I'm not even really sure it's going to amount to anything just yet. All theoretical right now, you understand.
But the implications are quite intriguing, I think. I simply need some experimental results to confirm my suspicions.
Just... Just bring me some Dwemer cogs. I need to examine them for the methods used in forging them.
Ten of them should be enough for me to get a better understanding of how they were crafted. That's all I need, all right?
Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research.
I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful...
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging.
Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know.
I simply need more pieces of Dwemer equipment to study. It's nothing dangerous... At least, not necessarily.
And please, let's just... Let's keep this between us.
As a matter of fact, there is something you can do for me.
What? Oh, no. No, no. I need more time to research the dwarven machinery. Thank you for offering, though.
I had retained Enthir's services in, uhh, acquiring something specific.
smug, emphasis on [QUOTE]mine[QUOTE]
amused, smug
I have a... friend, let's say, who's interested in a staff. A particular one.
It's nothing dangerous, so don't worry. I'm not even sure why he wants it, but then that's not really my concern. He's willing to pay for it.
The problem is that it'll be a little difficult to acquire, seeing as how it's in the hands of someone who isn't exactly friendly.
So, you bring that staff back here, and I'll consider it payment for the item Arniel was after.
Well, well.
All right, you delivered on your end, so I'll deliver on mine. Here's the gem Arniel was after.
Can't imagine what he expects to do with that... it's warped beyond any ability to capture a soul.
Wonderful. I was afraid I'd have to give up, and when I'm so close...
Thank you for this. I have a great deal of work ahead of me.
The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of.
Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... Mystery.

Lacking the heart of a dead god myself, I was attempting to substitute a rather specific soul gem. The ahh, the one you helped me acquire.
Well, yes. I mean, no. That is, it might, but I'm not completely sure. I'm no tonal architect, I've only read their writings. Scraps, really.
The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The dwarves had machines for this sort of thing.
I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwarven Convector.
It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.
thinking hard
Well, yes. The designs for my Convector were based on real dwarven machines, so there may still be some in existence.
I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations.
Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
It's very particular, and very important.
Well, I... Don't you see?
Unlocking this mystery... The story alone is worth more riches than you can even imagine.
And perhaps... well, I don't wish to speculate, but... What if we could contact the dwarves? What if they're still out there? Imagine!
Wonderful, just wonderful! I knew I could count on you!
Now this spell is not for defending yourself, but it's just right for heating the Convector. At least three seconds' burn is necessary.
Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors.
I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?
No, and at this rate, I never shall!
Enthir is once again holding out on me. He refuses to deliver yet another item absolutely essential to my work!
extremely agitated
I don't know, I don't know!
supremely annoyed
really, really annoyed
exasperated, slowly emphasize [QUOTE]I don't have it[QUOTE]
I... I don't understand. Where is it?
No, no no no. This can't be happening.
It can't be lost. It just can't! It's irreplaceable, do you understand?
Without it, I cannot finish my work. All these years, so much time, so much energy...
You must find it! It cannot end this way! Not after I've worked so hard!
It... It's very valuable. Critical to my work, and one-of-a-kind. That's all I care to say for now.
Have you lost your mind?
Think, please, just for a moment, about what he would do if he knew its true value.
Do you really believe he would honor our agreement, or go running off to the highest bidder?
Please, you must set this right. I'm begging you.
really annoyed
Last I heard he intended to pass through Eastmarch on his way here.
Last I'd heard, he was crossing the border from Morrowind into The Rift.
I heard one of them was just arrested trying to sneak into the city. If he's locked up in the jail, perhaps you can get it out of him.
Please, I know I'm asking you to do something difficult, maybe even dangerous. I just don't know who else I can trust.
You've seen them? Then waste no time, head there at once!
The longer they're around, the more danger I'm in! Please, kill Kematu and end this nightmare for me!
in a low, angry tone
Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.
I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!
with just an undertone of sarcasm
coldly, dismissively
gasp of shock and fear
Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing!
Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!
Yes, Madame Ambassador.
cheerfully
I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir.
I hope you're enjoying yourself, ma'am.
What can I get for you?
I trust that this is just the begining of a long and mutually beneficial relationship.
I'm so glad you could attend today.
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
Please, help yourself to more wine.
The hospitality of the Thalmor Embassy is at your service.
Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after.
I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur.
pleading
There's a likely-looking filly. Even if she is an elf.
You there! Serving girl! What's your name, dear?
very polite and deferential
No, no, that's not what I'm interested in right now.
I just wanted to get a better look at you. I like what I see, my dear.
And believe me, I don't say that to everyone. I'm very discriminating when it comes to the female form.

For the man who knows how to make money, war can be a most profitable venture.
The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.
Elenwen always throws quite a party. I never miss one if I can help it.
You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude.
sanctimoniously -- he believes not a word of this claptrap
jovially -- your new best friend
half-joking but not really
Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I spoke to her earlier.
Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.
Ha. We'll see. I do have my eye on her, but she seemed a bit cold when I spoke to her earlier. Maybe just playing hard to get, eh?
Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now.
with a leer
Lothario unleashed
in a low, angry voice
hesitant, confused, trying to remain polite
Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.
Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?
No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties.
raising his voice, calling across the room
Please, sir, leave me alone!
Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.
Trust me, we have nothing to say to one another.
Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.
I should have known this would end badly. I can't believe I let Delphine talk me into this.
Let's get out of here, for pity's sake!
I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.
We've got to get out of here.
You saved my life. I won't forget it. Look me up if you're ever in Riften.
You didn't have to help me, so... thanks.
paying a special agent his salary
Are you sure? It's rightfully yours, but this money could go to getting better weapons and armor, and making repairs to the settlements we control.
Did you clean the linens, yet?
I did. Those mead stains are always tricky.
Mama, where did papa go?
He's off fighting the war, dear. For the Stormcloaks.
Last time you said he was fighting for the Empire.
Yes. I'm sure he's doing well there.
Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe.
By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out.
If you want to go to the trouble, feel free. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free Alteration training when you get back.
It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for.
Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed.
Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do.
Suppose so. Got one all saddled if you've got the coin.
Not today. Sold my last one. Pretty sure I sold it to you.
Yeah, I got one for sale.
You could if I had one. Sold my last available horse to someone that looked an awful lot like you.
Got one all saddled and ready to go. What are you willing to pay?
If I had one. Sold my last one to you a bit ago.
Reckon you can. How much you willing to pay?
Nope. Sold my last one to some stranger.
It's for sale, if you've got the coin.
Not right now. You bought my last one.
That one with the saddle? How much are you offering?
Can't help you. They're all spoken for.
Don't mind if you do. What's your price?
If I had one you could. They're all spoken for.
I've got one all saddled up for you! What do you figure she's worth?
Wish I did, but some outlander bought my last one.
That's what I'm here for. What are you offering?
Don't have any that are for sale right now.
Yes! Yes, you can. She's all saddled up and everything.
Not today. You should have come by earlier. Wait, didn't I sell me last one to you?
You've got a deal. It's the one with the saddle.
Then come back when you've got that much.
That'll do. She's all saddled up for you.
When you get it, she's yours.
Sounds fair. She's yours. Like I said, she's all saddled.
When you got that much, we'll talk.
Fair enough. You can have her. She's the one with the saddle.
That's your best offer? I suppose so. She's the one with the saddle.
If you had it, you'd be riding and we wouldn't be talking.
That much? I mean, of course. If that's all you've got.
I'd sell her for that, but you ain't got it.
Sold. She's all yours. She's already saddled up.
That would work, except you ain't got.
Wish everyone haggled like you. She's all yours.
Too bad you don't have that much. Guess you'll have to walk.
Good enough for me. It's the one with the saddle.
That would be a fair price. When you've got it, come see me.
Wow! Didn't think I could get that for her. I mean, sure!
Looks like you're a little short on coin though. Sorry.
Don't blame me if your feet get sore.
Then stop wastin' my time.
Off with ya then. I've got work to do.
Didn't think you had the coin for it anyway.
Then off with ya. I've got better things to do.
Should have known you'd be a cheap one.
Then what are you wasting my time for?
Walkin' never hurt nobody. If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Oh. Was it something I said? I can't afford to lower the price, but come back if you change your mind.
So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?
Ah, you're back. Ready to try again, are we? Let's start from the top. You were sent to kill the Gourmet. And he is...
Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own.
All you've got to do is find and kill one lousy chef. The clock is ticking...
So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well.
You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid...
Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise.
You performed your duties to the letter.
Right, which we had already established. And you managed to hide the body as well? Good.
You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. So there's that. And Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.
Well, looks like you completed the contract as directed. Finally. A little sloppy, but, well... done is done.
Here's your gold, with a little extra for hiding the body. Now go see Astrid. The final stage of the contract has come. The Emperor must fall.
Good. And his Writ of Passage?
Oh wait, let me guess - you don't have them.
Fool! Amateur! Without those papers you'll never be able to present yourself as the Gourmet! Off with you! Back to the body to retrieve them!
Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage too, I see, so that's done.
But why? Why, pray tell, have I received word that Anton Virane is still walking around Markarth, hale and healthy as the day he was born?
Back to Markarth with you! Virane must be silenced! He's a potential witness, you witless dagger jabber!
Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that.
I've also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good.
But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle?
Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.
Look. I gave you a contract, and you completed it. Barely. Now let's go back to you being insufferable, and me being... me.
scream of fright, just saw a ghost (literally)
There's a... ghost. Just wandering around my inn like it owned the place.
Yes. I've heard stories that Old Hroldan was haunted, but no ones seen a ghost here since the Great War.
He's from the battle, I just know it. He's one of Tiber Septim's soldiers... back from the dead.
Hjalti? I've never heard of anyone named Hjalti. Tiber Septim had many names. Maybe that's one of them?
A sword? I remember a legend that Tiber Septim had attacked one of the enemy camps before he came to Old Hroldan. It could be there.
I'll mark it down on your map.
It's been an honor to serve you, brother.
Remembers our lessons from the sword masters of Alcaire? Let me show you a few things you may have forgotten before we leave Hroldan.
Mara have mercy that gave me a fright.
Do you think the ghost is one of... Tiber Septim's dead men?
All of a sudden, the ghost disappeared. What happened to it?
Do you think that ghost is coming back? It seems to have vanished.
I was just getting used to that ghost being here, and poof, now he's gone.
Hjalti? Is that you? I've been waiting.
I've been waiting for you. Hjalti.
I fought by your side. To take back the Reach from the savages.
Do you remember me now, Hjalti?
Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman!
Please. Please just let me be...
The... the Gourmet?
Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave.
The Dark Brotherhood?
Now... now wait a minute. Let's not get hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right?
Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn. That's all I know!
Now... now you'll let me go. Right?
Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way, then...
No. Oh, please no...
So... we're done?
shouted into a large room
Surrender immediately or you both die.
Never mind, I'm dead already-
Silence, traitor! Move. Slowly.
He's got to be here somewhere.
calling softly through a closed door
I wish you luck in finding the verse.
We should really get to court.
We should present the verse soon.
Don't forget to speak to Jorn when you're ready for the festival.
Be careful, you might find more than just King Olaf's Verse in Dead Man's Respite.
Best batch of Spiced Wine I ever had.
I thought the festival wasn't happening this year.
Thanks for convincing Elisif to put this on again.
Come on! Light the fire!
Jorn is the best of the bunch, you should hear him sing.
I heard you're the reason we get to have this.  Thank you.
I believe Sanguine would be pleased with this festival.
I like the pretty lights.
Burn the king!
You've done well by restoring our Festival.
Thank you so much. The festival has really increased my sales.
There's the man himself!
There's the woman herself!
Burn the King!
Congratulations on getting the festival restored.
Get your festival meat pie. Specially made.
Try our meats made here at the Festival. They're the best.
So nice to get this break from my cleaning duties.
You might as well have some sweets. I made them for the festival after all.
Great. Looks like you'll be one of us soon.  We'll gather outside the College for the Burning of King Olaf.
I'll tell everyone we're ready but we'll start the festival at dusk.
Come talk to me after dark, we'll get the festival started when you do.
I'll speak with Aela about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
I'll speak with Farkas about how you handled yourself. Come back later.
It's tough, with just the two of us.
There's hardly ever time to make the occasional delivery to the taverns of Skyrim.
We could use a pair of hands and a strong back. There'd be a little coin in it for you.
Indeed I do.
That'd be great. There's a case of our soon-to-be famous mead that needs to get to Winterhold. Get it there, and you can keep the delivery fee.
Ah, good. I've been waiting on that.
Here's the gold for it. Thanks.
I need you to take a case of mead to the Frozen Hearth in Winterhold. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
Another case of mead needs to find its way to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. The delivery fee is yours to keep.
Candlehearth Hall is running low on our famous mead. Can you drop off this case? The gold is yours, as always.
There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?
Quite so.
But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a [QUOTE]he.[QUOTE] Could be a woman for all we know.
Don't be so petulant!
In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see!
Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!
You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad.
I believe so. Therefore, you are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found.
Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him.
Loose ends and all that.
Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention?
As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place.
Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better.
Now off with you!
Who are you? What do you want?
Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were.
Here's your payment. And... a little something else, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly!
It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed [QUOTE]oomph.[QUOTE]
Now, you'd better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation.
You promised me, Hjalti. You promised that when we sacked Hroldan, you would make me your sworn brother.
And I've waited. Even after the enemies' arrows dug into my chest and their hammers crushed my bones. I've waited.
Give me your sword, Hjalti. That we may become brothers as you promised.
The most well known stronghold is Dushnikh Yal. Here, I'll mark it down for you.
The strongholds keep to themselves. Skyrim hasn't always been kind to the Orcs.
For an outsider like you to be accepted, an Orc would have to make you Blood-Kin, and send word to the chiefs.
Trust like that is not freely given.
Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Brother to the Orcs.
Gladly. By the Code of Malacath, I name you Blood-Sister to the Orcs.
No, no! This is the wrong way!
We need to go upstairs, that's where she is! That's where the books are!
Wait, what?
I thought I was going to help you!
Well yes, I did. And thank you so much for helping me.
But... I rather thought that if I were to help, I might... Well, I might be allowed to return to the College.
I'm not sure where else I'd go.
Are you quite sure? I don't want to get in the way, but...
I'm doing as you asked. Not for nothing, I hope?
I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.
amused at his predicament
See that disgusting drunk over there? A high-ranking official in the East Empire Company, believe it or not.
To maintain relationships.
By the way, I don't know who you are, but unless you want me to blow your cover, I'd advise that you avoid me for the rest of the party.
You have asked for my help. I am providing it.
The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.
It's only a matter of time before your whole rotten Empire collapses of its own decay. No offense.
None of these people cares a whit about the religious aspects of this war. Another sign of the degeneracy of your Empire.
At least Ulfric's men are willing to fight for their principles, barbaric as they may be.
It's a necessary part of my job to mix with the upper classes of Skyrim, such as they are.
There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy.
Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have now branded themselves traitors as well as heretics.
smiles thinly
Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know.
Yes, that's probably for the best. I really shouldn't risk getting on Elenwen's bad side.
Yes, this probably isn't really the place for your little jokes.
Thank you. I knew you'd understand.
I'll try to forget you ever asked.
Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.
This is neither the time nor place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.
Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?
Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.
muted moans of pain, groans -- someone who's been tortured
SILENCE - do not record
Let's begin again.
No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...
You know the rules.
screaming in pain (being tortured)
Start at the beginning, as usual.
If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...
No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything...
There's an old man. He lives in Riften.
He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.
And his name is...?
start with hacking coughing ... seriously tortured already
scream followed by heavy breathing/panting -- torture
You know the rules. Just answer the questions.
And where can we find this nameless old man?
Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure.
begin with a heavy sigh -- the torturer's work is never done
What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-
bubbling scream of pain followed by panting/gasping for breath
Silence, prisoner!
No idea, but whatever he did it must have angered Maven. No guard would lock up a Black-Briar without the old lady's permission.
Ah, and let me guess. He wants his horse. Well, that's going to be a bit of a problem. You see, I don't really outright [QUOTE]own[QUOTE] Frost...
emphasis on [QUOTE]that[QUOTE]
My plan was to take the horse from our lodge and deliver it to Letrush at the stables. Obviously, that didn't exactly work out as I'd planned...
emphasize [QUOTE]you[QUOTE] in last sentence.
Then I think we're done talking.
Welcome to the Bards College. I am the headmaster here. How may I help you?
I have faith that you'll return with King Olaf's Verse.
Ah, you have returned. How goes the task I gave you?
I still don't know if rewriting the verse is going to work.
I do hope the court likes the verse. I think we've done an excellent job of recreating it.
We should have the festival soon.
Good to meet a prospective Bard.
Get the coat. Then we'll talk.
Nice to meet the person who went to King Olaf's Tomb.
The Greybeards are a solitary lot. I don't think they've ever ventured outside their monastery.
We get the occasional pilgrim passing through here on their way to the summit, but almost all of them have returned disappointed.
I've been to the monastery many times, but I've never even laid eyes on one of the Greybeards. Not that I'd care to.
Being masters of the Thu'um, they could kill you by uttering a single word.
Well, not that they would. They seem peaceful, but I wouldn't want to provoke them.
Klimmek brings food supplies up to them once every few weeks when the weather permits it.
Other than that, they seem like a quiet lot. Don't really know too much about them.
It's frightening living below their monastery.
Sometimes I swear I can hear strange noises rolling down from up there. It sounds like thunder, but there's never any rain.
What do you make of that?
The Greybeards stay away from me, and I stay away from them. Suits me just fine.
Always thought it was odd that there's a layer of thick clouds covering the peak of the mountain above the monastery.
Not sure what's up there, but I bet the Greybeards know.
They call the path to the monastery the 7,000 Steps. Can you imagine?
I'm not certain if I could even make it to the top without collapsing from exhaustion.
The Greybeards are a strange bunch.
I heard they live their entire life without uttering a single word; can you even imagine?
wistful
sadness, but not revealing
I think you should continue with your performances.
sad... wistful
I think you play beautifully. It would be a shame if you stopped.
I think I saw it again. That... ghost. It was over by the barrows.
That thing's evil, Lynly! I told you to keep away from there!
I'm sorry. I was curious... I didn't believe the stories. I won't go over there ever again.
See that you don't. I promised to keep you safe and I'm not going to break my word.
Have you spoken to Fastred yet?
Klimmek is doing just fine. You should follow your heart.
Perhaps one day, but not today.
You heading up to High Hrothgar soon, Klimmek?
I wish I didn't have to. It's quite a difficult climb.
trying to make a joke
I know, but I don't want to let them down. I guess I better start thinking about it soon.
I thought you played wonderfully last night.
blushing
embarrassed, you are asking a woman you fancy on a first date
You're sweet. I'm just not ready for that sort of thing right now. I'm sorry.
I heard Temba yelling at you yesterday. Why do you let her treat you like that?
Perhaps, but abuse is abuse. I don't think I could stand it.
There's much more to worry about in life then a bit of a temper, my friend.
serious tone
What is it now?
Wilhelm said he saw you speaking to one of the pilgrims on the 7,000 Steps. I told you that I didn't want you to go up there.
I know what you said, but I only wanted to speak to him for a moment.
You have to let Fastred follow her heart. You can't tell her what to do.
She's our only child, Boti. Am I to throw her to the wolves?
And if she decides to leave Ivarstead, what then? No, no... I can't bear the thought.
annoyed but trying to be nice
very disappointed
We're behind again. I need you to catch another two bushels by week's end if I'm to make another delivery.
Come on, everyone in town knows that you spend more time with Fastred than fishing in the river.
That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.
If you have a moment, I've come up with a few ideas I wanted to share.
I'm becoming sick to death of your ideas. Not one of them has paid off since you moved in.
Look, I'm merely suggesting a few things that could expand our business.
accentuate [QUOTE]our[QUOTE]
As I remember things, it was you that showed up at my doorstep looking for a job and a place to live. Try and remember that.
Another batch of logs completely ruined. I swear, these bears have it out for me.
chipper, trying to be positive
When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. Otherwise, mind your business.
Gwilin! I told you to cut those boards at twice arm length! My arm's length. Not yours.
chipper, trying to maintain that composure
Sigh. Everyone isn't as short as you are... what good are these boards to someone of the proper height!?
Sorry, Miss Temba.
Still eager to please. This is good. Skjor may be right about you.
He has something special planned for you. Better talk to him.
Yes. I have something a little different planned this time.
But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight.
We will speak more.
Yes, I have something special for you.
Skjor was looking for you before. Talk to him before doing anything else.
You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken.
You are new here, are you not? We have not spoken.
I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold.
I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here.
But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College.
Are we clear?
Then allow me to introduce myself.
mildly amused
Not often, no.
Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths.
We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.
New here too, eh? It's good to see another Nord. I feared I'd be the only one.
Almost doesn't feel like Skyrim, being so far away from the rest of the world here.
New here too, eh? I'd hoped I wouldn't be the only Nord, but I should've known better.
No offense, of course.
Well, there's an Imbuer here in the Great Hall.
Well, there's an Imbuer in the Great Hall.
I'm sure you can figure it out on your own. If you can't, perhaps Urag has a book you can read.
My pleasure.
No. No I can't.
I have enough to keep me busy. View it as a chance to hone your craft.
In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams.
The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions.
The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.
you're a bit angry the player doesn't care
extremely sad player refused to help you
Mara be praised!
sense of urgency
Ah, pardon me, friend. I didn't see you standing there.
Allow me to introduce myself: Razelan. Imports and exports, by trade. Observer of human nature, by avocation.
Don't worry. I'll play my part.
I find these parties such a dreadful bore.
One thing everyone can agree on. This war is bad for business.
grumbling to himself
assuming you're going to help make someone else look foolish - which sounds great
Oh... all right. If it's so important to you, I suppose I can help.
Very well. I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fun.
he's joking with you
But I have nothing to hide. I'm in from the south, on business.
And if you want to do business in Tamriel these days, well, you'd better get used to cozying up to the Thalmor. Like it or not.
with good humor
Well... let's hear it.
My ears are always open to a friend's request.
Say on, friend. What do you need?
I'm always glad to help a friend if I can. What do you need?
Oh? Something interesting, I hope?
with a laugh - you're joking
I'm listening.
What is it, my friend?
The East Empire Company has interests all across Tamriel, inside and outside the Empire's borders. We try not to get involved in politics.
However, as the head of the company it's my job to make sure we maintain good relationships with prospective partners and investors.
conspiratorially - you're happy to help poke the Thalmor in the eye
doubtfully
I don't even want to know, do I? But for you... all right. I'll do it.
This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?
with a smile
in a low confidential tone
Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!
Ulfric Stormcloak? The rightful High King? That's bordering on treason, man! Stand up. Stand up, I say!
shocked and offended (faking - could be overacted)
quietly, under your breath to someone very nearby - venomously
Well, I don't think you should stay things like that about the Ambassador!
quietly, under her breath to someone very nearby
How dare you! You disgusting pig!
You've got a lot of nerve, suggesting something like that, to me of all people! If this was Riften, I'd have you thrown in the dungeon!
How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!
You take it back then? You retract your statement? Well?
Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more!
Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!
There's no excuse for your behavior!
You behave like you're carousing in a house of ill repute, not the residence of the Thalmor Ambassador!
loudly
The head office will hear of this, Razelan! You're a disgrace to the East Empire Company, and to the Empire itself!
You're a disgrace to the Empire. To think that you're actually the representative of the East Empire Company.
When people talk about the decadent, tottering Empire, it's people like you they have in mind!
Your insults and provocations have gone far enough!
I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.
Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time.
Razelan. What is it this time?
Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.
Tell your men to stand down. I don't need any help dealing with this kind of fool. He isn't worth the trouble.
a bit sarcastically
Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go.
Oh... I'm afraid I may have overreacted. Please, I've already forgotten whatever it was he said to me.
brightly
I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account.
Oh, Ambassador Elenwen, that won't be necessary. It is just Razelan, after all.
I'm sure he'll behave himself for the rest of the evening, won't you dear?
Well, now. There's no need to ruin the party on my account. I don't think he'll be bothering me again.

That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What... I don't understand why everyone... never mind.
Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent.
Well I'm glad you were there. I don't know how I would have gotten past the Forsworn without you.
Thank the Divines we survived that.
Those Forsworn were fierce fighters. Fiercer than I could have imagined.
Do you think the Forsworn will come here? I mean, if they attacked Kolskeggr....
Let's just hope that doesn't happen.
That I do. If you want to grab a pickaxe and dig up some iron, feel free. I'll pay for anything you bring me.
Skaggi is in charge, not me.
That it is. Good to be home. Let me know if you dig up any ore. We'll pay a fair wage.
Seems Kolskeggr Mine got hit by Forsworn. Those madmen get more bold every season.
Pavo and Gat are the only survivors. I'll be sending word to the Jarl about this, but I don't know when help will come.
Was. Forsworn came in the night. Killed everyone. Gat and I are the only ones who escaped.
Hopefully Skaggi will send word to the Jarl and something will be done.

What kind of question is that? Look at me! Is this a young man's face?
I've been here 50 years, and nothing is going to move me off my land.
What've you been staring at your feet this whole time? You see that big city up ahead of you? Markarth?
Head over there, unless you feel like helping my wife pick crops. And then 50 years later you'll wake up and still be here.
Oh my. That...
You... you go first.
speaking to his executioner
That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them.
With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword.
If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the hills.

Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords... but, I've come to respect them.

The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace.
There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people... but they are few in number.
The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home.
passionate
darkly
Soon, the elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to fight them.
with great passion
Peace? When has any Nord ever known peace? Skyrim breeds warriors. It's who we are, it's in our blood.
It's only a matter of time before their pointy ears start itching to rule the world again.
Ignore me all you want, you still aren't getting in.
Oh, my mistake then. Sorry, you can go on ahead.
Sure, and I'm Queen Barenziah. Now tell me another one.
Sure, that'll do just fine. Go on ahead.
That's just insulting. Not even a proper bribe?
Bloody tourists.
Forgive me milord, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.
Forgive me milady, I didn't recognize you! Please proceed.
Bah, I'm not afraid of anything out here. Walls are just a weakling's hiding spot.
Now me, I'm no weakling. In fact, I bet I've got the strongest arms in all of Skyrim.
Oh! Sounds like I've got a challenger.
Tell you what. How about a friendly wager, just between us. I bet you my entire purse of septims I can beat you in a fistfight.
You match the bet and we fight until one of us gives in.
All right, remember... this is a clean fight. No weapons, no tricks. And none of those fancy magic spells, either.
Here we go!
Well come back when you earn some more so I can take it from you!
I don't blame you. If I were in your shoes, I'd chicken out too.
Well, offer still stands if you ever want to have a go.
Sure, I don't mind taking some more of your gold.
Just let me know when you're ready.
I'll fight you again, but not until you have the gold to back up your bet.
Suit yourself. I'm always here.
Well done! Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.
Allow me to present you with this compensation for your selfless efforts.
say this with a wink... she's devious
Here, this should suffice as your cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions. Now, if you'll excuse me...
I told you everything I know. What else did you want?
You looking for something?
I thank you for your help, my friend.
I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.
Be careful, Niluva is a bit... aggressive when she's cornered.
Ah, there you are. I was wondering when you'd visit us again.
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; several of our citizens have expressed their admiration.
So, I've been hearing your name in court quite a bit lately.
I've been informed by my steward that you've made quite an impression in the Rift; the people won't stop blathering about you.
Much like Mjoll, you've become champion of our hold; helping people with their difficulties and providing assistance for their needs.
As the Jarl of Riften, I feel it's my duty to honor your selfless behavior by honoring you with the title Thane of Riften.
Oh don't pretend to be modest. I'm talking about your new role as champion. Apparently, you've taken my people under your wing.
If you think you can steal my throne by winning the hearts of the people, that's where you're wrong. Keep that in mind.
However, since it wouldn't behoove me to make you disappear, I'd rather have you on my side as Thane of Riften.
I should be the one thanking you. You've solved more problems in the short time you've been here then anyone in my court has their entire careers.
You've been a beacon of hope in these dark times for my people and I will never forget it.
Therefore, by my authority as Jarl, I pronounce you Thane of Riften and award you all of the benefits befitting your station. Congratulations.
I expect that you'll distance yourself from the affairs of state. In other words, keep your nose out of my business and we'll do just fine.
Just remember that you're only a part of my court, this doesn't make you one of the family.
last line sort of to self aloud
Doesn't matter... the title is yours. I henceforth name you Thane of Riften. Don't disappoint me.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be meeting Malborn in Solitude.
Not here. I told you to meet me in Riverwood.
in an undertone, trying not to be overheard
What can I get for you, sir?
What can I get for you, ma'am?
Yes? What do you need?
You've already taken all the necessary steps in becoming eligible for the title.
Therefore all that remains is to bestow it upon you.
You damn well better.
I've checked with my court and apparently you're fully eligible... there's nothing standing in the way of presenting you the title.
Before I can present you with the title, there's but a single requirement you must fulfill.
A Thane of Riften is expected to maintain permanent residence within the city walls.
My steward has such a home available to you for purchase. I think you'll find the accommodations to be most pleasing.
When the house is yours, return to me and I will present you the title.
Not so fast, there's a matter of residence to be discussed.
In order to have the title bestowed upon you, you need to purchase a house within Riften.
mock elation
After the place is yours, come back to me and we'll deal with the rest of the nonsense.
Then allow me to officially welcome you to Riften. You'll make a fine addition to our city.
All that remains now is to bestow the title upon you.
Hmm? What's this about?
Oh, yes. Of course... the whole thane thing. I'd forgotten. If you're ready then, can we get this out of the way?

Arnleif and Sons Trading Company. I'm a porter. Just some muscle hired to move heavy packages.
But we don't get any shipments in. Forsworn attack every caravan. So all I do is sit here and drink.
That's right. Welcome to Markarth, traveler. Thank the Divines you can choose to live somewhere else.
How are you today, Thaena?
Same as ever. Trying to keep from freezing to death, trying to keep food on the table.
Always looking on the bright side, aren't you.
You got anything in here worth buying?
I certainly hope so, otherwise I'm wasting my time.
Yeah, well I don't see anything.
You looking for anything in particular this time?
Perhaps, perhaps. I'm not quite sure what I need.
Well, you know the drill. You don't see it here, it's gonna cost you extra for me to get it.
I'm fully aware of the terms of our... arrangement.
Have you gotten the items I requested from you?
Not yet. You know you're asking for some pretty strange stuff, don't you? It's not easy to find.
You assured me that you could find it, however.
I did, and I will. It's just tougher than I thought.
I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit.
Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.
Seemed like the best way to see the world and make some coin.
Sure I'm a little green, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in courage.
Well, if you change your mind, I'd still like your help.
Did you reconsider? Will you talk to my father?
Well, not exactly.
Listen, we're friends, right?
I wondered if I could ask a favor of you.
It's about Ranmir.
Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind.
Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with him being here all the time. He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay.
I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean.
Ah. Well, some other time, perhaps.
Oh, he was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love.
Well, I'm getting to that. Just let me explain.
See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought.
One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind.
He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.
I'm not sure. I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together.
I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could.
I don't, I'm afraid. Ranmir didn't talk much about her after she'd left.
He seemed convinced that she'd run off with someone named Vex. That's all I remember.
Who's asking?
Well, ain't gonna find her here. Haven't seen her in a while.
Not him again.
He came nosing around Riften a while back, making a lot of noise about me. He was... persuaded to leave before he found me.
Funny, I'd have thought she would've gone back to him by now.
She came through a while ago, wanted to know where she could get her hands on something valuable. Anything, really.
I told her it was a bad idea, that she wasn't cut out for what'd be necessary, but she wouldn't hear it.
So I gave her some advice, pointed her towards Hobs Fall Cave and that was that.
Like I told you, last time I saw her she was headed for Hobs Fall Cave. No idea what happened to her.
Don't you... Don't you say that name to me.
Don't you dare. Ever.
bitter, disbelieving

Unless it's gold for another round of drinks, I don't wanna hear it.
A what?
Don't you go pulling my leg. Give it here.
This... This is really from her, isn't it?
Did she really run off and do this? For me?
By the Eight. She's dead, isn't she? And it's all my fault.
I... I have some thinking to do. Thank you for this.
Please, leave me alone. I need to be by myself.
Yes. The finest court in all of High Rock. You think politics here are something? Well, we Bretons invented politics.
That is where I learned to cook, and where I belong. Not here, with all these dogs.
Very well, you may approach the Mournful Throne, but watch your words.
Nothing to say. Fine, but I'm watching you.
I don't know you, and I don't sell what precious property we have to outsiders.
But if you're willing to work, and you prove to be reliable, I might deem you worthy to live here. My steward will handle things from there.
My Jarl, we need to discuss the Forsworn.
The only thing we need to discuss is how many men it'll take to flush them out of the hills.
It's not that simple, Igmund. There are reports of Forsworn here in the city.
It doesn't matter if they're in the city. We fight them where they live, we won't have to fight them here.
They live here too, my Jarl. That's what I'm telling you.
I don't blame you.
All right, let's give this a try. Ready your ward...
This is a shame.
Always sad when someone has to die.
Another one. Terrible.
Large diagonal cut from left shoulder...
Hey, you. Get over here, I want to talk to you.
You can pretend not to hear me all you want... but you better stay out of the Black-Briars' business.
Then we're speakin' the same language. Good.
All right, all right, let's not get too hasty now.
Ha ha! Don't make me laugh.
Just stay out of the Black-Briars' affairs. You'll live longer.
I'll be at the docks if you change your mind.
Yeah, walk away like a good doggie. Just stay out of the Black-Briars' business and maybe we'll give you a bone.
Dirge told me you made it into the Guild. You need dirt on anything, you talk to me.
What did you want to know?
Back again? What is it this time?
You want to talk? Finish those jobs for Brynjolf first.
Get in good with Brynjolf, then we'll talk.
Stay out of the Black-Briars' business and you'll live longer.
You aren't worth my time. Piss off.
I'm through with you. Get out of my way.
What did you want?
Slip up and I'll gut you like a fish.
Be seein' you around.
Well, you got Maven, she pretty much runs the whole operation. She's got friends in high places if you know what I mean.
She's also got ties to the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, so basically no one can touch her.
Just remember, if she tells you to do somethin'... you damn well better do exactly what she says.
You kiddin'? My brother Dirge works in their hideout.
I used to run with them myself, but took a job with Maven after they started hittin' a rough patch.
If you want to get in on that action, find Brynjolf in the marketplace. I'm sure he could use someone like you.
Don't have to tell me twice. But then, I'm not the one that buried iron under these mountains.
You liar!
How could you do that to me!
You could have warned me you were baiting me into a trap.
But you're right. This should scatter the rest of them. I can go back to my life for now.
You have my thanks.
A risky game to play, friend.
But now Kematu's gone, and the rest of his snakes should slither back to their desert.
I can go back to my life for now.
And I have you to thank for it. I won't forget this.
Svana, I heard that Sibbi was put in jail. What happened?
They say... well, they say he murdered someone. Something to do with Svidi.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Svidi in a while. Wait... he didn't...
No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding now. Somewhere far from here I'd suspect.
If he wasn't a Black-Briar, I'd march right over to the jail and teach Sibbi some manners... but then I suppose I'd end up like Wulfur.
Madesi, why don't you just take a bed here? There's no need to sleep in Beggar's Row.
The cold stone, the dampness... it suits me, Svana.
Are you sure that's the real reason? It wouldn't have anything to do with others making an Argonian unwelcome, because if it is...
You have a kind heart; much too kind for Riften. Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine.
Hey, greenskin... close your mouth. Some of us are trying to eat over here.
There's no need to be rude, Grelka. If you don't care for Argonians, then perhaps you should take residence somewhere else.
Or perhaps you should crawl back into whatever swamp you came from, lizard man.
You're not going to goad me into a fight so I'll get kicked out, Grelka. Eat your food and leave me in peace.
I can't take it anymore, Tythis. Indaryn keeps pushing me around and I'm not even doing anything wrong.
Maybe it's time you quit then.
And do what? Losing a job from the Black-Briar family would make me a marked man. No one would ever take me on anywhere else.
Don't let it get you down. Indaryn will eventually tire of picking on you and move on to someone else.
No, and before you ask, it's not for sale.
I'm just protecting Bryling's investment. She's the owner, even though we're the ones here doing all the work.
She's already come down hard on us for missing shipments. Likely to do it again, since we're late.
Well, no.
But that's not the point.
Bryling owns the mine, and she's not selling. We make her some decent coin running this place. Keeps her living well in Solitude.
At least, when we can get shipments to her. We're late on the last one. I expect her to start breathin' fire any moment now.
You could take word to her that there'll be a shipment soon. Buy us some time and keep her off our backs.
In exchange, I'm willing to let a few ingots go missing. Maybe more than a few.
Can't do that and keep an eye on things here at the same time.
But... You could take word to her in Solitude, let her know it'll be coming soon.
I'd make it worth your while. No one would notice a few missing ingots out of the next shipment.
You're doing me quite a favor. I won't forget it.
I'm sure she'll be angry. Brace yourself.
Won't be 'some other time' at this rate.
Is everything all right? I've not heard from Sorli or Pactur in some time.
That's good news. I was starting to fear something had happened.
He's the real head of this family. He may not be the eldest, but all the work that keeps us respected is handled by my Thonar.
We're the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion. Saviors of Mer. Victors of the Great War.
The Empire exists because we allow it to exist, and I'm here to make sure the Jarl of Markarth remembers that.
As if this craggy, wretch of a city could give birth to a superiorly bred Mer such as myself. No, I'm not from Markarth.
I was sent here to lead the Thalmor's interests in this corner of Skyrim. It's my mission to root out all Talos worship in this city.
It's a religious matter. The Thalmor do not recognize Talos as a god. He was only a man, and does not deserve to a place in our pantheon.
The Empire has agreed to accept our beliefs, and its citizens have a responsibility to cease their heretical worship.
You're awfully inquisitive, aren't you? I like that. Perhaps you'd care to solve a little problem I'm having?
Ah, there we have it. This will be all I need to have Ogmund taken care of.
I would like to personally thank you on behalf of myself and the Thalmor for your assistance. Here, for your work.
Ogmund the skald. He's old, respected, and I know for a fact that he worships Talos in his home.
But the Jarl has been hesitant to call for his arrest. I want you to break in to his home and find evidence.
Hmph. Fine.
The Thalmor saved all of Elven-kind during the Oblivion Crisis. We've been watching over our lands for 200 years.
We re-founded the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance between us and our Bosmer cousins. You might know them from their common name. Wood elves.
We intend to prove the superiority of Mer over Man, one century at a time.
Damn Elves! You'll pay for this!
Praise Talos!
No. I'm a Breton from High Rock, and I refuse to be mistaken for a filthy native.
I don't care if we share the same ancestors, these people are savages. Half of them are Forsworn barbarians, and have you seen what they eat?
What have I done for the gods to take me so far from my beloved Daggerfall?
Good. I'd prefer using water to cool my metal, but it's what the Jarl wants.
Here. Some of my best armor. Wear it well.
Anything. Served in the Legion with my sister, Ghorza, for over 10 years. We've seen every piece you can imagine.
Have you met her? She runs the forge near the smelter. Just don't bother talking to her apprentice. Boy has no talent.
Depends on what you need. A light armor is good for travel. Less to carry. A heavy armor weighs you down, but no true warrior goes without it.
If you want some heavy armor, I might have a deal we could work out. I need a Daedra's Heart. Jarl wants me to cool his new sword in blood.
You get me a heart, I get you some armor. Interested?
shocked at unexpected betrayal
Ugh... damn thing.
Just... stay back.
Back off.
Can't trust these things.
No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of.
Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation.
Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense.
Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful.
But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option.
Have you found something?
Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?
The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for?
Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now.
Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's... one of us.
Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right.
And then, send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible.
Please. You first. I insist.
I just need to rest a moment, right here on this lovely rock.
Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold.
Stand back and watch a true professional wreck a party.
My friend! A toast to a beautiful friendship!
This is slow, methodical clapping. As if he's being sarcastic.
That man was, by far, the most insufferable decoy the Emperor has ever employed. I'm glad he's dead. Ah, but I'm even happier that you killed him.
Does a [QUOTE]tsk tsk tsk[QUOTE] after he says it
Surprised? So was I, when a member of your [QUOTE]Family[QUOTE] came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange.
I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence.
emphasis on the [QUOTE]and[QUOTE] - gets more and more angry as he speaks
Your Sanctuary's being put to the sword right now. That's what I think of this [QUOTE]deal.[QUOTE] You killed my son! All of you! And now you'll pay the price.
He's calmed down, and is now cold, and calculating.
But aren't even you the least bit nervous? After everything that's happened?
Quite. Yet that recent business with the young officer. Maro, was it? How dreadful. The son of your commander, plotting your assassination.
Yes, an unfortunate turn of events, that. But an isolated incident. And I have been assured that the fault was with the man's son alone.
You mean the wedding? My cousin's apparent murder? An unfortunate misunderstanding, no more. Cold mead, hot tempers... these things happen.
Truth is, we are in no danger whatsoever. Killing an Emperor can be useful, but befriending one? Now that's beneficial - as I'm sure you'd all agree.
Here we are. Gods, I'm nervous. We'll go in in just a moment. Please, I'll serve. You just stand there and... be amazing.
serious and joking at the same time - laughs at the end
serious and joking in an aristocratic sort of way - laughs after he says it

By the gods! The Gourmet has killed the Emperor! Attack!
By the gods! The Gourmet and the chef have poisoned the Emperor! Get them!
Looking for work?
Good day, Grelka.
What's so good about it? I've got deadbeats who don't pay me, the city guard looking over my shoulder and Maven Black-Briar breathing down my neck.
You poor thing. You should come by the temple, speak to Maramal.
angered... increases as you say this
Grelka, have you had anyone come by and try to sell you an iron war axe?
Not lately. Why?
trying to be pleasant
Oh I get it. [QUOTE]It's missing so Grelka must have it.[QUOTE] I wish this town would stop pointing their fingers at me.
Oh, Haelga... there you are. Your special order from Hammerfell came in off the last Khajiit caravan.
Oh, good. I wanted to try that out as soon as possible.
Try it out? What would you need a leather harness for anyway?
It's a religious thing.
What's this nonsense I've been hearing? How dare you call Bolli a deadbeat!
If he paid what he owes, I wouldn't have to say anything. Besides, what in Oblivion do you care?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh come off it, Niv. We both know you married that fisherman for his gold. You don't need to put on an act for my benefit.
Grelka, can you repair boots?
Leather? If they're armored, you should talk to Balimund over at The Scorched Hammer.
a bit embarrassed
Why in goodness name would you have... oh never mind, just bring them by my house later and I'll see what I can do.
I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild seems to be back to its old tricks again.
Did something happen at the Pawned Prawn?
One of them came in and demanded payment. Bolli tried to tell them no; stood up to them, but...
Just when you think things couldn't get any worse.
I don't like being made a fool of, Brand-Shei. Not one bit.
Maven, please. I didn't know it was your man. Had I known, I would have looked the other way, I swear.
Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined Mjoll as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.
Maven, I... please, don't hurt me.
Brand-Shei, do you think you can find me some theilul?
The Argonian sugar-cane wine? It's pretty hard to get around here. Very expensive.
That's fine. I have a special occasion coming up, and I'd like to have it.
I'll see what I can do.
Brand-Shei, did you hear about Helgen? It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!
Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know.
Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?
I don't know. All we can do is hope the Eight will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from Riften.
very shy
small giggle at end
shy, asking for a date
Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to.
I have two more bushels for you, Marise. That should keep you well-stocked.
Sounds good. May I owe you for them?
Say, how are you going to sell all those fish before they spoil?
You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know.
Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.
Feel free to ask me anything you like.
There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?
Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now.
Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we?
Someone bring me a drink, quick!
Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make!
I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress!
I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than that someone would actually want her in their bed.
Although... most of you are already in bed with her! But again... I speak figuratively, of course!
icy cold calm, dangerous, softly
heavy sigh of disgust
You have strong arms. You'd make a good Orc.
Um... thank you, Lash. You'd... make a fine Nord?
Don't say words you don't mean.
When are those Silver-Blood men going to leave?
Never. They've shut us down forever, Enmon. The Divines have abandoned us.
We're doomed. The mine is going to stay closed, and we'll up be carted of to Cidhna Mine as slaves.
Only criminals get sent to Cidhna Mine. They're not going to send us there.
Oh, they'll find some way to send us there. It'll be just my luck.
But why did they take her? What could they want with our little girl?
I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon.
You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?
Are you all right, dear?
The house is so... empty, Enmon... and quiet.
Are you all right, dear? I thought I saw a tear in your eye a moment ago.
Oh, I'm fine, Enmon. I just... I still miss her.
I miss her, too, but I'm glad she's safe.
So am I. I hope she's happy at the temple.
Enmon, dear, do you have any regrets? About letting her go?
No... no, we did the right thing. The temple will take good care of her, and one day she'll be helping all of Skyrim.
You're right. She'll be a great Sybil, won't she?
Of course she will. She's our daughter, after all.
I've been thinking, would you like to join me in hunting?
You want me to hunt with you? I thought you preferred being alone.
Your arms and legs are fit for catching strong, agile prey. I could use your help.
I'd be honored, but I have work to do in the mines.
When will Sanuarach Mine be open?
I don't know. Whenever those Silver-Blood men decide to leave.
I haven't seen you hunting in a while.
I can afford to buy meat now. I prefer working in the mines, anyway.
Tell me, Ragnar, what do you think of the Orcs?
Cunning warriors and skilled workers. It's good to have you here, Lash.
I asked what you thought of the Orcs, not about me.
Oh. I'm sorry. Well, it's good to have you here, anyway.
Damn Nords. Always getting in the way of us honest folk.
What did you say? You lazy coward, I'll cut your throat.
Nothing, Ragnar. Please... don't hurt me.
I... I'm sorry, Belchimac. I didn't mean that.
You're always talking about the Forsworn. You aren't thinking of joining them, are you?
Maybe I will. What do you think about that?
I'm warning you. Those people are killers. You'd never last a day with them.
I don't like bunking with Orcs. It's not... clean.
If you want me to leave, you could challenge me to a fight. I promise to stop once you've lost an arm.
What I meant to say was... I love having an Orc here in the barracks. They're so... pleasant.
Why do your people claim the Reach is theirs? The Orcs have been in these lands just as long.
You wouldn't understand, Lash. Your people aren't smart enough for politics.
Is that so? I'll remember that next time we're in the mine tunnels... alone.
Did... did I say you weren't smart? I meant to say that I'm not smart, Lash. I'm just not smart enough to answer your questions.
No, no... not at all. Mara believes that the spark of a union comes from inside us, not from our appearance.
Tell you what... if you still feel unsure, come by the temple sometime and we'll talk about it.
Marise, I've come to warn you that the Thieves Guild has been harassing shopkeepers again.
I've heard. Bolli and Keerava were speaking of it just a little while ago.
I hope that doesn't mean things are going to get worse around here.
Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.
What is it, Drifa? What's the matter?
It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind.
If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry.
Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, Shadr?
Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said.
Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you.
Hello Bolli. How's the fishing?
Bountiful. Although I would like to have anchored a bit closer to Goldenglow Estate.
Why didn't you then?
When I got close, the mercenaries Aringoth hired to protect the estate just waved me off. I don't think he wants visitors anymore.
Nivenor, my darling. What a pleasant surprise.
Oh! Bolli... yes, hello.
Will we be dining together this evening after my work at the fishery?
Sigh. Yes, as usual. I'll be there.
So, Tythis... you coming by the Bunkhouse later?
Of course. I rented a bed there. Where else would I sleep?
sultry
I want you sellswords out of my mine.
Watch your tongue, native. We'll leave when we're sure there's no Forsworn here.
Oh, and when would that be, I wonder? When I sell my land to the Silver-Bloods?
The Silver-Bloods have made you a very generous offer for this pile of dirt. I suggest you take it.
Robbery is what it is. The Silver-Bloods are trying to muscle in on my land.
Forsworn attack the mines, and suddenly all these sellswords show up to [QUOTE]help.[QUOTE] They won't let anyone work until I sell it off.
No. This is my land. You expect me to just hand it over to those Silver-Blood thugs?
Forsworn attacked a while back. Jarl had no men to spare, so the Silver-Bloods generously offered to send us to clean things up.
We just want that old native to hand over his land in payment for our services. Then we'll leave, and everyone can get back to work.
Helping out Ainethach, huh? Give me a reason not to plunge a dagger in your chest.
A family of thieves. Running their corrupt empire from Markarth.
The Silver-Blood family own half the Reach, and they won't stop until they own all of it.
You haven't heard of the Silver-Blood family? They're the most important people in the Reach.
They practically own the city of Markarth. And we're here on their coin.
That won't be the last we hear from the Silver-Bloods, but at least we can get back to work.
Thank you. You've done a good thing for me and my workers. Here. This is for you.
Good, that must be very comfortable for you. I think mine's a bit too small. Perhaps we could trade?
Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time.
If you ever try and [QUOTE]practice the Dibellan arts[QUOTE] with Hemming again, I'll make sure that pretty little face loses its beauty.
He wasn't protesting, Maven.
Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?
Well, there's Ingun Black-Briar, Maven's daughter. Strange girl. She likes to spend time down in Elgrim's Elixirs working on her alchemy.
Then you have Hemming, Maven's son; spoiled brat and heir to her empire. He follows her word like a loyal dog follows its master.
And finally, Sibbi; the worst of all of them. He's in Riften Jail for murder.
Wait... you mean I should just... tell her? Tell her how I feel?
If that's what she wants, then that's what she'll get.
There is one... Yngvar. He's quite popular with the ladies.
Thankfully Faleen is not quite his type, but they've been friends for some time, and he may have some ideas.
Please, ask him what she likes. It's my only chance.
I'm sure you've noticed that Winterhold isn't exactly overflowing with people.
So I'll sell whatever I can. If it's worth putting a price on, you can bet I'll do it.
I've been burned a few times, made a few bad deals, but mostly I come out on top.
Yeah, it was stupid of me.
I shouldn't have believed the story and just refused the trade. But I didn't, and now I'm stuck with this worthless junk.
Some line about this claw thing and Yngol Barrow. He said it was worth more than its weight in gold if I took it back there.
Something about placing it back in Yngol's chamber, I don't know.
What was I thinking? Even if it were true, I'm not setting foot in some ancient tomb, filled with who knows what.
I don't even care any more. You want to check it out? Fine. I'll sell you the thing for fifty gold, and then it's your problem.
Fine, here you go.
You get killed on account of this thing, it's not my fault. Got it?
But, I suppose, if it does actually turn out to be worth something, let me know, will you?
Oh, I'd gladly sell it to you if you had the money.
But you don't, do you?
I told you, I know everything about this castle.
For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard.
How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you.
Excellent work.
Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know.
It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal.
Everyone in town knows about the Black Door, and to never go near it.
Whatever you do, stay away from that Black Door. Being near it chills you to the bones.
Did you hear? People have been seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Divines have mercy.
I've heard that shadowy figures are being seen coming in and out of the Black Door. Gods help us.
You there! As an officer of the Imperial Legion, I require your assistance to complete my mission.
You there, hold! If you are a true friend to Skyrim, you will help me in my mission.
Are you going to help me with my mission? I need someone very capable.
My coat? What do you need my coat for?
What?! This is exactly why... don't they understand it's hard enough to fight a war without these juvenile attempts to undermine authority?
If you say so. If this were anyone but you I would lock them up.
Take it. Take the coat, have your fun. I'll see you at the festival.

You're passing through Solitude? Maybe you're looking to make some easy gold, yes?
With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters.
We have an interest in one of those boats, the Icerunner.
The Solitude Lighthouse will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the Icerunner would run aground.
No time to talk. Snitch or double-cross me and I'll kill you. I mean it!
emphasis on [QUOTE]were[QUOTE]
Yes, if someone were to put out the Lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot.
Ha! I'm afraid the loot's already been moved. You've been useful to the Blackbloods, though. You've earned a quick death.

I think we're almost out. Come on!
whispered
I hate those things. Too many eyes or something.
Looks like we're on our own now.
Since nobody's trying to kill me just now, maybe we should rest for a minute.
Let's see if we can find a way out of here.
We'd better stick together down here.
I'm glad to be out of that place. I hope this leads somewhere.
These bastards call themselves Imperial Legionnaires...
Come on. Sounds like trouble.
Look around. Grab anything that looks useful.
There may be a way out, down this way.
I guess that'll teach me to try to reason with a Stormcloak.
Let's see where this goes. We can't be the only survivors.
Find yourself a weapon. You're going to need it.
We'd better get out of here. I don't think this place is going to stand up to much more of this.
Don't worry. We'll get out of here, somehow.
I can't decide if things are about to get worse or better.
At least we don't have a dragon to worry about, for the moment.
Biggest damn spiders I've ever seen.
The others'll have to find another way out.
wearily
I sure hope there's a way out somewhere down here.
Here's the noble Empire in all its glory. Pah.
Look around. Grab anything useful.
We'd better get moving before any more Imperials show up.
Let's see where this goes. Better than going back outside with that dragon.
Get yourself a weapon. I'm going to need your help if we run into any more Imperials.
We've got to find a way out of here.
Better in here than out there.
Help us and you may earn a pardon.
Hey, weren't you on the carts with the Stormcloaks?
with a shrug - not your problem
I saw Caius.. that dragon just grabbed him and... I don't know how I made it out of there...
Nothing for it but to keep moving.
Better down here than out there.
A dragon.... First in a thousand years....
We need to find a way out of here.
Worry about yourself.
Thank Talos you came along... I thought I was going to die down here.
Imperial dogs... there's nothing that's too low for them.
You were with us on the carts, weren't you? Not your lucky day, eh?
I wonder if there's any more Imperials hiding down here somewhere.
Ralof seems to like you. That's good enough for me.
What do you make of it... the dragon? What does it mean?
What next?
I hope someone knows where we're going.
There are all sorts of people wandering around carryin' their valuables on their person... just waitin' for someone like you to pick their pocket.
Sure, I've got a mark for you. Stole something quite important from a friend of the Guild and we take care of our own. You in?
One of our marks seems to have an item of value we want to add to our vault. Get it for us and you'll receive the usual pay. Sound good?
Got ourselves a freelancer thinks he can muscle in on our territory. How about you teach him some manners, eh?
Maven wants this mark's most prized possession. The bloody fool carries it on his person all the time. So, think you can handle it?
Brynjolf want's this mark's head on a pike, but we'll settle for what the bastard's carryin' instead. Can I count on you?
Got a mark taxed with carryin' a heavy item. Care to lighten' the load?
This brilliant soul decided to pick a fight with a fellow Guild mate. Time for them to pay the piper. Will you help out?
I've got a mark who just got an item from a relative outside of Skyrim. They probably should have been quieter about it. You in?
Most of the establishments in Skyrim keep their transactions recorded within business ledgers.
Your job would be to change the numbers in those books so the shortfalls from our other jobs look legit.
This business is a regular target for the Guild. They keep pretty shoddy records, so the job should be a cinch. You in?
We want to waylay a shipment on the way from this business without them even noticin' anything went missin'. Want the job?
Yeah, sure. Got a business on tap that could use a little number rearrangin'. What do you say?
Okay, got just the one for you. Ledger's just beggin' to be changed and the Guild could use the coin. How about it?
Have a client lookin' to have a rival's business ledger changed. Don't know the reason, and don't want to know. Count you in?
Got a personal request from Brynjolf on this numbers job. He says we may hit 'em hard later, and wants to prep their books. Help us out?
These marks keep their ledger all neat and tidy, but they're ripe for some change if you know what I mean. Take it?
All right. Got a simple one. Just get in, change the books and be back in time for last call. So how's about it?
Feels good to be mining again.
How can you say that? This mine was filled with draugr not too long ago.
I feel like any moment, a draugr is going to come and chop my head off.
Steel your nerves. The draugr are gone. Focus on your mining.
Those draugr are going to come up and kill us all.
They haven't moved out of the caves. I think we're safe.
[QUOTE]We're safe[QUOTE] he says. You'll eat those words when a draugr is tearing into your face.
The guards say no draugr have come out of the mine.
Those draugr are going to be back. I can feel it.
Don't be such a coward. We haven't seen any draugr since the mine was cleared. Be grateful.
I don't think it's safe mining a cave on top of that crypt.
There's a war on. We need every scrap of ore we can get, so we're going to keep digging. Understand?
Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you.
When a client needs us to eliminate another, we don't operate like the Dark Brotherhood. We find alternate means to get them out of the way.
We send you to plant some phony evidence in the mark's house, and then tip off the town guard... the rest takes care of itself.
Sound like you can handle it?
Someone wants to see this mark suffer. They're paying a good bit of coin to have us plant the evidence in their house. You in?
This one should be easy. Get in, plant the goods and get out. Quiet and neat. Sound like your kind of job?
The mark must have ticked-off our client badly. He's impatient and keeps asking if the job's done. Can you get him off my back?
Got a good one here. Personal score to settle between myself and this mark. You up for it?
Brynjolf finally got some dirt on the mark and the evidence to back it up. Think you can give him a hand?
This one angered someone pretty high up in the keep. Can I count on you to get this done for me?
Got another personal score to settle and I'd consider it a favor if you'd take the job. Think you can help me out?
Sure, sure. Got one that should be pretty easy, as long as you keep your weapon sheathed. Can you handle it?
Yeah. Someone ticked off Maven and she wants to teach them a lesson... our way. You in?
We tunneled into an old Nordic crypt. The whole place is crawling with draugr.
We're not mining up any ore with those undead around, so I wouldn't go down there if I were you.
You did? We were waiting for the Jarl to send an entire regiment to clear that mine.
Now we can get back to work. Thank you.
I don't have to take this from the likes of you.
Pretty simple. Break into a house, grab a specific item and get out before they realize what's going on.
The catch is you can't kill anyone who lives there or you forfeit the payment.
You ready for some good old-fashioned burglary?
We're looking to recover an heirloom for a client. They claim ownership of it, and as long as they're paying we don't really care. You in?
We've been trying to get this item for a while, but no one with the skills has come along to claim it. Can I count on you to get it?
Have a house with a good bit of valuables inside, but one particular item's caught my eye. You up for it?
Got a tip on a desirable item at this location. We want you to break in there and bring it to us. What do you think?
Good, got a buyer in a rush for this item. If you hurry we can turn it around and make a quick profit. Can you get it?
Sure, sure. We're always looking to get our hands on items from all over Skyrim. How about this one?
As long as you can keep things quiet and don't get yourself killed in the process, this place has exactly what we're looking for. You in?
We've actually stolen this item before and somehow it ended up back in some other mark's house. Guess it's time to reclaim it, eh?
Ah, is there any weapon finer than an Orc blade?
No, mother. It's no wonder our enemies fear the sight of an Orc warrior.
The metal has been stubborn today. It refuses to bend.
Save your anger for the forge. The steel cannot hear your whining.
Sorry, mother. I'll focus on my work.
Imagine the heads of your enemies as you forge. Let your hatred work the steel.
You'll come of age soon. Time to be married to another chief.
I won't be married to some weak-willed Orc chieften. I'd sooner join the Legion.
I served in the Legion. Perhaps I'll show you some of their technique one of these days.
Books. Don't know why the Imperials like these so much. This should help the boy, though, Malacath willing.
Here, let me show you how an Orc learns to smith.
Tacitus? Boy's an Imperial. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it.
In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess.
If you find a book called [QUOTE]The Last Scabbard of Akrash,[QUOTE] could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example.
Only that they break an old woman's heart. So many friends, so many kin, all lost trying to rebuild a past that was over long ago.
Thank you. He can be a bit difficult, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your help.
New to Skyrim? I was confused at first, too. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead.
It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.
Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death.
It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.
All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway.

What of it, he says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
What of it, she says. Your Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
You can tell Jarl Igmund that the Silver-Blood family won't tolerate his cowardice for much longer.
Finally, someone with decent sense. The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for. Honor. Pride. Mighty Talos.
Jarl Igmund can't ignore us for much longer. Not if the Silver-Blood family has a say.
There's a war on and you don't know what I'm talking about? The Empire is destroying everything Skyrim stands for.
Jarl Igmund can refuse to see me all he wants. The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
That's a true Nord hero. A legend. So great that the Divines themselves lifted his soul into the heavens and made him a god.
He founded the Empire, and now they've turned their back on him. To appease the Elves. Elves! Do the Elves rule Skyrim, or do the Nords?

We keep the Reach safe. We flood Markarth with wealth, but does the Jarl listen to us when we want a say? No.
He's busy forgetting that Ulfric Stormcloak saved this city from the Forsworn. Ulfric's a hero, not a damn criminal.
They started the Great War. Nearly destroyed the Imperial City. Then the Emperor took the coward's way out and surrendered.

He used the Thu'um. Shouted those Forsworn from the walls. Then he led a band of Nord warriors in to take the city.
Just like Talos himself at the Battle of Old Hroldan, reclaiming the Reach from those heathen natives.
What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.
Angry and astonished: [QUOTE]The wealth of artifacts that I've based TWO human lifetimes of research on?[QUOTE]
Magic. That's what they always want. Never history. Never the secrets of the lost races. No, just little spells and enchantments.
I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research?
You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me!
I... I'm sorry I... I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very... stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?
Make sure that he is.

Yes. According to Giraud, our histories keeper, the portion of the Edda dealing with King Olaf might still exist in Dead Man's Respite.

I'll shoulder some of your burden.

thinking aloud
Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia...
What? Something you're still confused about?
Not here. Downstairs.
The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor.
I can get you into one of those parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files.
I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you.
His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him.
I'll get word for him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it?
While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party.
last sentence said with a grin -- she knows she's just given you a laundry list of questions
called across noisy tavern
laconically
I believe she's trying to look as ravishing as possible for you, milord.
Grelka, I wanted to talk about that suit of leather armor you sold me. The fasteners are already coming loose.
Fine. It'll be five septims to repair it.
Why should I pay for a repair on something I just bought?
All right, all right. Just bring it to me tomorrow and I'll fix it for you.
Grelka, how fast can you get your hands on some longbows?
I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?
I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.
I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.
Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?
I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.
I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?
Did you do everything I said, Shadr?
Yes. The man came by at noon just like you said. I gave him the package and he gave me this pouch for you.
The package was heavy... I needed his help getting it on his horse. What was inside?
Hey, I told you not to ask any questions. Now, here. For your trouble.
Hmm. There's no simple answer to that. You want the long version or the short version?
When I was young, our leaders became obsessed with the Thalmor threat.
They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect her against the Thalmor.
They believed that if and when we found a Dragonborn, we would need to protect him against the Thalmor.
We hurt them in the past, and they have long memories.
Thanks, Grelka!
So while I was in Ivarstead, I heard news that something terrible happened at Helgen.
You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.
If that's true, then we have much more to fear than the Thieves Guild.
I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.
Dinya, about that incense you requested? Its not arriving anytime soon. The Khajiit caravans are having tough times getting through.
That's a shame. What's causing them all the trouble?
There's the stories about Helgen, bandits, skirmishes between the Stormcloaks and the Imperials... it almost seems endless.
Chin up, Brand-Shei. Lady Mara will provide us strength and guidance through these difficult times.
Has the Thieves Guild visited you yet, Haelga?
They haven't been by the Bunkhouse, but I'm certain they will. How about you?
No. I'm surprised actually. I thought they had a stranglehold on the city, but in the last few years, it hasn't been that bad.
Perhaps they moved on to greener pastures. Whatever the reason, lets be glad they're scarce.
Well met, Brand-Shei. I've come by to browse your wares today.
Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard Aerin mentioning it.
It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the Red Mountain.
Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.
Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?
What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.
Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me.
Weirded out at beginning
Thanks for that bushel of apples, Marise. They're wonderful. How did you keep them so fresh?
Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.
Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it and you'll have me as a customer for life.
I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.
I thought it was strange that Aringoth stopped coming into town. I suppose he's having some difficulties out there.
May I ask what all the honey's for? I mean, you used to buy almost a jar a week. Are you cooking or something?
sly... wink and a nod kind of way
Hey. What's the matter with you? You have no right to spread rumors around town about me.
What rumors?
You know very well what I'm talking about. You're saying that I only married Bolli for his gold and that I don't really love him.
Well, if the shoe fits...
Relax, Marise... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment.
You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these dragons?
I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.
Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.
You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to.
You're a cold, unfeeling bitch.
My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt.
I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall.
At this loss...
We weep.
We grieve.
We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.
Let's go. We need to get to the Western Watchtower before it's too late.
I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.
Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.

The Greybeards are masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.
Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun?
That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar!
This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!
That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back. Now then...

The only reason you have the gold for your [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] is because I gave it to you.
I'll pay you back, if it means that much.
It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free.
The sooner you remember that, the better.
Haelga, we need to stop seeing each other.
Oh, Bolli you silly man. You weren't saying that when you were licking that honey off my...
Haelga! That's just it. I can't keep up with you. Your Dibellan techniques... they're exhausting.
Is it really me, or is it your wife? You need to make a choice Bolli. The honey or her.
When are you going to take me away from here Bolli?
I told you, I can't just pick up and leave. I have my wife, my business... not to mention you have the Bunkhouse.
That old place? I could care less about it. Its you I want, Bolli.
I... I'm sorry Haelga, I can't. Not yet.
Sometimes I'm not certain that the people of Riften want to be helped.
I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are.
Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything.
It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.
Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial reinforcements taking us by surprise.
So, what do you think of my plan. You in or out?
This is the bridge out of town. The path up the mountain to the northwest leads to Bleak Falls Barrow.
I guess I should get back to my brother. He'll throw a fit if I take too long. Such a child....
The rest of you lot are with me.
If you think I'd would make a move like that without asking Maven, you're out of your mind. Doing that would be a fatal mistake.
Come on, think about it. She'd reward us!
If you want to go out to Whiterun and burn that meadery down, go right ahead.
And when the guard traces it back here, and Maven is implicated, I'll be sure to tell her it was your idea.
I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for.
So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?
Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?
Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.
say slightly deviously... so other person almost wouldn't pick up on it
Did he now? I can only hope.
You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least.
You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise.
Everyone else, with me.
Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it.
Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.
I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.
One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.
Good. Don't fail me.
Keeping busy, Sergius?
As always. The Nords don't ever stop wanting things enchanted.
At least it's more money for the College.
Perhaps, but it just means more work for me.
Do you think you might, err, have a moment to look at something for me?
If this is another dwarven trinket, I keep telling you I'm not familiar with them.
Yes, I just thought perhaps you'd have, err, come across something like this before.
Why, because I'm a Dunmer? We didn't all grow up in dwarven ruins, you know.
Well, err, yes. Sorry to have troubled you.
Hello, Nirya.
Ah, err, yes. Sorry.

How are you, Drevis?

What are you up to, Gane? Hmm?
What? Err, nothing!
Some days I marvel that you haven't managed to blow yourself up.
If you see Karliah, don't hesitate. Kill her.
That's enough of this unnecessary chatting, we need to keep going.
Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.
Have your weapon at the ready. I'm certain Karliah knows we're here.
Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
When you're ready, meet me at Snow Veil Sanctum.
Leave, stranger. Evil stirs in this place. I fear for the security of the very land if it should break free.
We stand at the tomb of Hevnoraak, who has been dead for many generations. I fear, however, that his return may be at hand.
With regret, not melodrama
By now I can barely contain his power, much less defeat him if he awakens. But with the help of a living champion I may be able to succeed.
You would do this? Three vessels in the tomb below hold the power to vanquish Hevnoraak. Before anything else, we need those.
Bring them to me - but be careful, mortal. They are guarded by Hevnoraak's minions. They will stop at nothing to see their master return.
You've found the vessels. I worried that I had sent you to your death.
(Heavy breathing)
I'm proud to be your battle-brother, Dragonborn. Whiterun doesn't need to fear with you on our side.
You sure took care of that dragon. Dragonborn or not, that's good enough for me.
I can't believe we actually killed a dragon!
Dragonborn... it's an honor.
You saved Whiterun today. We won't forget.
Come on, I want a better look at that thing.
We taught that dragon not to mess with Whiterun, didn't we?
I'm glad you're on our side.
Get under cover! The dragon - it's still around somewhere!
I'm glad you're coming with us. They say Talos favors you.
That dragon should've stuck with killing Imperials. Now he's going to learn how real Nords fight.
My cousin's stationed out at the watchtower. I hope he's all right.
I doubt any of us are coming back from this mission.
With Irileth, you either come back covered with glory or not at all.
You really think we can kill a dragon?
I'm looking forward to testing myself against this dragon.
I hear you faced a dragon at Helgen and lived to tell about it. That ain't nothing.
We'd better keep moving. Who knows what that dragon is doing.
I hope the tower holds out until we get there.
This doesn't look good.
Shor's bones, did it kill them all...?
We'd better find out what's happened.
wearily - you just ran all the way from there to deliver the news
Hold on. I want to hear what Irileth's saying.
That may be true, but I ordered Irileth to bring back proof. You'd best report back to her at once.
We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.
Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!
That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few.
I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us.
You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.
I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.
Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.
with a note of awe/reverence
You've done a great service for me and my city, Dragonborn.
So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?
Help Irileth kill this dragon before it can attack Whiterun. There's no time to lose.
There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again.
I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon.
You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here.
I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.
emphasis on [QUOTE]YOU[QUOTE] -- he knows all about it, he just wants to see what you know
There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun.
But there must be more to it than that. Did something... strange... happen when the dragon died?
Very well. Meet me at the summoning circle in the marsh at dawn. We shall banish the creature you have become.
Which is utterly useless at the moment. You need to fill it with a soul.
Good, you're here.
As you desire.
Stand in the center of the circle.

You are human again. Like the rest of us.
You could? I've got some coin coming in from my last shipment. It's yours if you bring my claw back.
If you're going after those thieves, you should head to Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town.
Oh really? Well, I'm not going to hold my breath.
The thieves are up in Bleak Falls Barrow, northeast of town. I'd take you there, but with Lucan gone, I'm busy with the store.
Still no word from your family?
No, and I'm not expecting any.
Really? That must be so nice. I came all the way to Skyrim just to get away from my family's expectations.
My family didn't really approve of me coming here at all.
Oh. Well, that's... awkward. Sorry to have brought it up.
Have you heard from your family recently?
No, not really. Couriers don't seem to like delivering letters here.
Ah, that's too bad.
Not at all. It means I'm not being hounded about my progress at the College.
J'zargo continues to struggle with wards. You have time to practice?
Maybe later. I'm sort of busy now.
J'zargo understands. You hesitate because you know J'zargo will be better than you. Very well.
Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.
Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.
Well, I suppose I could use a hand with something, yes.
Faralda's working on something, and I want to know what it is.
I want her notes. You think you could get them for me, without her knowing?
Yes, yes it is.
You have a problem with that?
Look, either you get the notes or I'll figure out another way to do it. Just come find me if you can get your hands on them.
I'll throw some money at you. Good enough?
Just get the notes and bring them to me. If you can't do it, I'll find some other way to manage it.
I'm still waiting for those notes, if you can get them.
She what?
Oh, I should've known she'd try it again!
Thanks for warning me. I'll see to it this is taken care of.
Good, good. She didn't see you take them?
Al right, this should be enough to figure out what she's up to. Then I can make sure it doesn't work.
Good work. Here, take this, and keep quiet.
in urgent undertone
It's the escaped prisoners!
Get this gate open.
People of Riften, heed my words. The return of the dragons is not mere coincidence.
This is one of the signs. The signs that Lady Mara is displeased with your constant inebriation.
No, no... Maramal... we talked about this. Talen...
Put down your flagons filled with your vile liquids and embrace the teachings of the handmaiden of Kyne.
Keerava, certainly we can come to some sort of an understanding. These people must be made aware of the chaos they've sown.
Enough, Maramal. We've all heard of the dragons and their return. There's no need to use them as an excuse to harass our customers.
Very well, Talen. I'll remove myself from this den of iniquity.
sarcastically accentuate [QUOTE]sin[QUOTE]
Well done. They never knew what hit them.
We had the advantage of surprise this time, but don't expect it to last. Let's move out.
Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier.
Get the crown already. We don't need to hang around here any longer than necessary.
The crown should be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes open.
It's the Legion!
Imperials! Kill them!
The Legion is here! Defend the entrance!
Ah, Viarmo.  I assume you are here to petition for the reinstatement of the Burning of King Olaf Festival.
I am, Jarl. I wish to present King Olaf's verse from the Poetic Edda. Recovered this very day from the Bards Tomb.
Ah, you mentioned something that would convince us the festival should take place but I didn't expect King Olaf's lost verse. Please proceed.
I would not sell it to just anyone but I'll make an exception for you. The cost to replace the gem is quite high.
I believe this gem is worth more than you are at the moment.
I would hate to see our reputation further tarnished.
Very good. I hope this will allow us to maintain our reputation.
You've been suspended from the College for what you did. You'd better talk to Tolfdir if you want to get it sorted out.
I'm sorry, but you've been suspended from the College. I can't be seen talking to you right now.
It requires a filled black soul gem. You will need to kill someone.
When you have a gem and have filled it return to me and I will perform the ritual. I will bring life to your dead body, vampire.
I met several of your kind during my studies of life-extending magics. I even  considered becoming a vampire myself.
In the end, vampirism would endanger my ward Agni which would defeat the intended purpose.
They are rare things, I have one I picked up during my research of the Oblivion realms but it is a precious item.
They say Falion of Morthal has studied vampires, draugr and all matter of undead.
Here's the situation.
A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.
You heard right! I said a dragon!
I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!
That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle.
Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?
But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families.
But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?
Damn right!

I don't need your jokes right now, but maybe you have a point. Maybe Camilla needs some help seeing Sven for what he is.
Could you... could you give her this letter, and say it's from Sven? I think I've matched that Nord's lack of cleverness perfectly.

You can tell Sven that he already has a mother. I'm not speaking to him anymore.
He what? What are you talking about?
Why that jealous idiot. Thought he could just manipulate me into never seeing Sven again?
Thank you for telling me the truth. You should speak to Sven. I'm sure he'll want to thank you, too, for defending his name.
As if I would write this dribble. How about we play a bit of turnabout with Faendal?
Here. I had to use simple words, but this letter should convince Camilla it's from him.
You may be right. Camilla may see Faendal as little more than a friend, but why take chances?
Here. Give Camilla this letter. It's full of venomous nonsense. Tell her it's from Faendal.
Camilla Valerius knows I'm the best man in Riverwood. That elf is kidding himself if he thinks she would choose him over me.
I've seen him sneaking over to the Riverwood Trader to speak with her when I'm not around. He's wasting his time.
Is that sarcasm? I've heard better wisecracks from Orgnar.
Still, you have a point. Camilla letting Faendal visit her isn't a good thing for me.
Here, let me give you a particularly venomous letter. Say it's from Faendal. That should get Camilla to stop inviting the elf over.
What is that blowhard up to now?
So, he thinks he can turn Camilla against me? Two can play at this.
Here. Give this letter to Camilla and tell her it's from Sven. Let's see what she thinks of him after reading that.
From Faendal? That's strange. He's never written to me before.
What, what is this? Is this what he really thinks about me?
Well, you can tell that... that long-eared ass not to come around the store anymore. He's not welcome.
What are you talking about? What's in the letter?
Oh my. He... he wanted me to think Faendal wrote this?
Thank you for telling me the truth. Could you talk to Faendal, as well?  I'm sure he'll want to thank you for standing up for him.
Now that's what I like to hear. Good work. I think you deserve some gold from my tips at the inn.
I appreciate your help. Please, take this. Some gold I've saved up from working at the mill.
If that's what you want. Come find me at the College if you change your mind.
You'll be all right on your own? Then I'll see you back at the College.
I understand. We must all follow our own paths. If you wish to find me again, I'll be in Nightcaller Temple.
Farewell, then. If you need my services again, just come and look for me in the usual place.
His pride is a bit wounded that the player does not want to adventure with him anymore, and he's trying to sound like he doesn't care.

Yes. Congratulations, you are now a full-fledged member of the Bards College.
Due to your adventurous nature several of the college professors have some things they wish you to do.
What's more, Elisif has declared the Burning of King Olaf should become a weekly event.
And finally, there's the matter of the Patronage that Elisif wanted me to give you.
Ah the bard-to-be. Did Viarmo send you?
Not many come to see me. What do you want?
I know many things. I have studied things beyond the reach of most humans, traveled the Oblivion planes, seen things one should not see.
I have met Daedra and Dwemer and everything in between and I know enough to see a vampire where others would see a man.
I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.

The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door.
The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak.
Let him guide your path.
I have vowed to serve Amaund Motierre until my dying breath. Best remember that.
Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life.
Rexus. The items.
Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.
Somethin' ya need? Anything for the guild.
Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited.
Oh. Oh I see.
Well, you're makin' friends all over, ain't ya?
So, uh... how is Astrid doing' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.
Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?
Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up.
Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need?
Let's see...
whistles at the beginning of the line, like he can't believe what he's holding.
This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly.
Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie-
Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet?
very sleazy, slimy, like he knows he shouldn't be doing it, but can't resist.
like he's busy doing something (writing a note)
Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement.
You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.
Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?
The Elder Council...
Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious.
Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?

Skyrim is the birth place of the Empire. We won't let a bunch of thugs rob her of her lineage.

The Empire is man's last bastion. If Ulfric wasn't blinded by lust for power, he'd see we are on the same side.
Ulfric would expunge from Skyrim citizens whose only crime was to be born of a non-Nordic woman. That is unacceptable to free men everywhere.

I'll fight the entire Legion myself if they dare show their faces here.
Legion soldiers gleam like fresh-fallen snow and clank like a kitchen. They head this way, we'll know it.
I long to be out there, with my brothers, waging war against the Empire.
Keep an eye out for Stormcloak spies.
Been so long since I killed a Stormcloak, my sword arm's getting flabby.
Stay alert. Never know when those Stormcloak dogs might charge.
Did I ever tell you about the day when Skald the Elder was Skald the Younger?
I can't imagine Skald ever being young.
Oh, he was young, and handsome. I had half a mind to go after him, myself, before I met my husband.
Frida, you aren't saying....
I was a beauty in my day, dearie. Don't act so surprised.
Dawnstar has always held its own against the bandits and wild animals of the Pale.
Did you ever have to fight off bandits, Frida? Like in your stories?
Why, I once fought alongside your father when we were both younger. Saved him from getting his fool head sliced off.
Who were you fighting against?
Oh, dearie, it was so long ago. But I do remember the celebration we had afterwards. Mead never tasted so good.
Thoring, do you remember the time when that wolf pack come clamoring into town?
How could I forget? That old alpha male almost took off my leg.
Never did find out why they came sprawling into town like that.
Animals in the Pale don't need a reason to attack Dawnstar. It's just their nature.
Now, who was it that kidnapped the Jarl's son 20 years ago?
You mean Hildolf the Skull-Splitter? Remember when we rounded up the townspeople and dragged him out of that cave?
Those were the days. I'd never seen my husband fight so bravely before.
Aye, to your husband. Divines bless his memory.
Tough day at the mines. I swear the ore is getting harder to dig.
You're just getting older.
That's why I come here to talk to you. You're all heart.
You should quit working in the Eastern Mine. Leigelf's no good to work for.
Leigelf is a good man, and I'm not running out on him now.
Oh, got a bit of an interest in your boss do you?
No, not that it's any of your business.
That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times.
Good dog.
Stupid dog.
No going back that way, now.
Hmm. That doesn't go anywhere.
I guess we'd better try this way.
I'd rather not tangle with her right now. Let's try to sneak by. Just take it nice and slow, and watch where you step.
Go ahead. I'll follow your lead and watch your back.
Sneaking is overrated, eh?
That looks like the way out! I knew we'd make it!
Surely even down in Cyrodiil people have heard news of the war in Skyrim?
The Nords are tired of spending our blood fighting the Empire's wars, and paying for the Empire's decadence with our taxes.
enthusiastically
You haven't heard of the civil war in Skyrim? I guess down in Cyrodiil people have other things to worry about.
It's pretty simple. Ulfric founded the Stormcloaks years ago, as a sort of private army to advance his ambitions.
He's always used the ban on the worship of Talos to stir people up against the Empire.
He never succeeded in getting much support, so a few months ago he murdered the High King! That got the Empire's attention.
I was assigned to Ulfric's guard. We were on our way to Darkwater Crossing, in the south of Eastmarch.
The Imperials were waiting for us. As pretty an ambush as I ever saw. We were outnumbered five to one, at least.
Ulfric ordered us to stop fighting. Didn't want us all to die for nothing, I guess.
I thought they were taking us south to Cyrodiil. Parade us in front of the Emperor. But then we stopped in Helgen, and you know the rest.
admiringly
We've been trying to catch Ulfric since the war started, but he always seemed to slip through our fingers... like he knew we were coming.
This time, the General turned the tables on him. Ulfric rode right into our ambush with only a few bodyguards.
He surrendered pretty meekly, too. So much for his death-or-glory reputation.
I thought we were taking Ulfric back to Cyrodiil, but I guess the General changed his mind. You know the rest.
I swear, if I wasn't around, Elgrim would forget to eat his meals. How we make any coin at all is beyond me.
In fact, I need to arrange for someone to pick up an ore sample for me in Shor's Stone... goodness knows Elgrim won't lift a finger to do it.
When Elgrim said we were setting up shop down here, I told him he would catch his death.
The dirt, the moisture... it's disgusting. Who wants to spend their life living like a skeever?
I know how to mix a few basic potions, but I'm nowhere near as skilled as a master alchemist.
I've picked up a few tricks by reading the tomes scattered all over the shop, but I don't have the knack to pull half of the formulas off.
He's been gushing about how talented Ingun is at alchemy. He'd never say it to her face; that's not his way.
I just think Elgrim's taken it upon himself to mentor the young thing so he focuses a lot of attention on her.
You would? Oh, that would be wonderful.
Speak to Filnjar in Shor's Stone. He's got some sort of ore sample he wants us to identify and was willing to pay us well for it.
The job pays well, so I hope I can make arrangements soon. We could really use the gold.
hearty laugh at end
Here you go. Tell Hafjorg that she can chip off whatever she thinks is a fair trade for their time.
Redbelly is supposed to be nothing but an iron mine. Been working it for years.
Then right before the spiders had moved in, we found that chunk of ore. Never seen anything like it.
I want to know what I'm dealing with before I start tearing it out of the ground.
sarcasm at the end... the thank you is genuine
Here, I had him make you a few things for all that travel.
I do. Sadly, I'm one of the few traditional Saxhleel Jewelers that remains in Tamriel; it's becoming a lost art.
Only trouble is gathering materials has become hazardous. The roads to the mines and to the other cities are thick with bandits... and worse.
Would you be interested in gathering some materials for me? I'd certainly be happy to compensate you.
Thank you, marsh-friend.
Thank you, land-strider.
I'm seeking a small list of items to complete my next creation: two flawless sapphires, a mammoth tusk and a chunk of gold ore.
Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel call my kind Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.
Forgive me. It's a term I haven't used in some time. While most in Tamriel would call us Argonian, we prefer the term Saxhleel.
Madesi was actually my original Saxhleel name. Unlike others, I decided to embrace tradition and keep it that way.
Good, these will make wonderful settings for my rings.
The ivory from this tusk will be perfect for the inlay on my amulets.
Perfect. Melting this down will give me plenty of gold for those necklaces I started.
No, I think I have enough here to get started.
Here, let me give you this. It's the least I can do for all your trouble.
And this must be the Hall of Stories.
Oh... I've heard of this. These walls are supposed to show the history of the ancients who built this place.
Too bad we can't read these carvings.  Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?
One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.
wondering at the dead bodies
Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door.
See what you can figure out auxillary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.
Hmm... what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for.
Careful! I wouldn't do that again unless you know for sure it's going to open.
Uh oh! Look out!
Maybe there's something on the claw itself that could help us.
delivering a serious revelation
By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal and in essence, caused our luck to run dry.
a bit surprised Player isn't getting the big picture
All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield great power, securely sealed within our minds.
Once you realize the Key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless.
Ah, so they've finally sent someone to deal with that lunatic.
Well, is it taken care of?
Well, that's good to know. I suggest you tell your people at the College to keep a tighter leash on their mages.
I'm afraid so. There's a problem with one of the Jarls here in Skyrim.
He's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in his hold.
She's been complaining of a member of the College running amok in her hold.
We have, of course, severed all ties with the mage in question, but the Jarl isn't appeased.
So, the mage needs to be [QUOTE]taken care of,[QUOTE] if you understand me.
This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous.
All these damn Stormcloaks. They're making me nervous. Never in a million years did I imagine they'd gain control of Solitude.
Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's life.
I'm all for diplomacy, but the sooner the Emperor deals with this civil war mess, the sooner we can get back to Cyrodiil.
You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.
I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined... and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.
You misunderstand. It's just... I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck.
You'd do well to get out of here before I change my mind and have you locked in irons...
The Imperials wouldn't have just let you walk away. Remember that.
Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.
It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look.
Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.
Dear sister, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting.
Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.
a bit grumpy... not sure you believe in what you're doing
What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.
nervous about having bad news
Lazy oaf.
Where are my goods? Did the shipment come in?
Only a few things came today. Cedran said he'd drop it off later.
Careful. You spill one drop of silver, I'm taking it out of your hide.
I'm being as careful as I can.
Did you just talk back to me? I'm not paid to listen. I'm paid to keep you working. Now work.
Mulush, we need a break. The heat from the smelter is too much.
Are you complaining? Work. If you have strength to whine, you have strength to smelt.
I could smelt metal in half the time as you weak-willed pink-skins. Do I have to do everything?
No Mulush. I'll work harder.
I don't want any of you thieving workers even thinking about stealing any silver.
If I see you sneaking off with even one speck of silver, I'll break your leg and throw you into the river.
Yes, Mulush.
Careful of the molten metal. That gets on you, kiss your fingers goodbye.
I know what I'm doing. Stop telling me.
Divines, I'm tired. This is too much work.
Just keep at it, or Mulush will beat you.
Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh?
I remember you... you were with us at Helgen. I heard you joined us. Welcome to the Stormcloaks!
a shiver runs down your spine
These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say.
You, too, huh? I'd take a straight fight with the whole Legion over creeping around a place like this.
bucking himself up
You must be the new recruit. Welcome to the Legion.
At least we got the damn crown. I hope it was worth it.
I wish the Legate would let us clear out of here. Place gives me the creeps.
I don't know what we're doing here, but orders are orders.
I keep thinking I see something moving in the shadows...
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Stormcloaks in here.
It's the waiting that gets me.
I don't like the look of this place.
Nobody allowed in. Ulfric Stormcloak's orders. Consider yourself warned.
You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, brother.
You must be the new unblooded. Welcome to the fight, sister.
I wish Galmar would hurry it up. We shouldn't be here.
I don't know what we're doing here. Ulfric must have his reasons.
What are we waiting for?
I hope we don't run into anything worse than Imperials in here.
Keep a sharp eye out.
Don't interfere with Imperial Legion business. Now move along, unless you want three inches of steel in your gut.
The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish.
[QUOTE]in life and in death[QUOTE] should stand out
amused - [QUOTE]it figures[QUOTE]
finally agreeing
What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?
Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.
By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal.
You'll be provided all of the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale.
You're free to use those powers as you see fit to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.
In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises.
More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians.

Sometimes I miss the Legion, back when the Empire stood up for Skyrim.
No politics, Thongvor. I told you before.
Good to see you, my friend! I knew you'd make a proper Legionnaire.
I'm glad you'll be with me in there. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
I'm glad you're with us. I don't like the looks of this place... and I'm not talking about the Stormcloaks.
These old ruins... They don't want us here, the ancient ones. Better left alone.
dismissing his own fears, cheering himself up
You, too, huh? I'd much rather a straight up fight than creeping around a place like this.
You've come for me, have you?
You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you?
Come then. See what I can do now.
You're the one with the staff, my boy.
You're the one with the staff, my dear.
If it can help us get inside the College, and reach Ancano, we'll have to hope that there's a way to stop all this.
Be on your guard. I've no idea what to expect inside the College.
Head for the Great Hall, quickly! Don't stop for anything!
Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return.
Why are you here? Killing Gaius Maro is but the first step of your contract - you must also plant the incriminating letter on his body...
Yes, I know. As does Astrid. You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned.
But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with.
It's... Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.
Yes, I know. As does Astrid. And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware.
What should we have tonight?
Something simple, a stew perhaps.
Stew again, papa? I want steak.
Maybe we could spend a little bit more and buy some meat, Endon.
Maybe. Let me think about it.
Markarth has changed, but the inn is as lively as ever.
The city hasn't changed that much, dear. Same old dwarven stones gathering the same old moss.
The stones aren't what bother me, love. The Forsworn are tearing the Reach apart.
Let's not talk about this over dinner.
Look at you, begging on the streets. Learn a trade.
Picking on me again, you backbiting Nord? Tired of those prissy nobles turning down your rotten slabs of venison?
How dare you. No one turns down cut meat from Hogni Red-Arm!
Hogni Red-Arm, more like Hogni Fat-Arm.
Alms. Give me some meat, you fat Nord!
What did you say to me, Reachman?
I said give me some meat. I'm hungry, and the Divines know you don't need more food in that huge gut of yours.
You little twig. I'll snap you in two!
Just try it. Maybe a little time inside Cidhna Mine will get rid of all that fat on you.
laughing, pleasantly surprised
genuine
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.
This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.
a bit smug, about to unveil a secret?
sense of wonderment
The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose.
It helped avert attention from our true nature.
wry humor
I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?
This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business.
This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century.
It's my hope that you will, yes.
This isn't about religion or destiny. This is nothing more than a business transaction between yourself and Nocturnal.
Consider this an extremely risky job but with a massive potential for profit, and you'll do fine.
emotive - an oath to a goddess
humbled - speaking to a goddess
Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels.
We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.
Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.
Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer... the leadership of the Guild.
bored and arrogant
It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.
Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur.
It's the same dream over and over again. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!
Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen.
I... I will. Thank you...
Now, we'll take our friend here back to Hammerfell, where she will pay the price for her treason.
Not on the way back. Once she gets there, it's not up to me to decide what's done with her.
And as for you, I owe you a portion of the reward, don't I?
Well, here you go. Spend it wisely, and if I may... Don't allow yourself to be fooled by a pretty face. You're better than that.
Stay your hand, warrior!
It's no secret why you're here and you have proven your skill in combat. Let us talk a moment, and no one else needs to die.
I think we can all profit from the situation in which we find ourselves.
My men will not attack you, if you will lower your weapons.
Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.
Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision.
You are not happy with this decision/reluctant
We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.
Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.
Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside.
At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.
I suggest you talk to Karliah first. She has some news that'll turn your stomach.
a bit annoyed
This is enough to make your head spin, eh?
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.
I'm just as puzzled as you, lad.
I'm just as puzzled as you, lass.
I think we can trust Karliah. Let's see what she's on about.
I have some preparations of my own to make. I'll meet you at the stone.
Not now, lass. Karliah said it was important.
We'll speak when the Oath is complete.
You appear ready for the Oath.
You appear hesitant to don your Nightingale Armor. What's troubling you?
It's just ahead. Please, keep following.
I'm preparing to leave for the standing stone. What is it?
I promise you, all your questions will be answered. You just have to trust me.
From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course.
Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's memory to rest.
a bit of regret
gloating
It's the rebels! Defend the entrance!
Stormcloaks!
it's true, but making a joke
Get yourself kitted out with what you need. Welcome to the fight, brother!
This temple is dedicated to Mara, and the light of love she shines on us all.
I'm only a humble acolyte, though. If you wish to avail yourself of Mara's blessing, you should speak with Dinya Balu or Maramal.
They should be back shortly. You're welcome to wait here if you like.
Mind you, it's no business of mine what each Companion does in the name of honor.
But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your standing. Aela knows better, and so should you.
In any case, I have a task for you.
Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
Aye, that sounds like him.
As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you.
The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated than that.
It always is.
The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred.
One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven.
If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.
They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else.
But we had been deceived.
The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies.
We'll get to that.
It's not so simple as just killing them, though.
Ah yes, their trickery.
The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit.
Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds.
For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity.
And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out.
And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us.
They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force.
I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in  the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild.
And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.
You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy.
Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive.
This is not about your desires, lad.
This is not about your desires, lass.
No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad.
But you and I are going to reclaim them.
We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung.
We will avenge Kodlak. And they will know terror before the end.
The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now.
Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.
Before the ancient flame...
For the fallen...
Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. It should open the way.
Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad, still?
I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.
Don't get too flowery on me, lad.
Don't get too flowery on me, lass.
Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine.
And so slain the beast inside of me.
I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though.
Perhaps from Sovngarde, the heroes of old can join me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph.
And perhaps some day, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory.
And lead the Companions to further glory.
Aela's laid claim to your services, and I've learned the hard way not to upset her. Best you stick to her for now.
Aela said you were hers, and I wasn't supposed to interfere. She scares me.
And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak's gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you.
My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.
We did well today, Shield-Brother.
We did well today, Shield-Sister.
Please, our tribe suffers and we need help.
Our Chief, Yamarz, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed.
He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home.
Yamarz refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need.
No, don't go!
No, don't go! You may not be one of our tribe, but you are an Orc nonetheless!
We meet at last, my dear lady.
What is this?
What have you done?
Oh, come now. You didn't really expect to manipulate people forever, did you? Your luck had to run out sometime.
But where will I go? I can't keep running forever!
After all this, I have to pick up and leave again?
If you really think this is the only way, I trust you. Let's not waste any time.
Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets [QUOTE]punished.[QUOTE]
Said like an angry growl
Wait, oh wait. I know you! Yes, yes. From the road! Cicero never forgets a face.
Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you.
Giggles after he says [QUOTE]keeping[QUOTE]
Why talk? Cicero has nothing to say to you. Call it a matter of... trust.
Oh, I do wish we could get to know each other better. But not now! I must tend to mother. See her settled.
Emphasis on both [QUOTE]my[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]our[QUOTE]
And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel!
Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget.
But you disappeared! You were there... then you weren't! Did you mean to help poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder...
Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!
Oh, but you didn't help poor Cicero! You helped that stupid farmer! Stupid Loreius! Oh, the guard said cruel things about us. Untrue things...
He said I attacked someone! On the road! But it never happened. Never. Sweet mother and I were just waiting. My knife was sheathed!
He said I was transporting weapons! For the war! In mother's coffin! He made me... open it! Indignity! Sacrilege!
He said I stole something! Me! Poor Cicero. A common thief. The very thought is insulting. One might even say... maddening.
So polite! So nice! Cicero likes you. The Night Mother is sure to like you too. Oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends.

Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old way. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed.

But do not make the mistake of underestimating the Legion. Plenty of them are Nords same as us.
You hear anything?
bragging a little
confidentially
giving orders
Get the crown. We will keep an eye out for more of those dustmen.
That crown should be around here somewhere. Just keep an eye out for the bonewalkers...
The Imperials are here in force. Stick together.
Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!
That's what I like to hear.
Alik'r, hold!
You've proven your strength, warrior. Let's avoid any more bloodshed.
I think you and I have some things to talk about.
Be careful on the way to Solitude. Damn Stormcloaks could be anywhere.
We'd better keep moving. I feel like that dragon might be up there watching us right now.
Good luck. If you get a chance, look me up in Solitude.
I'm going to rest up here a while before heading to Windhelm. Be careful.
We'd better keep moving. I don't want to run into any Imperials who know what happened at Helgen.
Good luck. Come to Windhelm and talk to Ulfric. You won't regret it.
See if you can find some, and I'll try to find some more interesting work by the time you get back.
A citizen of the Reach has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Haafingar has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Hjaalmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Falkreath has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Whiterun has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Pale has been kidnapped.
A citizen of the Rift has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Eastmarch has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Winterhold has been kidnapped.
A citizen of Skyrim has been kidnapped.
The Companions have been asked for assistance, and we shall answer. Particularly when the pay is as good as this.
Get moving. I shudder to think what might happen if you're too late.
People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos.
But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end.
Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim.
I just hope the war doesn't come to Riverwood. There's enough trouble in the world without those Stormcloaks stirring up more.
So did I! If the damn Stormcloaks somehow found one, or woke it up... the war might be about to take an ugly turn.
Hard to believe it was just a coincidence, that the first dragon anyone's seen for centuries attacks just as Ulfric was about to be executed.
You didn't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants.
Right, the leader of the Stormcloaks.
They claim to be fighting for Skyrim's freedom, but the war is really all about Ulfric wanting to be High King of Skyrim.
Oh, right, you were caught trying to cross the border into Skyrim, weren't you?
You're not kidding. Ulfric's the leader of the Stormcloaks - you know, the traitors trying to break Skyrim away from the Empire.
I guess that wasn't such a big deal elsewhere in the Empire, but here it's caused a lot of resentment. Native son and all that.
defensively
If he hadn't signed the peace treaty with the Thalmor, they would have destroyed the Empire - then where would Skyrim be?
That's the part that Ulfric's supporters always conveniently forget about. Unless the Empire stands together, the Thalmor will destroy us all.
It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship.
We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos.
But then Ulfric and his [QUOTE]Sons of Skyrim[QUOTE] started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down.
Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me.
This would be the first time the player has heard the name of the pirate group (Blood Horkers), so it should have the feel of an introduction.
I've got a top man on the job right now. He should be returning any moment.
I've got a sharp woman on the job right now. She should be returning any moment.
This must be him, then.
This must be her, then.
Hard to say. The weather's taken a bit of a turn, here.
Haldyn's been known to obscure his hideaways with magic.
If we take care of him, the way should be clear to properly assault the island.
Impressive work. We started the attack once you made the fog scamper away like that.
Hope you didn't catch any of the fire.
We can head back whenever you're set. There's celebrating to be done!
The Empire may have been good for Skyrim once upon a time, but those days are long past.
Banning the worship of Talos was the last straw. Thalmor everywhere, dragging people off for honoring our own gods!
I've got enough to worry about, taking care of my family. I don't concern myself with such matters.
eager, curious
almost wistfully
hastily
What? Oh, hardly! I don't think even Ulfric could pull a dragon out of his pocket.
a little giddy with relief
Seriously, you don't know? That was Ulfric Stormcloak himself.
Right. The leader of our fight against the Empire. I forget that most people don't know what he looks like, except for those Imperial wanted posters.
Oh, right, they said you were captured crossing the border.
Still, I'm surprised you haven't heard of Ulfric. He's our leader - the leader of the Stormcloaks.
I don't like this place. It feels like we're being... watched.
It's a simple job, Drennen. We get in, we steal the Lexicon, we leave. Don't get jumpy.
If you two cannot handle this, we can find others to hire.
Enough. Their services will be more than adequate. Let us continue.
This place is unbelievable.
Indeed. Avanchnzel is as much a library as it is a city. Built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer.
Anavchnzel is waiting.
Why are all these metal... things... ignoring us?
I told you we should have hired a thief.
emphasis on [QUOTE]are[QUOTE]
And yet none of us can pick a damned lock.
This place is huge.
It is large, indeed. I did not anticipate Avanchnzel's size or the time needed to uncover the entrance.
Maybe we should turn back. I don't want to sleep here.
Drennen, you do understand that the Lexicon at the bottom of this place holds the accumulated memories of centuries of Dwemer.
So we're not turning back, you fool.
I thought you said these things were [QUOTE]sleeping[QUOTE]?
Emphasis on [QUOTE]You[QUOTE] and [QUOTE]I[QUOTE] in the first sentence.
The Lexicon had better be worth all this trouble.
I assure you, it is. The knowledge contained in the Lexicon created everything you see around you.
You sure that's power we're meant to have?
Drennen!
Let the field mouse run. Your pay will be double.
My pay will be nothing if we die in here!
Calm yourself, Breya. We are closing in on the Lexicon. I can feel it calling. We'll continue without Drennen.
We are close now. Can you hear the Lexicon calling out?
So we grab it and we get out, right?
Once we have the Lexicon, we'll need to take it to its podium. I know what to do from there. Soon the Lexicon's knowledge will be mine.
emphasizes [QUOTE]ours[QUOTE] both times
We're almost there. I can hear the Lexicon. Come on. Quickly!
Something doesn't feel right.
Death Scream
I have the Lexicon! Where's the podium?
I can't hold these things! We need to leave!
I did not come all the way here just to walk out empty-handed.
The way out is right there! Run, damn it!
Yes, Yes. It is an ancient and ruined city. Built by the Dwemer. The dwarf folk. It is nearby, but I'd stay clear. People say it is quite dangerous.
You think I'd be in hiding if this was something I trusted town guards to handle?
These men are ruthless. Cunning, deceitful... they'll pay off whoever they can. I can't trust anyone here in Whiterun.
Guards and Jarls can be bought. And the Alik'r are close; I'm running out of time, so I'm choosing to trust you.
I don't know for sure. I spoke out against the Aldmeri Dominion publicly; I suspect that's why these men were hired to hunt me down.
a warning
you were being ignored
Let me put it to you this way.
I've already said too much.
I gave you what you came here for, now go. Leave me in peace.
Give it your best shot!
No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!
That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.
Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.
Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.
Keep doing right by us and there's plenty more where that came from.
Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
she's pretty sure you're lying
My sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure she'd help you out.
You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight to free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.

I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable.
Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.
Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material he could on locations the Guild could heist.
Museums, keeps, estates... you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen.

Look, you've already been told you're not allowed here. Turn around and go back the way you came.
We're causing no trouble. All we ask is to look for her.
I don't care what you're doing, after what happened you're lucky I don't toss you in jail. Now get lost.
We will be back. This is not over.
The College of Winterhold is an amazing sight. I've never set foot on the grounds, but always wanted to.
The Forsworn haven't been kind to Karthwasten. I've heard rumors that they've attacked this place without mercy.
I grew up in The Pale. This land was my home for most of my life... and for a Dunmer, that's quite a statement, I assure you.
We should bow our heads in silent reverence for those who are interred in Falkreath's cemetery.
I've always wanted to make a pilgrimage here to the Temple of Mara. Thank you for bringing me here... you've made me quite happy.
Watch your step, Markarth has quite a reputation thanks to the Silver-Blood family. I wouldn't advise crossing them.
What an amazing city. I've actually never managed to visit Whiterun, but I always wanted to.
Windhelm is absolutely freezing. How can these people tolerate it?
I was a student at the Bards College for a short time... until my affiliation with Vaermina was discovered. I haven't been back to Solitude since.
I've heard Riften's home to the worst Skyrim has to offer. I hope we don't run into any trouble while we're here.
Her Benevolence has taught me patience and mercy, but these vampires deserve none of it.
A good friend of mine was infected by a vampire long ago. He killed himself rather than change into one of those... things.
Vampires are utter abominations. We need to do everything in our power to destroy them.
Being a priest of Vaermina put me very close to dark sorcery at its worst.
Let's try and stay together, the sorcerers in these places tend to... well, harvest bodies for parts.
I've seen my share of black magic, but that's all in the past now.
This place must be cleansed. These draugr were once living beings and they deserve better.
These poor souls... suffering in eternal servitude.
The thought of the dead rising... makes me sick to my stomach.
Bandits know nothing of pity or mercy. No need to show them any either.
A group of bandits descended on Dawnstar once... if it wasn't for the guard, who knows what they could have done to the place.
Bandits are the worst lot. They'd steal from their own mothers given the chance.
I thought I heard footsteps. Be careful.
When I was a young acolyte of Vaermina, I paid my dues in a shrine located within the catacombs of a fort in Cyrodiil.
I served as a healer in a fort not unlike this one long ago.
I can't imagine what happened to the dwarves. How could a race with the capability to build a place like this simply vanish?
I've never been inside a dwarven ruin. They are simply astounding.
Did you hear that? A metal on stone sound... hmmm, perhaps it was nothing.
This place could be massive... very easy to get lost. We have to be careful not to lose our way.
What a marvel of engineering. The ancient Nords were ingenious builders.
Ugh, this place... horrible.
Watch yourself, these Nordic ruins are notorious for their traps.
These ruins are old, maybe a thousand years or more.
Why anything would chose to reside down here is beyond me.
alerted, concerned
Trust in Mara... she'll protect us in this dark place.
I don't like the looks of this place... not at all.
I don't know what persuaded you to assist me when we met in Dawnstar, but I'm glad you did.
I've done a lot of... questionable things in my life. Serving Vaermina was a horrible mistake, and I hope Mara will forgive me one day.
I was recruited as an acolyte of Vaermina as a young elf. I had no real childhood to speak of... we weren't permitted to socialize.
I've always felt a great deal of guilt running from Nightcaller Temple and leaving my friends to die. I'll never forgive myself for that.
After running from Nightcaller Temple, I wandered Skyrim for years until I was taken in by a priest of Mara who lived in Morthal.
Finding Mara was the greatest moment of my life. I'll never forget the warmth that spread through my heart when we embraced.
It was a bit difficult to come to the ways of Mara at first, but my fellow priests were kind and quite patient with me.
I've never admitted this before, but I've killed more than I care to admit. I'll just leave it at that.
My parents are long dead, but they lived wonderful lives... I have no sad stories to tell about them. Perhaps one day I'll visit their resting place.
I've been enjoying this journey with you. Not for the wealth we've accumulated, but just being carry Mara's will to every corner of Skyrim.
It's wonderful to be able to sleep soundly, don't you think?
The Greybeards are an amazing lot. Imagine, living your entire life without speaking to a friend or a loved one. I couldn't stand it.
I've been to Ivarstead a few times, but never climbed High Hrothgar. I wouldn't mind visiting the monastery at the summit.
When the weather permitted, Aerin and I would often walk the Rift's forests. The trees here are so beautiful.
Ah, Winterhold. I've always wanted to visit this place. The secrets locked inside must be astounding.
Incredible... imagine the manpower and ingenuity needed to carve the buildings of Markarth.
Whiterun is a such beautiful city. Have you ever seen the likes of this place?
reminiscing
It feels good to walk the streets of Riften again.
Vampires... an unclean lot. It will be a pleasure to clear this place.
Don't let the vampires strike you or else you may get infected with their blood poisoning.
Be aware of rune traps on the ground or else this could be a very short expedition.
Kill these casters as fast as you can, otherwise they may summon creatures we don't want to deal with.
Ugh... dark sorcery. Always makes my skin crawl.
If there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that draugr burn like tinder. We could use that to our advantage.
Many have fallen in this crypt. The Draugr show no mercy.
Ugh, Draugr. They reek of decay.
a painful memory makes you angry
I hope there's more bandits around... their numbers could use a little more thinning.
These bandits would stab each other in the back if it meant an extra coin in their pockets.
Bandits... the worst type of scum.
Perhaps we can find some treasure if we search the grounds of the fort thoroughly.
If fought more than my share of bandits in places like this.
Keep your eyes open for ambushes. These forts have too many blind corners.
These are the most dangerous, but the most profitable types of ruins. The dwarves must have been a prosperous race.
Watch the walls for the sphere constructs... they can appear in the blink of an eye.
The dwarves were masters at subterranean construction... these ruins show  only a fraction of their capabilities.
Mzinchaleft. I swore I'd never return here.
I almost died in a ruin just like this.
Danger's about, I can tell. Be cautious.
Can you just imagine how ancient this place must be? Hundreds of years? Thousands?
There could be Draugr about, I can smell the decay in the air.
I've ventured into quite a few Nord ruins in my day.
Killed my first creature in a cave just like this... I'll never forget it.
I'm certain we'll find some treasure down here.
Keep your eyes open, I don't like the looks of this place.
Exploring these caves feels like coming home. I missed this.
I've really missed traveling like this. Walking the breadth of Skyrim has always filled my heart with excitement.
I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.
You should have seen me at the height of my adventuring career... I was fearless and took too many risks. But that's what it was all about.
I've seen enough death to last three lifetimes, yet I never tire of a good fight. What do you make of that?
When I was young, I'd journey with my father on hunting expeditions into Morrowind. The cliff racers made for excellent sport.
I love the cold air... it's exhilarating. Perhaps it's because of my Nord blood, but there's something about it that makes me feel alive.
sad reminiscing
My mother was a strong woman... she's the one who instructed me on my swordfighting techniques. Can you imagine?
People say Skyrim is one of the most dangerous places in Tamriel. I think they're wrong... it's magnificent and I'm proud to call it home.
As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth.
There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.
I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this.
Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.
By the Nine, I'd pay good money for a pint of ale to warm my bones!
Curse this chill! I should have dressed more warmly.
If this cold numbs my fingers any worse, I'll scarcely be able to hold a weapon.
Gods, I'd hate to lose my footing in a place like this. A fall on this stony floor will break bones.
This cold is unbearable. It's all I can do not to shiver until my teeth rattle.
Would it be foolish to stop for a while and light a fire? I suppose it would.
Gods willing, we'll find a chest full of gold in one of these chambers.
At times like this, I truly appreciate the joys of a warm fire and a stiff drink.
There are strange echoes in these caves. Keep you eyes open.
If a man can't feel at home in a freezing cave, then he isn't truly a Nord.
I have to admit, I admire your courage. Most folk in Skyrim wouldn't go near a place like this.
When I was a boy, my friends and I used to play [QUOTE]seek the wumpus[QUOTE] in caves much like this.

In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford.
I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.
These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.
The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be.
The cloying air in this place is almost unbearable.
By the gods, let this mine be small so we can be done with it quickly.
My nose and mouth are so full of dust, I can hardly breath.
Wouldn't it be something if we found a vein of gold?
It would be easy for someone -- or something -- to sneak up on us down here.
Not for all the gold in Skyrim would I spend my life working in these tunnels.
I've heard that miners sometimes die from poisonous gases trapped beneath the ground.
I'm already looking forward to getting back above ground.
You know what I miss the most right now? Fresh air.
It takes uncommon strength to work the mines in Skyrim. The earth here is cold and hard, like the heart of a Nord.
There's an old maid's tale that says our ancestors dug these mines with their bare hands.
I've half a mind to grab a pickaxe and start digging. Never know what you might find.
It seems warmer down here than it was outside.
Hard to believe people actually have to work in places like this.
Wonder what they mine from these walls.
I'll take a sword or mace over a pick axe any day.
Do you think we'll find gold nuggets in here?
It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.
I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.
Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage.
Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.
They say ruins like these are filled with treasure. Of course, they're filled with traps, too.
I could have sworn I heard something right behind us.
I'll bet some of these artifacts would fetch a good price. I hope they're not cursed.
I wonder what the ancient Nords did in these ruins. Unspeakable sacrifices, maybe?
Remember to check behind you every once in a while. Who knows what might try to sneak up on us.
Keep your eyes open for traps. Old ruins like this are usually filled with them.
The ancient Nords were a savage people, but they built some remarkable crypts and temples.
There's a lot of history in a place like that. I'll bet these walls could tell some amazing stories.
Look at this craftsmanship! These old halls fill some folk with dread, but as a Nord, they fill me with pride.
We're bound to find some gold in these ruins, but out of respect, let's leave a few coins for the dead.
It's strange to think that some of my own ancestors might be buried in here.
Plunder these ruins at your peril, friend. The spirits of the dead won't look kindly upon it.
Wonder if any of my ancestors ever walked these halls?
Everything in here seems to be about death. Burial urns, crypts, funeral shrouds. It's a bit depressing.
I wonder what the ancient nords used this place for?
The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans.
There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.
It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.
There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.
What good is a sword or an axe against an enemy made of brass and steel?
It's unnatural, building all these machines. If you ask me, the Dwemer got what they deserved.
I don't like fighting these Dwemer creations. Where's the fun in killing something that doesn't even bleed?
Watch out for the hot steam vents down here. They'll burn you worse than fire.
The Dwemer created so many wondrous machines, and yet nobody ever followed in their footsteps. Why is that, I wonder?
Among other things, the Dwemer were expert trap-makers. Watch the floor for tripwires and false plates.
I've half a mind to dismantle one of these Dwemer machines. I'd like to see how it works.
I suppose the warmth in this place comes from all the hot steam vents.
Scholars say the Dwemer were an advanced culture. Ha! The Nords outlasted their entire race. So much for being advanced.
I wonder why the Dwemer came to Skyrim. Why did they build this place? I suppose we'll never know.
Do these steel walls and strange Dwemer devices make you uneasy? Perhaps it's just me.
I've heard that you can sell Dwemer artifacts on the black market down in Cyrodiil. They fetch a handsome price, too.
The stories don't say why the dwarves disappeared. I wonder if their machines turned on them.
So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.
Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.
Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it.
I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.
If it wasn't for all the dangers in here, this place could almost be cozy.
When I was a child, I dreamed about having a fort like this all to myself.
I wonder if we'll come across some bandits who've just finished roasting a rabbit on a spit. Maybe they'll have a keg of ale, too.
If my ma could see me now, she'd scold me good. She'd tell me I should know better than to go poking around in abandoned forts.
These timber supports are rotted through. It's a wonder this place is still standing.
Check every crate, chest and barrel you see. Who knows, maybe a few of them have something valuable inside.
Did you bring a torch? These old forts can get pretty dark inside.
There are forts like this all over Skyrim. The Imperials abandoned most of them a long time ago.
Just look at this place. I've seen better workmanship from Nord children only ten winters old.
So this is what passes for Imperial craftsmanship. Try not to sneeze, or you might bring the whole fort down.
What is that stench? Rotting wood, perhaps? That can't be good.
You'd have to be pretty desperate to want to make a home in this dank hole.
The Jarls never want to pay to keep the forts. They just keep slipping further into ruin.
I wonder what great battles were fought here?
Do you think Tiber Septim ever fought here?
I can see why they built the fort here. A small force could control most of the nearby land.
Outlaws and brigands are the lowest of the low. They prey on their own countrymen for profit.
I hope that when I die, I don't end up as a shambling corpse.
The Forsworn are as wild as wolves. Practice those old magics, so some folk say.
Wizards. Why is it always wizards.
It isn't just your blood that a vampire wants, it's your mortal soul.
Fighting draugr is as much about controlling your fear as anything else.
Most bandits are cowards. These seem to be braver than most.
These wizards are mad beyond reason. They understand only violence.
There is no greater madness than those who seek to become vampires. That's a dark bargain if there ever was one.
You can easily break a blade on the metal skin of a Dwemer construct.
I hate bandits and thieves. Men like these raid our town every year.
The Forsworn are strange men. They fight to reclaim Markarth, but they live like savages.
I don't like wizards and their spells. Give me an axe any day.
I'd rather fight bandits than draugr. At least bandits know when to stay dead.
Taken alone, the draugr aren't so fearsome. They're far more deadly in greater numbers.
These Forsworn are just savages. They live in caves and ruins when civilized folk build towns and cities.
You can't argue with these mages. They'll attack you on sight.
It probably took some Dwemer craftsman a year to build one of those things.
There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.
I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.
These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.
It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic.
There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.
Don't get too far ahead.
Pleased enough, I suppose. At least they appreciate the ways and traditions of the Nord people.
Can't say I ever much liked the idea of the Empire telling us what to do an' how to do it.
Angry and stubborn
Twice I've been robbed, and good luck getting any kind of justice from Vignar now that he's the Jarl. He probably told the Stormcloaks to do it.
Disbelief, incredulity, anger
Anger, resignation
I'm sure my brother Vignar is, since they made him Jarl after throwing Balgruuf out.
Comes the end of the day, Imperials and Stormcloaks ain't much different.
Both sides want to tell you how you should live your life. Guess I'd rather hear it from a real Nord than some Emperor down south.
Cheerful, exultant, almost theatrical
If the gods are merciful, they've found a safe place to hide in the city.
I hope Vignar doesn't find them. He'll ask a king's ransom, I'm sure.
If it's the war you're referring to, I'm on the side of Whiterun.
No doubt General Tullius and his friends in the Empire will tell you that I owe them my loyalty, and perhaps I do.
Ulfric Stormcloak would say that I owe my allegiance to the Nord people as they fight for Skyrim's independence. Perhaps this is also true.
The day might come when I am forced to draw my sword for one side or the other.
Finality, resignation.
No doubt he thought it was the only way to make his point. And also because he knew he could.
The gold, the jewels... it's all gone.
That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!
telling someone to sheath weapon
calming down from anger, but determined
Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.
Are you all right? What happened in there?
By the Nine...
Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead?
There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe.
Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!
shaken, scared
But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right.
I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!
He's my son. I just... I feel it in my heart. You'd understand if you had children.
You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.
Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!
No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand.
Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?
I have Gallus's journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.
what you're looking at doesn't make any sense
stunned/puzzled
There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.
It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses.
still can't believe it
That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.
out loud but almost to self
What's she on about?
Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth.
I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours.
A bit worried, and speaking so others can't overhear
speaking so others can't overhear
Are you finished your other business and ready to face the Guild?
Then we show them Gallus's journal and hope for the best.
Remember, we have proof and all he's got is his word.
A bit annoyed
It's hardly a secret that they have ties to the Empire, and hate anyone who speaks out against it.
Thorald did worse. He took action against the Empire, and the Battle-Borns knew it.
The Battle-Borns. The Emperor's biggest boot-lickers here in Whiterun.
Their connections to the Empire and the Legion are well-known. When Thorald didn't return home, there was no question in my mind.
They knew Thorald supported the Stormcloaks, knew he was going to aid them in battle. Made sure he didn't come back.
Locked him up someplace to get back at my family. I'm sure of it.
Bloody enough for you, outsider?
Markarth. Is it bloody enough for you?
Then turn around and go back where you came. City doesn't need you, doesn't want you.
Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. That's the way it is. That's the way it'll stay.
Then you've found your home, friend. Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth. Welcome.
If I was threatening you, believe me, you'd know it.
You outsiders never learn. If the Forsworn don't get you, the guards will throw you in Cidhna Mine to work your fingers off.
Think that's water in the river? Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth, friend.
Been here ever since I left the Bards College. Turns out a few muscles earn more gold than a damn lute.
The Silver-Bloods pay me, let me crack a few skulls, and keep the guards off my back. That's all I need.
Jarl is who you want to talk to. Always coin to be made killing off some Forsworn in the hills.
As long as you don't mind going axe-to-axe with a bunch of Daedra-worshipping savages who practice the dark arts.
It's right there in the name of the most powerful family in Markarth. The Silver-Bloods.
They have a whole mine filled with prisoners to dig up silver ore, gets smelted by workers they pay, and they own half the city.
I work for them. The inn is named after them. When the guards make an arrest, they check with them first.
Why are you bothering me, kinsman?
Why are you bothering me, outsider?
Then you're talking to the wrong man. You want that elf in the keep. Calcelmo.
The only thing I'll tell you about Markarth is stay out of our business. We have enough around here without some outsider causing trouble.
I don't. Go bother Kleppr at the Silver-Blood Inn, he handles the newcomers.
And by Ysmir, if you find work, just do what you're told. There's enough trouble in Markarth already.
That's about the only harmless thing you can do in this city. Silver-Blood Inn is the place to go.
And once you've had your fill of mead, do us all a favor and go home. Markarth has enough trouble.
Grew up in a stronghold. Every Orc girl tended the forge at some point.
But a girl has to grow up, and life in the stronghold asked for a lot in return, so I joined the Legion. Mastered my trade there.
That's right. An Orc stronghold. Kept to ourselves. Lived as our ancestors would have wanted.
Wasn't enough for me, though. I left. Didn't want to end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain.
You strike your metal like a new mother giving her babe a light slap. Hit it harder.
I'm sorry, Ghorza. I just... flinch, and uh....
If you can't pound the dusk out of your iron, it'll break when it's finished. Hit. It. Harder.
What am I supposed to do? Never leave the house? You want that, Endon?
You're closing the stall, and that's final.
You want to give up now? Out of fear? Is that what we're teaching our daughter?
Mama, why are you and papa fighting?
We're not fighting we're just.... Why don't I get you something to eat? Mama and papa will talk later.
Think we should buy more horses next season?
I'd rather spend the gold on a new litter of pups, but the horses bring in more gold.
How are the new breeds getting along with my dogs?
Haven't attacked each other yet. Good a sign as any.
Sure, what can I do for you?
For a generous fellow traveler? But of course. What would you like to hear?
Sorry friend, but it looks like you're a bit light in the purse, and the wayward minstrel can't afford to do free performances.
Sure, my voice could use a rest.
Well all right, then.
Would you now?
Well, spit it out. What's the matter?
Bah! Stop wasting my time!
What about him?
Nobody pilfers property on my watch.
My thanks for bringing this to my attention, citizen. Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
How dare that little fool! And right under my nose!
An assault. On my watch. By the gods, he'll not get away with this.
Ha ha! Oh, I knew I had a good feeling about you!

We don't just take in any milk drinker who stumbles in. Talk to Kodlak if you think you have what it takes to be a Companion.
I don't know if you're capable, and I don't have time to find out. If Kodlak will vouch for you, I might have some work you could do.
Kodlak is the one who figures out who can be a Companion. So talk to him. It's out of my hands.
So you think you have what it takes? Huh. Lucky for you, I'm not the one who makes that decision. Talk to Kodlak.
Who knows, maybe he's in a generous mood.

I sell my catch across a good portion of Skyrim... it's worth its weight in gold to me.
The only untapped market left is Markarth. However, I just got word that Kleppr at The Silver Blood Inn might be interested.
If you're headed that way, I would appreciate you delivering a purchase agreement for me. You'd be paid, of course.
Good. Kleppr will pay you as soon as you arrive with the letter. Here you are.
Ah, Bolli finally got someone out here. Well it's about time. I've been waiting for weeks.
Well, thank you for bringing it I suppose. Have a good day.
pretending to be flustered
Here you are. So sorry about that.
If you must know, I was practicing in the yard when the guard I was sparring with feinted when I specifically told him to duck!
My blade bit right into the stonework next to the keep and needed serious repairs. Thankfully our smith Balimund works wonders.
In fact, if you'd fetch my blade from him I'd be most appreciative.
Thank you. Do hurry please.
Hmph. I should have known better than to ask a knave.
Took your sweet time getting it to me.
Here you go, for your trouble.
Lazy good-for-nothing, isn't he? Sent you down here when I'm a stone's throw from the keep?
Agh! Bother and befuddle! Stuck here! Stuck! My mother, my poor mother. Unmoving. At rest, but too still!
The farmer is at his farm! Where else would he be? Loreius is his name. Talk to him. Convince him to help poor Cicero.
Poor mother... she's been waiting here so long... Stupid farmer and his stupid tools! Why won't he help us?
Poor mother... Her new home seems so very far...
Unfair! Unjust! Cicero has done nothing wrong! Loreius will pay for his treachery! Oh, how he will pay... And you! You were no help! Not at all!
I will wait for Loreius! Oh yes, mother and I will wait right here, right here until he fixes our wheel.
Oh, for the love of Mara. What now?
You need to report that crazy jester to the guard. He should be patrolling the road.
I thought we'd talked enough. Unless you've reconsidered my offer? That Cicero needs sortin'...
Well? Is it done? Have you reported the fool to the guard?
Ha! That'll teach the little jester to go bothering the decent, hardworking folk of Skyrim. Fool never should have come here.
Little fool's going to experience the hard reality of Skyrim justice, eh?
You can tell Cicero I'll be along presently. I just need to do a couple things here first, and gather my tools.
Just need to gather my tools and finish up a couple of things. No worries - I'll see to Cicero, make sure that wagon gets fixed.
You need something?
You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds...
Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed.
I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done.
You need something talk to my husband. Vantus Loreius. Or just Loreius, if it's all the same to you.
That Cicero feller?
Hmph. Tell me something I don't know. Crazy fool's already asked me about five times. Seems he's not satisfied with my answer.
Why can't he just leave us alone?
angry, starting to lose his temper and his voice
Or maybe you missed the demented little man in the jester's garb, down by the road? Goes by the name of Cicero?
Crazy fool's asked me to fix his broken wagon wheel five times. He won't take no for an answer. Why can't he just leave us alone?
Pay me? You think this is about money?
Have you seen the man? He's completely out of his head. A jester? Here, in Skyrim? Ain't been a merryman in these parts for a hundred years.
And he's transporting some giant box. Says it's a coffin, and he's going to bury his mother. Mother my eye.
He could have anything in there. War contraband. Weapons. Skooma. Ain't no way I'm getting involved in any of that.
Well, there is something. There's a guard, patrols the road that crazy jester is on. He passes by pretty often.
You could report the fool. You know, say he's done something against the law. That will at least get rid of him for me. What do you say?
And just who in Mara's name are you, anyway? Hmm? Come here, telling me my business. And for what? To help a... a... a fool!
Hmph. Fine. Suit yourself. But you're wrong, anyway. Just look at the fool. I don't know what it is, but he's damn well guilty of something.
Ha! Wonderful!
Like I said, the guard is down by the road. You really can't miss him.
You tell him that jester is up to no good, and he'll deal with it. Then come back here, and I'll toss a few coins your way, yeah?
Poor Cicero is stuck. Can't you see? I was transporting my dear, sweet mother. Well, not her. Her corpse! She's quite dead.
I'm taking mother to a new home. A new crypt. But... aggh! Wagon wheel! Damnedest wagon wheel! It broke! Don't you see?
Oh. Oh yes! Yes, the kindly stranger can certainly help!
Go to the farm - the Loreius Farm. Just over there, off the road. Talk to Loreius. He has tools! He can help me! But he won't! He refuses!
Convince Loreius to fix my wheel! Do that, and poor Cicero will reward you. With coin! Gleamy, shiny coin!
You... you did? He has?
Oh stranger! You have made Cicero so happy! So jubilant and ecstatic! But more! Even more! My mother thanks you!
Here, here. For your troubles! Shiny, clinky gold! A few coins for a kind deed! And thank you! Thank you again.
Have you met my husband? Well don't bother, he's a drunk.
He promised me, swore on his ancestors, that he'd give up the mead. And what do I find out? He's been stashing drink in a cave nearby.
He even has some wolves guarding it. I swear, I should just cut out his tongue. That would be the end of it.
If you want to try, but I'll keep my dagger sharpened just in case.
You can help yourself to any drink you find, but bring me the bottle of Dragon's Breath Mead. It's his favorite, so I know he has one there.
It's not luck, it's mead I'm cursing.
Stendarr's Mercy to you. If my Horgeir doesn't give up the mead this time, I'll hit him over the head with it.
Here, for your trouble.
Shor's Crown, that woman never gives up. I guess that's why I married her.
You're a real friend saving this mead from her. Here, let me show you how to block a punch that might be coming from some angry spouse, huh?
We'd be better off without the Silver-Bloods. They send their brute, Yngvar, to shake some coins from me every few days.
And Betrid Silver-Blood is always asking for more potions to fuel Thonar's [QUOTE]ambitions.[QUOTE] Gives him a temper fiercer than any bear.
When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared the worst. Are you all right?

overly excited
trying to cheer Frodnar up
Now, Ralof, what's going on? You two look pretty well done in.
settling gratefully into a chair
Where to start? Well, the news you heard about Ulfric was true. The Imperials ambushed us outside Darkwater Crossing.
Like they knew exactly where we'd be. That was... two days ago, now.
We stopped in Helgen this morning, and I thought it was all over. Had us lined up to the headsman's block and ready to start chopping.
The cowards!
Nodding in agreement
But then... out of nowhere... a dragon attacked...
When your friend told me, I didn't believe it at first either.
trailing off in disbelief and amazement
sharp intake of breath -- surprise and amazement -- [QUOTE]wha??[QUOTE]
with an attempt at a smile
As strange as it sounds, we'd be dead if not for that dragon. In the confusion, we managed to slip away.
Are we really the first to make it to Riverwood?
Nobody else has come up the south road today, as far as I know.
Good. Maybe we can lay up for a while. I hate to put your family in danger, Gerdur, but...
Nonsense. You and your friend are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.
Any friend of Ralof's is a friend of mine.
Mind your mother, boy!
expansively
affectionately
Good luck, brother. I'll see you later.
I told you my sister would help us out.
I hope to see you in Windhelm. Good luck.
Come on. I'll feel better once we're under cover in Riverwood.
Do you think that dragon is still flying around here somewhere?
I almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...
hopefully
I bet my uncle Ralof is tougher than you are.
warmly
Thanks, sister. I knew we could count on you.
I ought to get back to work before I'm missed, but... did anyone else escape? Did Ulfric...
Don't worry. I'm sure he made it out. It'll take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.
Because big, bad Brynjolf doesn't like the way I play thief.
Look, he says we needed coin, so I got coin. Who cares if people got hurt? Blood washes off septims.
Now I'm sitting in here counting skeever droppings while he's drinking Black-Briar mead with Maven.
Hey, if you're in good with Maven you've pretty much got it made.
She's got friends in high places, and I don't just mean in Skyrim.
So getting the guards to throw me in here as a [QUOTE]punishment[QUOTE] was about as easy as falling off a log.
Got into a scrap a few years ago at the Ragged Flagon. Some idiot who stole himself a guard's sword and kept boasting about it.
He's making too much racket and I'm trying to get Vex drunk. So I tell him to keep it down and he just runs me through.
trail off at end of line
Anyway, after I got back to the Guild, I decided to start calling myself Twice-Killed.
chuckle at end obnoxiously
Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.
Why are you standing here then?
I've told the captain of the guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.
Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?

Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!
Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got.
Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.
How's it going? You find anything yet?
Keep looking. There's got to be some way to get that gate open.
Alright, let's move, men! We've got more...
Steady, legionnaires! We've been through worse. Just keep your guard up!
Follow me. Let's see where this leads.
Hadvar... get away from there!
We'll stay here and see if we can find anything else that could be of use.
There's no time! You have to get back to the College as fast as you can!
Mirabelle is dead, and they're losing ground fast. I'd be there now if I hadn't seen... I had one of your 'visions', I think.

There's some trouble in Eastmarch. Farmers getting troubled by some bad types who've built up a stronghold in the area.
There's some trouble in Falkreath. There's always some sort of trouble down there, but now it's come to a head.
There's some trouble in Haafingar. The Legion's too busy with the war, and they're hiring us to take care of their problems.
We've been hired to deal with some pests in Hjaalmarch. Someone's got them riled up, and you need to put an end to it.
There's some trouble in The Pale. We need you to go in and clear out an enemy stronghold.
There's always some sort of trouble in The Reach, but a local warlord has raised the stakes. We have to handle the situation.
The Rift is seeing a lot of trouble from some riff-raff. We need to head in and break them up.
We've got trouble right here in Whiterun Hold. Nothing we can't handle.
There's trouble up in Winterhold. I'm a little surprised anyone's complaining about it, but money is money.
Nothing but a bunch of lowly bandits. Cowards, who will take little effort.

The Falmer. There have been reports that they've been attacking people at night.
It's a problem with the Forsworn. Unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous. Be careful.
It's a clan of giants. The war is driving them out of their lands, and they've started attacking settlements.
You'll be clearing a nest of those Hagraven things. I've never faced one myself, but I hear... disturbing things about them.
Oddly enough, Spriggans. Usually they let alone, but for some reason, this particular grove isn't.
Bloodsuckers. Vampires. Take every precaution. One bite, and you could end up as one of them.
Rogue wizards. I've never trusted magic types. The College is bad enough. Destroy them.
I knew you could be counted on. Do what must be done.
Excellent. Show them no mercy.
Good. Do not spare them your blade.
Shame. But, I'm sure one of the whelps around here will take it up.
And I have already received word that the client is satisfied. You have done well for yourself, and for the Companions.
I expected no less of you. And once again, you have not disappointed.
We've received a desperate missive.
Unfortunate. Let's be more careful next time.
So I hear. You've brought honor to the Companions and yourself.
Thank the Divines! Let's move!
I'm ever so grateful. Please, give my regard to the rest of the Companions.
Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener.

What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's tomb! Explain yourself!
Good work. The mindless cretins didn't stand a chance.
Not bad, not bad. The intensity of the hunt is special, isn't it?
Good to hear. Have your share of the pay.
I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone!
He treats me like a slave... I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.
Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery.
There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over.
I've already removed the boards so the meadery would get infested. That's where you should start.
Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.
I love it when a plan comes together.
Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.
Good luck. I'll be here if you need me.
Please hurry. The Captain of the Guard isn't patient when it comes to tasting time.
Now I've got to clean up this mess.
Remember, you don't get paid until they're all dead.
One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.
Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back.
Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out.
Are you kidding me? Look at this place.
If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.
Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back.

You've got to help me! Please!
I don't know where I'll go. Somewhere far away from here.
Maybe this is a way out?
Maybe one of the guards had a key?
There's got to be some way out of here!
Oh... thank you. I don't understand what's happening. I can't stay here. What will I do now?
What? Why? But... you must have said something to Erikur! You lied to him and now here I am! You're a heartless monster!
No... please, you have to help me! You don't understand what they do to people here!
Go. Out. Before I change my mind.

Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?
It is. We train the bards you hear throughout the land. Viarmo is the head of the college and in charge of admissions.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work at here at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
Only in that I'm a graduate. I work over at the Winking Skeever. I would highly recommend it though. Talk to Viarmo if you're interested.
I'm a bard, trained at the Bards College in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.
I'm a bard, from the Bards College here in Solitude. Wanderers like you should think about applying.
At the Bards College in Solitude. They train bards and skalds like myself.
If you go there, talk to Viarmo. He's the headmaster.
Always a pleasure to meet a prospective bard.
You should be aware that many apply but we accept very few people.
When possible, we ask applicants to perform tasks the college needs completed. In this case, I do have a task befitting an aspiring bard...
As you may be aware Elisif's husband High King Torygg was recently killed.
Elisif mourns her husband deeply and she feels that a festival that burns a King in effigy is... distasteful.
I've tried to convince her the festival is many centuries old and celebrates Solitude but I need proof.
I believe King Olaf's verse will provide that proof.
Elisif has forbidden the Burning of King Olaf, a Festival put on by the Bards College. We need to change her mind.
To convince her I want to read King Olaf's Verse. A part of the Poetic Edda, the living history of Skyrim. Unfortunately the verse was lost long ago.
I have to admit I didn't think it would actually be there.  Now let's take a look at this...
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all.
The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.
And the parts that are readable... well... bardic verse has come a long way since ancient times.
You're excited.
I'll let Viarmo take possession but I will be looking forward to adding this to our library. Good work.
That's tremendous! I have to admit I didn't fully believe it still existed. Now let's take a look at this...
Oh. Oh-no. This won't do at all. The copy is incomplete, it's aged to the point that parts are unreadable.
I knew it was at the Dead Man's Respite.
It means I can't read it to the court. Without the verse I won't be able to convince Elisif of the importance of The Burning of King Olaf Festival.
If she isn't convinced of the festival's importance then she won't reverse her decision to stop the effigy burning.
It means that the Burning of King Olaf, which the Bards College has held for time immemorial, won't be happening.
Make it up? That doesn't seem appropriate...
I suppose I could copy his style based on what you brought me but I have no idea what happened in between these verses.
It has a few final lines but that's all we needed to add. I need to head to court immediately and present this. You should come.

I thank you and the college thanks you, Jarl.
You have proven your point, Viarmo.  The festival is truly a celebration of Solitude and a condemnation of false kings.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be moderately rewarded.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be generously rewarded.
Furthermore, I believe that such a fine poem deserves some payment of Patronage. The college will be very generously rewarded.
Thank you yet again. I will make sure our applicant, who was instrumental in... recovering the poem will be well rewarded.
Unbelievable! You have done us a great service here. I can't begin to thank you enough.
Soon, soon. These things must be done properly, you will be inducted as part of the Festival itself.
I need you to go speak to Jorn. He was preparing the Effigy of King Olaf.
Tell him to finish the preparations, the Festival is back on.
I think they like you.
You're leaving? Okay, we'll just work on the verse in a bit.
Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart.
If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off limits.
That's the best I can offer.
I've already provided you a key to the museum. You should consider it an honor. Few are allowed to browse my collection.
I'm sorry, but that's as far as my generosity extends.

First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it.
See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way.
Jarl Igmund sits on the Mournful Throne. You can find him in the keep, in the back end of the city inside the mountain.
You're our favorite kind of traveler, then. The market area is just inside in the gate.
Head on in. Keep your nose clean, and you won't have any problems with us.

under his breathe
Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.
Because Calcelmo doesn't want anyone to go in. He runs the museum, he makes the rules.
You have a problem with that? Go talk to him. You'll find him in front of the ruins during the day. Just down the tunnel.
Calcelmo. He's the Jarl's magical advisor, but he spends most of his time studying the ruins.
If you want in, Calcelmo has to give his say-so. He's usually in front of Nchuand-Zel. Just down the tunnel.
It means [QUOTE]Dwarven Museum.[QUOTE] Lost race of people that built the city.
You want to know more? Ask Calcelmo. He's usually in front of the ruins, just down the tunnel.
Correct. It's a private place where I can catalog my research. Occasionally, the Jarl will come in and have questions, but that's thankfully rare.
Persistent aren't you? Oh, very well. Who am I to stand in the way of curiosity?
I'll let you in if you agree to something for me. There's a giant spider in Nchuand-Zel. My workers call her [QUOTE]Nimhe,[QUOTE] the poisoned one.
If you deal with Nimhe, I'll let you into both the excavation site and my Dwemer Museum. What do you say?
Enthusiasm. Good. Here's the key to the dig site.
Oh, very well. Probably safest that way.
You have my gratitude. That spider had been interfering with my excavations for months.
As promised, here's the key to the Dwemer Museum. Mind the displays. Some of them are quite fragile.
Look, we all have our flaws; mine is that women can't get enough of me.
So I had this little affair going on while I was betrothed to a beautiful girl named Svidi.
Well, she finds out and she tells her brother, Wulfur. Then her brother attacks me with a knife... I mean, I had to defend myself!
Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?
I was about to let that wench marry into the richest family in Riften, and this is how she repays me.
I'd do anything to have that whore's head on a platter. All I need to know is where she is.
Scared
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
Good, good. Just point me in the right direction and I'll do the rest.
Ivarstead? So close to Riften? She's an even bigger fool than I thought.
So, the whore thinks the Black-Briar reach ends at the border of Skyrim, eh? She'll soon discover her mistake.
No, no friend. You've got it all wrong. I'm not selling cheap mead. I'm selling good mead for cheap... Black-Briar Mead.
I sell cases of it for half of what the inns and taverns pay through the Meadery.
All I need is someone to deliver it for me. If anyone saw me leave Riften, they'd get suspicious.
I need someone to take this small keg of Black-Briar Mead to Wilhelm at the Vilemyr Inn in Ivarstead.
Drop it off and he'll trade you something for the delivery. Keep it as payment for the legwork.
Oh, and if you bump into Indaryn from the meadery, keep your mouth shut. He'd rat us out in a second.
All right, pipe down. You want the whole blessed place to hear you?
The arrangement called for a trade. I hope you'll find this suitable.
You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer.
this is a big revelation to the Player
Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher.
Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.
I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon.
In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve.
I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me.
I think given time, you'll understand what I mean.
Aye, I suspected as much but I've never been able to catch that little sneak with proof.
That fetcher! I gave him the same keg just this morning and told him to store it in the cellars.
Oh, he'll rot in prison for this one I promise you. As soon as Maven finds out, it's all over for him.
Here, take this as a bit of a reward for nabbing our little thief.
Ah yes, excellent samples. Thank you. This coin should compensate you for all the bother.
Perfect. This is just what I needed. Here's some gold for your time.
Good, my experiments are at a critical stage and these are just what I need to finish. Here's some coin for all the trouble.
Riften is drowning in a sea of sin and wickedness and it's my personal mission to let everyone know that the warmth of Mara can see them through.
All I need is a messenger to bring Her words to these poor souls by distributing these missives.
Oh my, how wonderful! Lady Mara will be so pleased!
Here you are. Now make sure you give out every single one, we can't afford to let even one lost soul stray from Her warmth.
Don't stop. Keep cutting.
Wish I could say the same for us.
Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.
I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it.
Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?
I certainly hope so. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
At least tell me where you're going, so we can send someone after you if you don't come back.
I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus's remains to lay to rest.
I promise to join you there as soon as I can.
Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.
If you have further need of me, you can find me in the College.
Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.
Now, stand aside, there's work to be done.
Try not to disturb me in the future, I'm in the midst of groundbreaking research!
remembering a long lost friend
Well, for the thrill of course.
He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window rather than hunched over a dusty tome.
fond memory
Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language?
I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language.
Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details.
Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you. To Markarth and Calcelmo.
I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you.
What's this nonsense? Bah.
I'll read it. Thank you.
I don't have time for this nonsense.
Seems like a noble cause, I'll look it over.
If only more people would read this, things might be better in Riften.
I don't understand how paper will help the dregs of this city, but suit yourself.
Do you take me for a fool? Get this drivel away from me!
Thank you. Blessings of Mara upon you as well.
Interesting. I'll look it over. Thanks.
I hold my own beliefs, but thanks anyway.
Mara this and Mara that. Where is she when hundreds of Stormcloaks are dying for no good reason, eh?
Not really my usual read, but I'll give it a try.
Mara can't help me. No one can.
Oh, interesting. I'll read it this evening.
I have no desire to seek religion.
I visit the temple sometimes, but perhaps not often enough. Thanks for bringing this to me.
Thank you for the blessing, I'll put this to good use.
Oh, well thank you. I'll try and read this if I can.
Are you out of your mind?
I think I have some more of these padding my mattress.
I have no time for Marla or Mara or whatever her name is... there's work to be done!
Had only Mara saved that poor animal...
I'll give it a try, thanks very much.
Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.
Oh, how kind! Thank you.
Excellent, I needed some more kindling for my kitchen hearth.
Whatever you're peddling, I'm not buying.
Are you serious? You're as crazy as Maramal.
Look, the only religion I believe in is the good old septim. Everything else is just a waste.
Ugh. Get this awful paper away from me, by Talos!
Oh, a new pamphlet from Dinya? I'll be glad to read it. Thanks.
Huh? Oh. Sure, whatever. I prefer Dibella's teachings myself.
Thank you. Umm, blessings upon you too.
I wouldn't even clean my tail with this trash.
Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings.
Thank you. I'll share this with Aerin.
Hmmm. Never read anything from the temple before. I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in reading it.
Of course. Take what you need.
Of course. Here's a key to the house. Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
But what's this all about? What are you two doing here?
Like I said, I'm glad to help in any way I can. Help yourself to whatever you need, within reason.
You did? We heard that Ulfric was captured...
... no, sorry, but in times like these I can't just take the word of a stranger who wanders into town claiming to be my brother's friend.
Just head north - you can't miss it. It's the capital of Whiterun Hold.
Jarl Balgruuf still hasn't declared for one side or the other, so at least you won't run into any Imperials along the way.
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see Whiterun on its hill as you pass the falls.
Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day.
Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!
I met her when I wandered into Riften a few years ago. Been smitten with her ever since. In fact, I'm thinking of asking her to marry me.
In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond.
I already have the gold band, but all I need are three flawless amethysts to complete the setting.
The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.
Shocked
Smithing's been in my blood for generations. I owe my success to my forefathers and their recipe for flame.
The secret is my forge. It consumes fire salts, a strange mineral that burns as hot as Red Mountain lava.
Well, it was. Sadly, this forge is dying and I've used the last of my fire salts. If I can't feed it soon, it may grow cold.
godly appreciation
godly assessment, mildly annoyed
When you told me of your intent to join the Thieves Guild, I honestly didn't think we'd have much to speak about ever again.
Yet here you are with my weapon that you could have easily sold or kept for yourself.
Forgive me for my hasty opinion of you, I see that I was wrong and that there's much I can learn from you.
If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.
Astonishing. To think you actually were able to reach it and yet return to tell the tale.
Rarely in my travels have I encountered those who possess skills equal to your own.
I see I still have much to learn. If you'd permit me, I'd be honored to accompany you in your travels for a time.
See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here!
Hurry and get me out of this cage before they come for me!
They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments.
This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!
No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!
Almost ever since he became leader of the tribe.
He killed Shagrol in combat, which none of us thought possible. But the winner is made Chief. That is how it is done.
The anticipation is killing me. Can you figure out who has the contract? Which one will you choose?
I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like.
Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech.
Are you joking?
Even if we had a prisoner by that name, the only way he'd be released is by order of the Imperial Legion.
Now I suggest you turn around and go back the way you came.
The Thalmor? Do you have any idea what you're asking?
I'm sorry, that's just not possible. It would cause far too many problems.
I can only imagine the headaches this is going to cause...
Here, take this. Assuming they even honor it, you should be able to get your prisoner out.
Well... This seems to be in order. Very well, follow me.
We're right behind you.
Lead on, we're ready.
We're with you.
Will do. Don't stray too far away or else we'll come after you.
No problem, but if you get too far away, we're going to catch up.
All right, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you.
You beasts are the worst.
Come now, dearie, surely we aren't all that bad.
Just... leave me alone! I've brought your mead, now drink it and shut your filthy mouths.
Oh, we've got other things in mind for our mouths, sweetie.
Aye, the war keeps the Empire and the locals too busy to worry about us. Haldyn calls it [QUOTE]our golden age.[QUOTE]
Our secret ingredient, if you will.
A battle-mage of fearsome cunning.
Runs the Blood Horkers, and makes sure the battles end right-side up.
Adelaisa, I'm sorry.
Sorry isn't good enough, Orthus. There's a lot of gold at stake here, and sniveling isn't going to get it back.
Finally, someone around here that can get things done.
Since we're short on soldiers you'll be coming with us, too. No arguments.
Anything else you want to say?
Haldyn? I've heard of the man, but never guess he'd join up with some pirates.
This could be even more dangerous than I thought. Head to the ships. We'll plan the assault on the way.
Well, here we are. We think.
Don't know. Creepy fella, black robe. Couldn't see his face. Paid me a pretty sum to get that into your hands, though.
Do I make myself clear?
You've decided to help?
Mourning the loss of her mother. Should be holding back tears.
Deep breath after [QUOTE]all right[QUOTE] you are steeling yourself.

You found what?
Hmm. Well now. Yes, this might actually be something interesting. You'd better show that to Tolfdir right away.
I suppose you'd better show that to Tolfdir nonetheless. And please, ask before tampering with anything else.
As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest.
Sacked by the elves in the infamous [QUOTE]Night of Tears,[QUOTE] not much is known about what happened to Saarthal.
This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used...
Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting.
Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place?
What do you think we'll find in there?
It's thousands of years old. Who knows what we might find?
I'm betting bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. And maybe some valuables...
Don't get any ideas. We're here on official business, remember?
Are you excited to see what's in there? This is important to you Nords, isn't it?
Not excited, no. Some very bad things happened here.
Oh, right. That whole thing with the elves. Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?
I think, given the state of Skyrim, some might disagree.
This is a little creepy.
That doesn't begin to describe it.
You seem uncomfortable being here.
I just don't know that it's right for us to be in here like this, picking through the ruins .
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this isn't it.
There's no gold, nothing shiny at all.
Don't sound so disappointed. You wouldn't be allowed to take it even if there was.
Like anyone would even notice, in all this mess.
All right, calm down, no need to for that. I'll let you in right away, just need to get the gate unlocked.
Ooooh...yes...yes. You've fallen for my trap! Greed makes a great lure. Odd you didn't die from the fall though. Most do.
Alright, let's see if we have something here to end this as quickly as possible.
Don't worry though. It'll be relatively painless...relatively.
Oh, and don't mind my assistant here. He may have seen better days, but he's still more help to me dead than he was alive.
It's got to be somewhere around here! Now where did I put it?
Hhhmmm...maybe I put it over here.
Ah...Here it is. Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand still this will be much easier for me to do.
Oh, and I wasn't entirely truthful before. This is actually going to hurt a lot. You see, you have to be dead in order for the spell to take hold.
Come on! You know you want what's in that chest. Just walk toward it!
Just walk toward the chest! Gravity will do the rest.
I know you're up there. Go get the treasure. Doesn't it look pretty?

Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!
Thank you again for resolving my... problem.
Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?
Need a room? Or maybe just some mead?

I can't help you, friend. Talk to Hadring, the Innkeeper.
I value my privacy. So if you don't mind?
I really don't mean to be rude, friend, but I'm not feeling particularly sociable...
Hadring got himself another customer, eh?
The beds and beer are both lousy, you ask me.
What do you want?
Which one was the rat?
Dunno. One of these corpses. Does it matter?
coughs at the end and throughout - there's a lot of smoke from fire
Arcturus took some men deeper in, wanted to be sure. We should maybe... assist them.
Please hurry. To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there...
You've taken up enough of my time. Now leave.
Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.
What? Who are you? How did you get this far?
Your corpse will feed my spiders for weeks. Now die, you fool!
choking with sadness and emotion. Staggering the words.
So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!
I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.
Is someone following me?
You're trailing me? I knew I heard something.
Ha! I knew it was you all along.
Following me, huh? You're not very good at this are you?
You may as well give up, I see you there.
Must be my imagination.
Damn ears... playing tricks on me again. Can't stand this sea air!
Hey... is someone watching me?
I swear, if I'm being followed...
I swear I feel like I'm being watched.
If this keeps up, I'm headed back to the Winking Skeever.
I don't have time to chase shadows, I've got better things to do.

Goldenglow Estate provided a huge payout for us before Aringoth locked us out.
Maven looked the other way as long as the honey kept flowing and we kept him in line.
Let's not kid ourselves. Black-Briar Mead is swill. The only thing keeping it successful is Maven.
Word on the street was that Honningbrew tasted better, cost less and Sabjorn didn't shove it down everyone's throat.
If Sabjorn ever managed to push Maven off her pedestal, we'd all be in trouble.
We've lost more clients in the last decade than I'd care to count, but Maven's stuck with us through throughout the entire ordeal.
I'll be damned if I'm going to lose her to... well, to whatever they are.
You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention.
If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use it as leverage.
Yes, we spoke at length while you were in Whiterun dealing with our meadery situation.
I hope for all your sakes you find out who's behind this supposed [QUOTE]plot.[QUOTE]
Having Goldenglow kept in line by the Thieves Guild has kept the honey flowing with minimal cost.
Now, mysteriously, some sort of anonymous adversary shows up and takes the Estate out of my hands.
When you've been doing business like I have for decades, you quickly discover that the only person you can trust is yourself.
If you were to bring me the deed to Goldenglow Estate, so I was the full owner, that would be a step in the right direction.
Since I know losing the farm's payments will harm the Guild, I intend to make a substantial contribution for compensation.
I take care of my friends.
What's going on? What happened in there?
It 'may be' in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question.
That's certainly an understatement. I've never seen anything like this!
Well, I suppose we can't just stand here. We'd better do something.
We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.

Well? What word of the Emperor?
laughs uproariously. Couldn't be happier.
Despite your misfortunes, you stayed true to the Dark Brotherhood. You've saved us all, and for this you have my eternal thanks.
Now, of course I must ask... Killing the Emperor... How much did Motierre pay for such a thing?
laughs uproariously - couldn't be happier
Laughing  - very happy
Oh. Is that all? Really?
Come now! You're joking with old Nazir! Surely the Emperor's life was worth more than that.
Pfft. You'd think an emperor would fetch at least twice that. Damn that motherless cheapskate, Motierre.
In any event, here's my advice. Go to Riften's Ratway, find Delvin Mallory. I believe Astrid had you visit him once before, no?
Mallory is an expert [QUOTE]obtainer of goods.[QUOTE] We can use the money to repair and refit this Sanctuary. Make a true home for us, eh?
Laughing uproariously
This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.
You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.

You fought well. I find you worthy.
It is long since one of the living has entered here. May Shor's favor follow you and your errand.
Alduin escaped us long ago. Today we take our well-tempered revenge.
For a hundred lifetimes my heart has burned for revenge on Alduin too long delayed.

Your time runs short.
Please, we do not have much time.
It is done. Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, and the Dark Brotherhood yet lives.
Say a bit quieter as if walls have ears
In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.
Aha! You're back!
I know! I know! I received the news not moments ago! Ha ha! This is glorious!
My friend, you may not realize it, but you have served the Empire, indeed all of Tamriel, in ways you cannot possibly imagine.
Ah, but you care little for politics, am I right? You want money! And money you shall have!
Your payment waits for you at a dead drop. It is inside an urn, in the very chamber where we first met, in Volunruud.
Now please, go. Collect your money, and let us never look upon one another again. Our business, thank the gods, is concluded.
Your payment awaits. And don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to betray you.
Oh, for the love of Mara, would you please just go?
And what might that be?
You assassins and your riddles. It really does get very annoying, you know. Now if you'll excuse me...
Ha! Well, I certainly do feel that way.
Now, if, um... you'll get going?
Yes? No? Nothing?
Very well, then. If you'll just... get going now...
All right. Had I known the deal would bring me this much trouble, I never would have accepted the gold.
I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!
But of course. You and I have a date with destiny. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?
Yes, I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
But I wonder... would you suffer an old man a few more words before the deed is done?
I thank you for your courtesy.
You will kill me, and I have accepted that fate. But regardless of your path through life, I sense in you a certain... ambition.
So I ask of you a favor. An old man's dying wish. While there are many who would see me dead, there is one who set the machine in motion.
This person, whomever he or she may be, must be punished for their treachery.
Once you have been rewarded for my assassination, I want you to kill the very person who ordered it. Would you do me this kindness?
Oh, you can save your sinister bravado. I'll not go to my grave whimpering like an infant.
I know why you're here. I must die. And you must deliver the blow. It is simply the way it is.
You and I have a date with destiny, it would seem. But so it is with assassins and emperors, hmm?
Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking.
Tsk. How unfortunate. I had hoped you would honor an old man's dying wish. Well, let's be done with it then.
You will hear me out, then? Good.
Well? I won't fight you, so we may as well get this over with.
Don't you have all the information you need? Please, the Emperor isn't going to kill himself. Hmph. Now wouldn't that be a blessing...
Now, on to the business at hand I suppose, hmm?
Hmph. Pity. I had hoped to obtain even a modicum of justice.
Well, on to the business at hand then, hmm?
Well. Perhaps you'll at least consider it, hmm?
Now, on to the business at hand...
By the gods. You... you're alive! But I had heard... your Sanctuary...
Please! You mustn't think I had anything to do with that! I wanted the Emperor dead! The true Emperor! I still do! It was Maro! He...
You mean, after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still... honor the contract?
Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news!
emphatic.
If you can get onboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted... I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment.
Well, I don't know.
It's in the Solitude Inlet - that's the channel just north of the docks.
I suppose you should go to the docks and... swim?
Surely you're joking?
This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you.
Still... everyone assumes the Dark Brotherhood has been completely destroyed. They may be a bit more lax than usual.
Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why.
Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction.
The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing.
Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late.
You seek that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge.
You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume.
You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it.
The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others.
There is no help for you here.
There is no solace in knowing what is to come.
Your perseverance will only lead you to disappointment.
Still you persist? Very well, you may enter.
Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood.
I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-brother to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.
I welcome the chance to challenge the blade of Ysgramor's heir, honored shield-sister to Kodlak Whitemane, whom I've watched for in vain.
Well met, mage of Skyrim.
The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall.
Here in Shor's house we honor it still.
You trespass here, shadow-walker. Shor does not know you.
Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way.
Welcome I do not offer, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.
Do not mistake the night-shrouded thief's stealthily-taken spoils, stolen and unearned, for a warrior's plunder, won in honorable battle.
Your doom already binds you to your dark mistress, but your errand I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.
Shor's favor has found you, Dragonborn. The Hall of Valor, heart's-ease, awaits.
Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please do be careful.
Very well. It's not something often discussed, as it might be... misunderstood by the locals.
The Augur is down in the Midden, below the College. I don't recommend going down there unless it's absolutely necessary.
Astrid is dead. It is as it should be. May she find redemption in the Void.
But while you live, the Dark Brotherhood lives. We must fulfill our contract. Emperor Titus Mede II must be eliminated.
Speak with Amaund Motierre at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will know the true Emperor's location.
But first, inform Nazir of your plans. For you are the Listener, and must bind this Family together.
Don't you know? What drew you here? Surely your dreams showed you the way?

Was Jarl Ulfric with you?
Shor's bones. We were too late. Damn the Empire.
No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.
All right, Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it.
Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?
Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!
I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!
That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei.
This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!
We can do this one of two ways. You can walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice.
But... I... very well.
I'll make the preparations immediately!
A bit amused, but also a bit condescending, like a parent challenging his child.
Confident
I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't.
He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor.
His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind.
You look like you've seen your share of adventure. I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something. Will you hear me out?
Thank you. I can't stand the thought of being trapped in this village for the rest of my days.
In life I felled / foes unnumbered,   fearless in battle; / but no blade can defend     against the terror / of this gloom-stricken valley.
When Ulfric Stormcloak, / with savage Shout,    sent me here, / my sole regret    was fair Elisif, / left forlorn and weeping.
I faced him fearlessly / - my fate inescapable,    yet my honor is unstained / - can Ulfric say the same?
When I woke from cold death,/ my doom was lifted - there was Shor's Hall,/ my heart's desire.
But now I wander,/ weary and lost.   Alduin hunts me / as we once hunted our prey -    a bitter payment / for many bloody deeds.
The bitter war / of the world beyond was all for naught. / We are all trapped
was all for naught/ We are all trapped    in Alduin's web / - for our allegiance he cares not,    but devours us equally / - doom unescapable.
Shor as well /- he welcomes all heroes    to his kingly hall, / if we could but reach it.
Skyrim was betrayed, / the blood of her sons     spilled in doomed / struggle against fate.
And so in death, too late, / I learn the truth    - fed by war, / so waxed the power     of Alduin, World-Eater / - wisdom now useless.
By gods' jest / in this grim mist    together snared, / Stormcloak and Imperial,     we wander hopeless, / waiting for succor.
Dragonborn, even in death / you dog my steps?
How come you here? / The keeper of this realm     will cast you out / - cursed be your name     by all sons of Skyrim, / with scorn unceasing.
Do you know the way? I'm weary and lost.
Turn back! Before he finds you!
I'll try to hold to your hopeful purpose. Quickly, before this encompassing fog once more snares me in the World-Eater's net.
The World-Eater waits   within the mist!Bring word to Shor's hall   of our hard fate!
This is all very strange. I've never seen anything like this.
I think perhaps it might be best if you lead the way. My eyes aren't what they used to be.
Don't worry, I'll stay right with you.

Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts.
For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks.
Mercer doesn't need to die... he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.
I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate.

Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.
Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what's known as the Nightingale Trinity.
The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.
She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.
Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms.
She influences our luck and in return demands payment.
You're closer to understanding than you realize.
The only difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense and sometimes the cost can be quite high.
Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.
Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves?
Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket?
It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.
Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject.
Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows.
The return certainly seems worth the risk though.
Don't leave me here!
I, uhh... wait, what?

I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!
Ancano. He's in there, doing... something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now.
I will have his head for this, I assure you.
Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it.
Excellent. I'd suggest that we go retrieve it immediately, but right now we have more pressing matters.
Ancano has somehow locked himself in the hall. He's up to something, and I intend to put a stop to it.
Help us get through this, will you? We're throwing everything we have at it.
Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.

Don't go near him!
Kust is responsible for the cemetery here in Falkreath, I take care of the Shrine.
The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases.
War is not new to Falkreath. You have only to stand in our cemetery to see that.
Dengeir deserves more respect than his nephew, Jarl Siddgeir, affords him.
Without birth there is no life, without death there is only stasis. Such is the truth of Arkay.
Strangers like you bring war. I've seen enough war.
These graves hold the sons and daughters of Falkreath.
Show respect while you're here and you and I will be fine.
You have the look of a killer.
Arkay helps us find peace with death.
Indara and I like to keep to ourselves and run our farm.
Runil has been a true friend to my wife and I in our time of need.
My wife, Indara, has a gift with animals.  It makes her a better farmer than anyone I've ever seen.
This war isn't needed. Imperials like my wife can be hard to handle but we Nords could work with them. I should know.
I don't know if the war is Arkay's will or man's, but it's none of my doings.
My husband Mathias and I tend Corpselight Farm.
Falkreath is a hard place and tending a farm here is thankless work.
Mathies is a kind and wise man. The Nords could use more like him. So could the Imperials.
How could people see all the graves in Falkreath and still want to make war?
Steel's good, but loyalty's better. I'm loyal to Dengeir first and the Empire second.
Only a hearty soul travels the road these days.
The war bleeds Skyrim. It bleeds her dry and I think none of us are the better for it.
Men and women join the war, they travel far on these roads to spill each other's blood.
Falkreath's warriors always return, one way or another.
Someone new, perhaps someone looking for me to mix something up for them?
Don't let the shop's name frighten you away. I have plenty of reliable tonics and healing potions to sell.
If either these Nords or Imperials had some red in their blood this war would be over.
A hearty welcome to Falkreath!  All of Skyrim's true sons are welcome here!
Stay out of my way, boot.
I can't believe we let provincials like you wander Skyrim.
You'll find my brother Solaf and I are the only true Nords in Falkreath.
Well met. Unlike my brother, I've no dislike of strangers. Met lots of 'em while I was a Stormcloak.
Can I get you something?
Don't mind Bolund. He's young and gets riled easily.
Looking for something?
What do you need, stranger?
Shor's bones! A handsome man in Falkreath.
You're going to have the men around here wrapped around your finger in no time.
A strong drink will chase off that chill in the air.
I've half a mind to ask if you'll take me on one of your adventures, but I can't just leave Valga on her own.
Not much exciting happens around here. You're as like as not to be bored to death if you stay too long.
Anything I can get you?
Can I get you a drink?
Welcome to Dead Man's Drink.
I escaped fighting in Cyrodiil only to have it track me down again in Skyrim.
I wouldn't complain if we could string together a few sunny days now and then.
Try not to judge Falkreath too harshly, visitor - the war has been hard on us.
I'm sorry, I should really go now.
I can't really help you, I'm just Dengeir's maid.
Emphasis on the word [QUOTE]encouraged[QUOTE], intended to convey that you believe you were forced out of office by your peers.
Be mindful. My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to that pompous nephew of mine, Siddgeir.
Enemies and ears. Both are everywhere.
If you're sympathetic to the Empire, you'll be wise to put Falkreath far behind you.
My nephew has always been handed things, even the title of Jarl.
Stendarr protect Falkreath until Skyrim's Sons rise.
The war has changed Falkreath, even our neighbors can be our enemies.
I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be.
Falkreath's cemetery reminds of us that war is not new here.
Being Housecarl of Falkreath is an honor.
Treat the Jarl with respect, and you'll be welcome here.
I'm the Steward here.  I serve under Jarl Siddgeir and Jarl Dengeir before him.
Siddgeir can sometimes act too quickly but he does listen to Helvard and I.
For Falkreath and I this is just one more war in a long line.
Disinterested, arrogant
Boland speaks much about the war and the Stormcloaks but he knows who provides.
The Stormcloaks want freedom but don't understand its price.
There are opportunities everywhere.  Why don't you go find them.
No time, I have business to conduct.
Unless you intend to bury someone, this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.
Falkreath was once full of wanderers and warriors like yourself. Those were better days.
Skyrim's history of war is well documented here in Falkreath's graveyard.
My brother Dengeir can be... difficult. Take his words with a grain of salt.
Can't believe we let provincials like you wander around Skyrim.
That Valga Vinicia is a gossip and a troublemaker.
In Falkreath if I don't know it, it's not worth knowing.
From maid to Steward, I can hardly believe it. I hope I'm up to the task.
Be mindful.  My maid Tekla has been known to pass information to Siddgeir.
Nenya's history of service is impeccable.  She truly is the Steward of Falkreath.
Dengeir was a good Jarl in his day.  Even if his day has passed.
Stand aside.  I don't need to speak to you.
Unless you intend to bury someone this isn't the place you're looking for, traveler.
In pain, coughing, near death. Burned badly, and doesn't have a lot of time left.
No! Don't pity me. I deserve whatever fate the Dread Lord has in store. I betrayed you... and now Maro has betrayed me. Fitting...
I just wanted things... to stay the way they were. Before Cicero, before the Night Mother. Before... you. I thought I could save us. I was wrong.
But you're alive! So there's still a chance. A chance to start over, rebuild. That's why I did... this.
Don't you see? I prayed to the Night Mother! I am the Black Sacrament.
Don't you see? It was me. I set you up, wanted you dead. I betrayed you, the Night Mother... everything I hold dear. And now Maro has betrayed me.
I'm saying you were right. The Night Mother was right. The old ways... they guided the Dark Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them.
And to prove my... sincerity, I have prayed for a contract. You lead this Family now. I give you the Blade of Woe, so that you can see it through.
You must kill...
Windhelm has been hard on my people. But our fortunes will turn, and we have shelter and food.
Ah. I see.
Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly.
Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I?
The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.
The... the books? Oh, I see. I thought perhaps... Well, I thought you'd come for me.
But yes, the books. The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes.
Looks like nobody here knows what's happened yet. Come on. Gerdur's probably working in her lumber mill.
Gerdur!

I can't believe you're doing this! Stop!
disgusted
Thank you for your help.  Did you see my family inside?
Watch yourself out there. The mercenaries Aringoth hired are trained killers. Just ask our poor little Vex.
The honey they collect on that hunk of rock goes into making Black-Briar Mead; just about the best tasting mead in all of Skyrim.
I wouldn't bother smacking at those hives with a weapon. Set 'em on fire and they'll go up like kindling.
I'd like to know why you're wasting time asking about it when you should already be on your way.
Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island.
That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.

It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine.
Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...
Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.
My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself.

Well, we'd better get back to our rounds.
Oh, it's you. I didn't expect to see you again.
Trying to stay ahead of the Thalmor assassins. I'm not a hero like you. I don't stand a chance.
I count my blessings every day.
Don't worry, I'm mad at her, too. And at myself for ever agreeing to get involved in her insane scheme.
Trying to stay alive. I think time's running out though. I'm pretty sure the Thalmor know where I am.
Maybe you can help me. You know, by way of making amends for getting me into this mess.
shocked that someone's willing to help
That's... great news. I'd... I'd better go. Right now. Before they find me again. This is my chance.
Thank you! Here... I stole a lot from the Thalmor over the years. You may as well have some of it.
I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere, that is.
But there's a Khajiit hanging around the main gate. I didn't like the way he was looking at me.
I'm sure he's Thalmor. Just waiting for me to leave so he can follow me and kill me in a lonely place.
I was trying to get to Morrowind. The Dunmer don't care much for the Thalmor and I figured I'd be safe there. As safe as anywhere,that is.
You'd be saving my life. Again. I know I probably seemed ungrateful... I've just been so scared. Expecting a knife at my throat any minute.
No, you can't ever be too paranoid where the Thalmor is concerned. Look what happened to the Blades. The Blades!
If the damn Blades are no match for the Thalmor, what chance do I have?
Please, just go check it out. You'll be saving my life.
Move on, friend. I have nothing to sell today.
Malborn? Ah... very good. I think we understand each other.
Indeed. That would be best.
The Thalmor never forget.
You'll have a traitor's death.
Why struggle? The Thalmor will only send more like me.
A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training.
It usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father.
The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... I some ways I still don't.
I had to for honor's sake, but I had waited too long. My father died before he could see my training to completion.
When I finally became a priest, they gave me the new high priest's dagger, but I already owned my father's.
So you see, I have to return it. It breaks tradition, and I need to tell him that I finally did what he wanted.
She finally decided to return it to her father. Bless her heart.
I will make sure this finds its way to his tomb as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing it, my child.

If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose.

Oh, the Listener, well... listens! The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path.
But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate.
Oh... Well... yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero.
says it in a shocked whisper
Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper.
Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg!
Wait... the Listener is serious? Oh.
Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or... I don't know! But speak she will!
The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.

The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage.
On moonlit nights or in darkened rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible.
The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgement of those around him.
By weaving the darkness to their will, this agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time.
This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them.
At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger.
Good luck, Nightingale.
Choose your path and your journey will be complete.
We're not done talking. You fell for that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers - didn't you? I won't let her have you!
Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke.
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother... but she spoke to you?
conspiring, vile
There's a cave here. Perfect hideout for bandits or worse.
Another filthy cave. Always so dark.
Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.
Hey look, a cave. Wonder what's inside?
Look, a cave. An exciting place to venture, if you know what you're doing.
There's a cave here. Bears if we're lucky. Trolls if we're not.
Look at that, a cave. Who knows what could be down there?
Look, a cave. A fine place to find trouble.
A cave. Dark. Dangerous.
There's a cave. Tread carefully.
Hey, there's a cave. Bad place to stumble drunk.
There's a cave here. Think we should check it out?
We've found a cave. I don't think there are warm fires and friendly faces inside.
There's a cave. Animals or bandits inside, no doubt.
A cave. Up for some hunting?
Cave up ahead. Trouble or maybe treasure?
It's a Nordic ruin. Thousands of years old.
Look. Nordic ruins. I hope there's gold inside.
Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.
Is that one of the old ruins?
Oh, look. A Nordic ruin.
Old ruins. Nordic, I think.
My word, look at those ruins. Remarkable.
Look at those ruins. How long have they stood here, I wonder?
Old stonework. Gold, traps, and bones.
Nord stonework. Thousands of years old.
Look at those old stones. Ancient Nords sure could build.
Look at those ruins. Think there's gold inside?
The old Nords sure did love their stonework.
Look at these stones. The ancestors knew how to build, no doubt.
Ruins ahead. Means old traps and bonewalkers.
Look. One of the ancient Nord ruins. Who knows what's down there?
The entrance to a dwarven city. All manner of strange traps and machines will be inside.
Is this that dwarven city? I hear the treasure from their ruins is worth a fortune.
Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.
Look over there. That's a dwarven ruin.
A dwarven city. A place of mystery and death.
Dwarven metalwork. So much wasted effort.
Oh, look. It's the entrance to a dwarven city. I've heard stories....
I dislike lurking near dwarven cities. It's like their ghosts are watching us.
Huh. Dwarven ruins. Strange places.
A Dwemer city. The lost people. The heretics.
Is that a dwarven city? I've never seen a dwarf, ever. Don't think anyone has.
Seems like a ruin. Dwarven, I think?
By the Mane, look. A dwarven city. Still sitting here after thousands of years.
Get nervous around dwarven stonework. Legends say these cities are haunted.
Old dwarven ruin. Look at that metalwork. Such a waste.
That's a dwarven city. I hear they built armor that walks like people.
Don't see that every day.
I've seen better. Well, maybe not.
Damn. That's quite a sight.
I've never seen anything quite like that.
What a sight....
Mighty impressive.
Wow! That's impressive.
By the Hist, what a sight....
That's...that's...wow.
Impressive. Damn impressive.
Look at that. Am I drunk? I must be drunk.
Wow. Would you look at that.
By the Twin Moons...
By Ysmir! That's impressive.
Gotta admit, that's impressive.
By the Nine!
Get ready. Trouble ahead.
Yuck. Something smells.
Trouble is in the air here.
I smell blood.
Keep your blade ready.
I don't like where this is going.
I have a feeling there's going to be trouble.
Get ready for a fight.
Keep your eyes open.
Get a bad feeling.
Don't like the looks of this.
Something smells foul.
Got a feeling there's trouble ahead.
Smell that? Blood.
I don't think I like where this is going.
Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island.
In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should talk to her about it before you go.
We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing.
If the workers had a dispute, we'd rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments.
In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.
slightly scolding
Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business.
laugh at beginning, jovial
It's just business.
The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours.
Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.
I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand.
You're losing this war, and you know it.
You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition.
I'm sure that will be comforting to your comrades that gave their lives for the territory you just handed to Ulfric.
You should think harder on your oath to the Emperor next time you're deciding what's right.
You are hereby dishonorably dismissed and removed from the rolls of the Imperial Legion.
I'm sorry. Good luck.
Legate, with me. We have a lot of work to do.
This is quite an achievement, Dragonborn. And Jarl Ulfric. Markarth is ours!
Giving up Riften is a heavy price to pay for this truce, Dragonborn. I hope it was worth it.
I admit, I really didn't expect these talks to succeed. Getting the Empire to agree to anything at all is quite an achievement.
Jarl Vignar, I assume you are familiar with the Dragonborn's plan?
By Talos, that's an excellent question. I hope you haven't forgotten that little detail?
Shout for Odahviing from the Dragonsreach courtyard. After that, it's up to you.
Interesting problem. Hmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple.
Fair? This is war, soldier. War's about winning, not being fair to the enemy.
The Empire showed its true colors today, eh? Don't worry. I was once loyal to the Empire, too, before my eyes were opened.
Come see me in Windhelm when all this is over, and I'll find a place for you.
I'm sorry to hear that. I thought your eyes had finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Welcome, brother! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Welcome, sister! I'm glad that your eyes have finally been opened to the Empire's true nature.
Pay no attention to him. A ponderous windbag, like most Imperial generals.
dismissive anger
I wish we could offer more help, but our last attack went sour and we're all that is left.
more encouraging than happy
Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor.
Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin.
Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.
You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily.
Yes. For Sithis... and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time.
Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin.
Here, take this - it's called Jarrin Root.
All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead.
Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've [QUOTE]arranged[QUOTE] for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded.
Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener.
It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable - cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew.
One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it.
Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.
Gianna will be overjoyed to meet you. She's in the kitchens.
What's this now?
...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers... the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]...
By Azura. The Gourmet!
I... I'm sorry! Your clothes... of course... I should have realized!
Please, excuse my ignorance.  Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You should proceed to the kitchens straight away.
I... I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We... we had no idea who to expect, you understand. You're not dressed as I would have suspected...
But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival.
The Gourmet. This is such an honor.
The misses and I love your strawberry tarts.
Hmmm, the Potage le Magnifique. Smells delicious.
happy, friendly
Move along, citizen.
Just go right into the tower, then straight ahead to the kitchen. Gianna's expecting you.
Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!
We'll begin as soon as you're wearing the hat. Check the shelf over there. Wouldn't want the Emperor mistaking you for someone else, now would we.
Oh, just look at you. Absolutely brilliant. Now... now you're just as I imagined.
The Emperor is going to love it. How can he not?
Nervous - talking to herself
Maybe when this is all over, you could sign one of your cookbooks for me?
I'm so nervous.
The... Gourmet?
Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it.
It's just...
Well, I don't mean to seem disappointed, but... I just never figured the Gourmet was an Imperial. I had dreamed of something more exotic, maybe...
Well, I'm just surprised the Gourmet is a Redguard. I had you pegged for a Wood Elf, honestly. You know, because of your use of...
You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less...
Well, I just never expected the Gourmet to be a Breton. It almost seems too obvious. Some of the greatest cooks have been Bretons, and...
It's just... Well... you're an Orc! Ha ha ha! If the people of the Empire only knew! I mean, now I understand your need for secrecy. Most would...
You're a High Elf! I... I never would have guessed it. So many of your recipes are clearly aimed at the commonfolk. It just seems...
I guessed right! I... I always imagined the great Gourmet was a Wood Elf. You see, only someone with a knowledge of woodland herbs could combine...
I... Well, I just can't believe the Gourmet is a Dark Elf. How difficult it must have been for you in Morrowind. The food there is...
You... you're an Argonian! Where did you learn to cook like that? Surely not in Black Marsh. Why even the...
Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem.
The Emperor has requested your signature dish - the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started.
But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it... the Gourmet's special way.
The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... which ingredient should I add next?
Oh. Well, um, actually... you're not. Wearing a chef's hat, I mean. There's one right over there on the shelf. You can't very well cook without it...
Carrots? Really? Okay...
Ooohh.... how decadent. I never would have guessed it.
Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique.
Well then, I think  a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right?
Now what?
Maybe we should start over, hmm? We want the Gourmet's famous Potage le Magnifique to be perfect, after all.
So, what is the first special ingredient?
Vampire dust? Seriously?
Hmm... yes. I guess I can see how that would add a more... earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand...
All right. What next, then?
Ah, of course. I suspected as much.
My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor.
A... giant's toe? You're... sure about that?
Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea.
Okay. Now what?
Ooookay.... Um.... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two...
A Septim? As in... a gold coin? Really?
Ah, I see now. That would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic - but delicious - aftertaste. Simply brilliant.
I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?
Hmmm... horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of...
Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat.
My choice, hmm? All right, then - tomatoes. Simple, yet infinitely flavorful. Don't you agree?
Well, I have to say, the stew seems done. Add anything else, and we may dilute the distinct flavors. So... is that it?
Of course! I.... I'm sorry. One giant's toe. There.
What, um... What next?
Oh? What is this, some kind of herb? Are you sure? The Potage tastes perfect as it is. Any other ingredient might...
Excellent. They should be ready for us now.
And if I may say so... it has been an honor, getting a chance to prepare a meal with, well... the best chef in the entire Empire.
I'll carry the stew pot, and lead the way up to the dining room. I'm sure the Emperor and his guests are dying to meet you.
Heh, I'm sorry. Of course. It's your most famous recipe, after all.
All right then, your secret ingredient's been added.
disappointed, but no surprise there
excited - gloating

You surrender Hjaalmarch to us, and take Idgrod Ravencrone with you. Sorli the Builder will take over as Jarl of Morthal.
You surrender Falkreath to us. Siddgeir steps down, and Dengeir of Stuhn resumes the Jarlship.
You withdraw from the Pale, and allow Jarl Skald the Elder to return to Dawnstar.
We want Imperial forces to withdraw from Winterhold, and allow Jarl Kraldar to return from exile.
emphasizing that he (unlike the Imperials) is thinking of the greater good
If we're not going to get Markarth, we need you to give us something.
You know as well as I do that that we can't hand over Riften on these terms.
Don't hand me a mug of sheep's piss and call it mead. These terms are still not acceptable.
These terms are not acceptable. You know that.
Come on, Tullius. You have to give a little ground here. The dragons are a threat to us both.

What makes you think I'll give that to you, if I wouldn't give you Markarth?
Where do these demands stop, Ulfric? Do you expect me to surrender all of Skyrim?
You treat us fairly. Thank you.
Spoken like a true son of Skyrim!
Spoken like a true daughter of Skyrim!
What? And you call yourself a son of Skyrim?
What? And you call yourself a daughter of Skyrim?
I'm willing to let the Dragonborn be the judge of the fairness of my request.
It seems I have no choice but to let the Dragonborn decide. Although I'm starting to doubt your fairness.
Jarl Ulfric...
General Tullius...
You both agree to this?
clearing your throat a bit before beginning - you're summing up your position
But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with.
I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances.
But once Alduin is defeated - then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember - [QUOTE]Evgir Unslaad.[QUOTE]
The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs.
These are the terms currently on the table.

The Empire will withdraw its troops from Winterhold, allowing Jarl Korir to return from exile.
But I at least will negotiate in good faith.
Markarth is off the table. Your rabble is on the verge of defeat. We have no need of a truce at such a price.
skeptical that Ulfric is actually serious
You always were a fool, Ulfric. You'll never get a better chance to salvage something from the ruins of your ambition.
Stop! Are you so blind to our danger that you can't see past your petty disagreements?
Here you sit arguing about... nothing! While the fate of the land hangs in the balance!

And I advise you both to listen to what he has to say, before you do anything rash.
starting to lose it
Alduin has returned! The World-Eater! Even now, he devours the souls of your fallen comrades!
He grows more powerful with every soldier slain in your pointless war!
Can you not put aside your hatred for even one moment in the face of this mortal danger?
A very pretty speech, but what does it have to do with...
thinking over what Esbern just said as he speaks
very controlled, very angry
slowly, mulling over what Esbern just said
If this truce will help the Dragonborn here put an end to that menace, we both gain. Remember that, Ulfric.
I think you're on the wrong side in this war, my friend.
You slaughtered them - the women, the children! You butchers!
That's a lie! My legionnaires are disciplined, unlike your...
Think carefully where your loyalties lie... brother.

I don't know why I expected even-handed treatment from you.
I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, despite your known Imperial sympathies.
You're different from what I expected, Dragonborn. You treat us with respect, despite your known Imperial sympathies.
Think hard about your loyalties, brother. I expected better from you.
I expected better from you Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn.

Well done, brother. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.
Well done, sister. If you can hold these Imperials to their promises, we might be able to reach an agreement.
You've dealt with us fairly so far. You've heard our demand. What say you?
What say you, Dragonborn?
Now that that's settled, may we proceed?
Who would like to open the negotiations?
This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request.
I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim.
Jarl Ulfric.
General Tullius.
a bit wearily
But the difficulty remains - how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?
I expected better of you, Dragonborn. You swore an oath to serve the Emperor. Don't forget it.
I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation.
You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation to this council, despite your known association with the rebels.
But it seems you have no intention of dealing fairly with me.
You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric.
I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You treated us fairly despite your known rebel sympathies.
But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all.
You can trample us underfoot but we will rise again!
Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you.
As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!
You did the best you could, brother. But I've learned the hard way that these Imperials are best dealt with at sword point.

mockingly emphasizing [QUOTE]General[QUOTE]
Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire!
Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place.
You always were a fool, Ulfric. You're no better at diplomacy than you are on the battlefield.
You've been even-handed so far. What do you say to our demand?
So, Dragonborn. What do you say?
Ah. I believe I can be of help here.
That's what comes of trying to win a war with a bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!
Take your seat and we can begin.
We all wait upon you, Dragonborn.
Why delay? Please, take your seat so we can begin.
Fair enough. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still...
I did ask. Although I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're really on. Still...
Fair enough. I thought you might be able to see past your Imperial loyalties in the interests of peace, but I guess not. Still...
Fair enough. You claim to be neutral, but it seems that you actually favor the Empire. Still...
Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight.

You've proven reliable. There's a group of bandits in my Hold that I... may have had a few discreet dealings with.
The cut they were giving me was good at first, but now it's time to clean things up. Go and take care of it.
Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear.
I can fashion whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you.
A blade! It will be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!
Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up.
Just like Ysgramor himself.
Sure you can handle that? Ha! Of course you can.
Now that's a smart weapon. Light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me.
Speak with Miss Salma, if you wish to speak.
I grow tired of debating this. If Miss Salma insists on this folly, so be it.

I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing.
He what?
You must be one of the new apprentices, then? Fine, fine. Just... just don't make a mess of my work, all right?
Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work.
I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here.
Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything.
Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory.
Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor!
Unlike your Imperial friends here.

What would the Empire want in return?
mildly, sadly
forcefully -- he's a general, used to people snapping to when he speaks.
First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time.
You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death.
You're right. Ulfric isn't in any position to ask for Markarth.
with resolve
Then I must do this alone.
Exclamation is in surprise more at what she just did than noticing the player.
At last.
I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will.
The child is spirited, but lacks... agency.
I've seen enough to know their fabric. The warp of air, the weft of time.
But no, it is not in my possession.
The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him.
He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure.
In time, he brought me here. To the box.
But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.
The Greybeards? What do those old hermits want with me?
Why? There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.
Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched.
No, you're right. After all this time, Ulfric still holds almost half of Skyrim.
Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses.
From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes.
with a deep sigh of doubt and hesitation
We're ready when you are.
You do have a plan for luring a dragon here, yeah?
Go ahead and call this dragon of yours. We're ready.
What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with.

I anticipated the problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple.
By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be.
He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge.
Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin.
I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.
Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll.
Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice, but it is written here in this scroll.
So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet.
And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.
Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect me too.
As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away.
Even right this moment, I feel strange... when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all.
The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.
Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on... holiday.
Please, just let me be...
Gourmet? Why I... Um...
Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?
What? The Emperor? But I...
Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!
Yes, well. Perhaps the proprietor of this establishment can assist you. Please, you're starting to... frighten me.
Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you? Please, you're starting to... frighten me.
Come now, you've got your orders. What else could you possibly need?
[QUOTE]Uncommon Taste.[QUOTE] It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight.
The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent.
I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for.
But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.
Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef.
But the Emperor canceled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed.
And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim... on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that.
Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him.
I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane.
In any event, our anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing.

Hey! Those belong to my family!

Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up. Let's get in there and put and end to this.

I owe Thorald my life. Helping to save him is the least I can do.
No one should ever be left to the Thalmor.
The Thalmor need to be taught a lesson.
I pledged to aid Avulstein and Thorald a long time ago. There's nothing that could keep me from helping them now.
I must be on my way now.
I owe you my life, friend.
Keep going! We need to get farther away from here!
Let's get out of here, fast as we can!
You there! What are you doing?
We're getting Thorald back, no matter what.
Do you have news? Did you find something?
Please, let's speak privately.
Please, anything you can do to help find my Thorald...
If only you could help bring my son back to me.
Thorald's disappearance has left our family in shambles.
Please, stop! I'll pay! Take it!
Please, no more. I'll pay, I'll pay. Here!
Here... take your damn coin and get out of here!

Not at all. It's good to be put in your place once in a while.

You're no liar. Best fight I've had in years. There you are.
You ever need another blade at your side, just ask. Wouldn't mind seeing how you handle a few trolls.
You're a real fighter. I like that.
You ever need my steel by your side, you just ask.
My axe is yours, outlander. Just say the word.
That you have. Here.
Fair fight. Here you are.
Fine. The hilt is in a chest inside my house.  Here are the keys. Take that damn thing and go.
Yeah. Here.
Yeah, yeah. Go on in.
Here. I hope you choke on it.
You win. On my honor, Carlotta won't have to worry about me ever again.
I get your point. Tell Iddra I'm sorry for being so stubborn about the coin.
You got me, fair and square. Tell Haran I'll pay.
I yield. By the honor of Clan Shatter-Shield, the Argonians will be paid as much as any other worker.
All right. Tell the old man his debts are settled.
All right. I'll lay off him. Just leave.
Fine! I'll take care of it, just please leave me alone!

I inherited the store from my husband. His father was Arnleif.
My husband, Gunnar, died about five years ago. Forsworn attack. I miss that stubborn oaf.
Thank you. I'll have a sum of gold waiting for you when you return.
No. As if trade wasn't poor enough. Now there's violence in the streets.
It was the Forsworn, wasn't it? I lose dozens of shipments every season to those barbarians. Now they're in the city? Gods help us.

Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?
No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it.
I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.
I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away.
Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath.
I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?
I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times.
No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way.
For now, give this [QUOTE]Ratway[QUOTE] a wide berth.
Dirge! Did you take out the trash like I asked?

Job's done, boss. Gave the package to her just you said.
Good. Did she say anything we need to know?
Yep. She said that the Jarl was planning a surprise raid on us, but she talked her out of it. Said she saved us a lot of trouble.
That she did. Very good. I'll tell Brynjolf.

It means I have a business to run, I need to have the books straight and you're barely ever here!
For goodness sake, Bolli! You barely lift a finger yourself when you're here except to point at things for your workers to do.
Let them do the work, that's what you pay them for!
Bolli, I was looking at the finances and I noticed you've been donating gold to the Temple of Mara. Are you out of your mind?
Maramal's been helping me through a rough patch. I just wanted to pay him back. It's not like he's keeping it!
Uh huh. I'm sure he runs outside with the coin and throws it up in the air so Mara herself can catch it. Come off of it, Bolli.
You may be my wife, but this is my business, so just do your job. Don't worry, you'll still have plenty of gold left over to waste on trinkets.
Wujeeta, we need to talk.
I know, I was late. I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you. I can't just let this go unpunished.
Please, don't get rid of me! I need the coin. I... I'll work for free for the rest of this week. Please!
Sigh. Very well. You're lucky Maramal has placed me in a very forgiving mood.
Wujeeta, you can't keep showing up here late. Bolli's just going to get someone to replace you.
No, no, no. I need this job! This is the last place in town to have work.
mutter this as if to self
Nothing, nothing. Just straighten yourself out before you find yourself headed back to Black Marsh.
Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?
Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments.
I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.
Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?
Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment.
Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.
Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it.
I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead.
We... don't have enough to...
Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere.
No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss.
Thank you, Laila.
Hafjorg! Where did you put it woman?!
Sigh. What is it now, dear?
Don't you [QUOTE]dear[QUOTE] me! I had a bowl of Vampire Dust on my worktable not an hour ago and after you swept in there it's gone!
Oh my. Elgrim, it's on the shelf to the right of the table, as always.
Ah, I see. Well, just be careful around my things!
Elgrim, honey. I'm concerned about your new pupil. She seems very... odd.
Ingun? She's brilliant; a natural!
Oh dear, I didn't mean to say she isn't bright.
It's the things she makes here, the things she says and all those poor little animals she tests them on. It's just not right.
Damn it, woman! Ingun is the most promising alchemist I've ever seen and I won't have you scaring her off!
So, Talen. Have you reconsidered my offer?
Sorry Hemming, I've no interest in becoming your valet.

I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home.
You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!
Have I told you about Valen, my dear?
I love when you spin that yarn. Gets better every time you add something new.
He killed six Imperial Guards before they dragged him into the prisons.
Was this before or after the Mythic Dawn attacked the Emperor and Valen single-handedly fought them off? Just shut up and drink, Romlyn.
Ungrien! I just found another spoiled keg! What's the matter with you?
I... I'm sorry. I could have sworn I sealed it.
Tell me something. Do you enjoy spending Lady Maven's gold for her? It certainly seems that way.
This is the last warning. You do it again, and you'll be sleeping in Beggar's Row with the rest of the riff-raff!
Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!
That s'wit. One day, he'll regret pushing all of us around.
What do you mean?
All I'm saying is Indaryn's going to push someone too far one day and they're going to push back... hard.
I don't know if I can stand the abuse here much longer. They treat us like outcasts.
The Dark Elves and the Wood Elves have never been the best of friends. Be patient, they'll come around soon enough!
Wretched Dark Elves. It's just my luck I ended up working under one of them.
Chin up, Ungrien! Remember, you have a roof over your head and food in your belly thanks to the very same Dark Elves. Be thankful.
You keep giving and giving Bersi, and they'll keep taking and taking. When is it going to end?
What would you have me do, woman? Cross the Guild? Take them all on one by one?
You know I don't mean that. We need to find a way out of this. Perhaps talk to Laila...
Laila is as clueless as she is stupid. No. If anything's to be done about this, we have to deal with it ourselves.
Drifa? I was looking through our books and there's an entry for [QUOTE]spices.[QUOTE] Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?
Spices? I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about.
You sure? It was in your handwriting. If you can't keep the books straight then let me do them.
Oh, yes... spices. That was a special order for someone in Whiterun. Should be along any day now. Don't let it worry you, my dear.
Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?
I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant.
Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear?
Accentuate disgust when saying [QUOTE]mother[QUOTE]
Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me.
Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.
I know that!
I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked.
Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace.
I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son.
I understand, mother. Forgive me.
They laughed at me again, Dinya. They simply don't understand.
I'm so sorry my husband. You must remember, they're at the Bee and Barb to drink, not to listen to a sermon.
Yes, yes, I know. I just wish to show them there's more to life than drowning your sorrows in a goblet of mead.
You're a good man, Maramal. We're lucky to have you watching over us.
It fills me with joy to hear you're with child, Dinya. They said it wouldn't... that it couldn't happen, but Mara has shown them they're mistake.
And to think I was wandering the ash wastes only two years ago. I never knew my path would lead to you.
You were guided here; you were always meant to be here. That's the way of things.
Then I thank Lady Mara with all my heart; for you, for our child and for our love.
How are things at the Meadery, my dear?
Not this again...
Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak.
It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all.
Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven.
Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil.
Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business.
It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn.
Mother, what can I do to make father happier? It seems no matter how successful I become he doesn't care.
Of course he cares. You just have to understand that your father was a soldier and he'll always be a soldier.
He just wants you to follow in his footsteps.
I understand. It just isn't me. I'm not a warrior and I don't think I ever will be.
Then by Talos, you do what you feel you're meant to do. I'll take care of your father for you.
You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.
It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight for to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?
That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.
You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people; to fight to keep us free.
You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land.
No. I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste.
Aunt Haelga, why you... demean yourself with these people you barely know? They show no real love for you.
It's only a bit of fun. You're a lovely young thing, you should try it sometime.
No! I'm saving myself for someone special. Someone who loves me dearly.
You mean Sibbi? You must be joking! All he wants to do is bed you and be done with it. You may as well get it over with and let him.
You're wrong! Sibbi and I are in love and you're just jealous!
Svana! Has that skooma-addled idiot Niluva paid us her rent yet? Or does she have more excuses?
She said she'll have it soon. She still has her job at the meadery for now, so she'll be able to pay us.
Why do you insist on defending that woman? All she does with her money is spend it on that Dark Elf garbage!
Just be patient, aunt. She'll have it, I promise.
Hey, Svana... I hear you like Dark Elves. Perhaps I could should you what a real Dark Elf can do to you.
You're an animal, Tythis... keep away from me.
Ah, so my reputation as a lover precedes me. Care to reconsider?
You're disgusting! Don't you even think of laying a finger on me or I'll cut off something you can't live without.
So, Brand-Shei... business as awful for you as it is for all of us?
Worse. The Khajiit Caravans are the only way to get supplies into the city, and even those are becoming more infrequent.
louder, not shouting, but want to be heard - also, very sarcastic
Grelka! Lower your voice before you get us both in trouble.
Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!
Take it easy, father. You're making a scene.
I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!
Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!
Yes... father.
You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us.
Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.
I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly.
Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart.
Romlyn, I've been meaning to speak to you. I did a count at the meadery and we're four cases short... again.
What are you saying? You think I had something to do with that?
I'm not accusing you of anything. Yet.
The Dreth family doesn't steal, Indaryn.
For your sake, I hope you're right. Because if it is you, and Maven finds out, the Dreth family is going to be one member smaller.
Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment.
We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.
I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family.
Anything you say, Mother.
Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?
I've known Bersi a long time. Even before he opened that rubbish heap he calls a shop.
Give him one more week to think about it.
And if he still refuses?
Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.
I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me.
It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says [QUOTE]sand elske.[QUOTE]
I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.
Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.
Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry.
Ah, Nivenor. What can I sell you on this fine day?
I'm looking for a necklace. Do you have anything with garnets?
I have a single one left, quite expensive, but also quite elegant.
Posh. I'm not paying for it. Put it on Bolli's account if you please.
Madesi, what's this bill for 300 septims!
Begging your pardon, milord. Your wife has run up quite an account in the last few months.
Outrageous! Who does she think she is?!
Lady Haelga, so pleased to see you. Your Marks of Dibella are ready.
Oh, splendid! I can't wait to use them.
Begging your pardon milady... I know these have something to do with Dibella, but whatever are they for?
Maybe I'll show you one day, Madesi. Have them delivered to the Bunkhouse, won't you?
We got a few pieces of jewelry at the Prawn, Madesi. Want to come take a look at them later?
I wish I could, milady. Sadly, I haven't sold enough of my own jewelry let alone buy some from you. I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm certain Bolli would be happy to lend you a few septims.
Much appreciated, Lady Drifa, but I'll manage.
When are you going to stop by the temple, Madesi?
Sorry Lady Dinya, but I've been busy of late.
It only takes but a moment to say a silent prayer to Mara. Please come by soon; not for me, but for yourself.
Very well, I'll try milady.
Lady Maven, how may I help you?
Is it true that you refused to sell one of your... trinkets to Hemming?
Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted!
I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!
Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively.
Hello, Lady Mjoll.
Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?
Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here.
It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know.
Here's another septim, Madesi. How much more do I need?
Only thirty more and it'll be all yours. If I might ask, who is the lucky woman?
It's for Marise, but don't say a word to her!
Don't worry, Shadr, your secret is safe with me.
Anuriel, a word please.
Yes, my lady?
It's been brought to my attention that the poison known as skooma may be present in our city. What do you know of this?
I believe it to be a falsehood perpetrated by the Empire in order to weaken the citizen's confidence in your ability to rule.
Excellent, then they'll be no need to devote any resources to stopping it. Thank you, Anuriel. That will be all.
My lady, Maven Black-Briar has sent word that she requires your seal in order to expand her shipments into Morrowind.
But of course! Tell her she'll have it. Maven is one of the few people I can trust and I'd be delighted to give her my blessing.
Yes, my lady. I will pass the good news on to her.
Mother, how long must we put up with Saerlund spouting his nonsense about the Empire?
What would you have me do, send him to the gallows for treason? He's your brother, Harrald.
My only concern is your safety, mother. One can only imagine the sordid types he may be conspiring with to bring about your downfall.
I will hear no more of this, Harrald. Do you understand me? No more!
Harrald, I have need of you.
Yes mother? What is it?
This situation with the sewers beneath the city. I hear people have entered this place and have gone missing. Do you know of this?
Yes, I've heard such things. Anuriel assures me they're just fabrications and there's nothing down there save a few stray skeever.
Well, make sure we keep the patrols out night and day, just to be certain.
I see you still have the run of the place, traitor.
Come now brother, don't act all high and mighty. I know you could care less about the war one way or another.
The things you say are just an act to please mother.
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
I'm disappointed in you brother. You had it all. You had it all and your mouth cost you everything.
At least I've chosen a side instead of acting like a spectator.
One day, you'll be forced to make a choice. And I hope it's the right one, brother.
So, is this what it's come to? You'd have your own flesh and blood hanged just to solidify your grip as the next Jarl?
If that's what it will take then so be it.
What's become of us? We used to be inseparable... always fighting back to back and letting nothing stand in our way.
You've changed, brother. And not for the better I'm afraid.
I've done what I needed to do keep mother happy. It doesn't matter what I really believe.
You've done what you've had to for yourself, not for mother.
Wise up, Harrald. There's a storm on the horizon and it will blow through here with all its fury. It's time to choose a side.
Unmid, my sweet. Are we still meeting later for... combat training?
Of course. Your training isn't complete yet.
I look forward to it then.
Anuriel, would you please stop declaring that the city is safe for the Jarl to roam? You and I both know that isn't true.
I would never knowingly place Laila in danger, you know that too. Why do you always question my judgment? You don't trust me.
I trust you, I'm just concerned about her safety. That's all. Don't be angry with me.
I'm not angry with you. Tell you what, lover. Meet me in my chambers later and we can discuss the situation in private.
Unmid, I wish to travel about the city. Prepare an escort please.
Begging your pardon my lady, but I strongly recommend against it.
Anuriel seems to think that seeing me on the streets might bolster the city's morale.
My lady, there could be agents of the Empire looking for an opportunity like that to have you killed. Are you willing to take that risk?
No. Of course you're right, Unmid. I'll stay here for now.
Do you realize how delicate the experiment is you've interrupted by sending for me? I may need to throw out the components and start again.
How dare you take that kind of tone. You're in service to me, remember?
I'm sorry my lady. The stresses of all this research... it's becoming more than I can bear.
You're forgiven. Now, I want to know if you've made any progress with my son. Is he cursed? Has he been possessed?
Sorry, my lady. I've been looking but I'm convinced Saerlund says truly believes what he is saying.
Very well. Keep at it. You may go.
Steady. I don't know what's happening. Let's watch and wait.
Wait. Something's happening... gods above!

Prepare to die!
This is the end for you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
You won't live to see tomorrow!
I can take you!
You can't beat me!
This ends now!
Victory or Sovngarde!
I'll make you pay!
You've already lost!
You don't have a chance!
I'll see you in pieces!
There's no escape!
Show me what you've got!
Put up a real fight!
I've fought worse than you!
You're nothing, hear me? Nothing!

Time for you to die!
You think you stand a chance?
Going to enjoy killing you!
Foul blood drinker!
bitter, sarcastic
I am the one cursed by Malacath. It is my burden. I bear it, and continue to lead, and the others see how strong I am. That is how I rule.
Are you blind, or just stupid? You think the tribe has not seen you talking to me? You think they would not know?
Do not mistake our life for one of stupidity. It would be the last mistake you make.
Hrmph. Breaking a curse is not a simple thing. It is dangerous.
But... To have won against Malacath himself... That would be seen as real power.
Perhaps... Perhaps it might. If nothing else, you could be an excellent sacrifice to Malacath.
You really want to help? You go offer yourself at Malacath's Shrine. Petition him for help.
He might not devour you whole.
You persist? Fine. You go tell Malacath to lift this curse from me. See how well he listens to you.
Offer yourself up as a sacrifice while you're there.
What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!
You want me to let a dragon into the heart of my city, with the threat of war on my doorstep?
Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?
The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead.
But they don't say how he does this.
frowning
I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you.
An unguessed trove of lost lore... but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew.
Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.
Od - Ah - Viing. [QUOTE]Winged Snow Hunter,[QUOTE] as I read it.
I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.
What do you think the Imperials would be doing while this dragon is busy slaughtering my men?
Do you think the Stormcloaks will sit idle while this dragon is slaughtering my men and burning down my city?
Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move.
Do you think they will sit idle while a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city?
No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.
Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme.
But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep.

According to legend. Although I never thought to put the tale to the test.
Jarl Olaf One-Eye it was, who later became High King.
They say he Shouted it into submission in single combat atop Mount Anthor and brought it back to Whiterun.
Numinex was the dragon's name. That's his skull decorating the main hall.
Why, why have you done this to us?
I cannot protect you if you murder us. This is the only warning you will receive.

It is time, Yamarz.
You bring an outsider here, and now insist I call on Malacath for help, when he has clearly forsaken me? You try my patience, Atub.
Doing nothing will not grant our tribe relief from this curse. We must try.
Grrr. Fine, let's get this over with.
Ain't used to strangers here in Riverwood.
I'm spoken for, you know. So don't get any ideas.
You're pretty, I'll give ya that. Just stay away from my husband, Alvor.
Alvor and I, we got a daughter. Little Dorthe.
He would dote on her so much. Let her work the forge and everything. I miss him so.
My girl likes to work the forge with her papa.
All of that blacksmithing... It's not good for a little girl. Ain't... ladylike.
Dorthe needs to spend more time in the garden. I could use the help.
It don't matter what I grow - my Alvor, he'll eat anything.
Maybe I'll do turnips next. Hmmm... Or maybe radishes?
New to Riverwood? If you're looking for work, go see Hod at the mill.
We're a small village, but we work hard, and take care of our own.
I own the lumber mill, and pay a fair wage. See my husband Hod if you're looking for work.
Only worry we've got is the war reaching this far.
Years past, the lumber was used for houses or furniture. Now, the soldiers just buy it all.
The thought of my wood being used for weapons... Makes me sick.
No use thinkin' of things I can't change. Too much work to be done...
You look like a traveler. Someone that has seen far away places and heard new stories.
You should come hear me play at the Sleeping Giant Inn. For a small sum you can even pick the song.
I've been trained as a skald, as was my father, and my father's father before him.
My time at the Bards College was brief. A prodigy has little need for formal education.
I'm composing a new song. A ballad, for Camilla Valerius.
Some day Camilla will know of my affections. Some day...
A new face. And a right fair one at that.
A new face. And a right ugly one at that. No offence.
Got business here in Riverwood, eh? There are worse villages.
At least the damned war hasn't gotten here. Yet.
We work hard, try to do right by our families.
Me, I've got my axe, my wife Gerdur and my boy Frodnar. That's all I need.
Woodcutting's my trade. Best log splitter from here to Riften.
It's all in the way you hold the axe. Caress it, like any wench, and she'll do ya right.
You met Camilla yet? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on those trunks. He he he he.
Now you, lass... You've got some beautiful trunks yourself... Hmm?
Well... I'll let you go about your business.
You're new around here, so I'll go easy on ya. But don't get on my bad side.
Get me mad, and I'll prank ya. And not a little. A lot.
Ah, everybody around here's so serious.
So I like to have a little fun, so what?
My friend Dorthe doesn't like my pranking. [QUOTE]You're being mean, Frodnar![QUOTE] So what if I am?
Mother wants me to work at the mill. But I ain't nobody's slave.
You gotta have better things to do than talk to me all day...
Did I see you talking to Sven? Maybe not. Maybe...nevermind. But I would stay away from him if I were you.
Greetings, sister Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.
Greetings, brother Elf. Good to see a familiar face so far from home.
Riverwood's agreeable enough, I suppose. For a Nord village.
There's beauty here unmatched in all of Skyrim, to be sure.
Maybe you've already met Camilla Valerius?
If only Camilla shared my affections. Or even knew about them.
Are you a hunter, by chance? The hills surrounding the village are ripe with game.
I work at the lumber mill, but I escape into the forest whenever possible.
I miss Valenwood, but the wilds here are... serviceable.
I don't like to brag, but I once took down a bear at three hundred yards. In a blizzard.
We got rooms and food. Drink, too. I cook. Ain't much else to tell.
Need a room, talk to Delphine.
I'm just the cook, lad.
I'm just the cook, lass.
I ain't lookin' to make friends.
You like Skeever liver. No? Tough luck.
Food's hot. Never said it was good.
You're that visitor, been pokin' around.
I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.
We don't get a lot of travelers here in Riverwood.
The war keeps most folks away, these days.
Most of my customers are locals, come to relax after a hard day's toil.
So what's your story? Just here to... relax?
You look like you could use an ale.
If you're staying the night, I've got a free room.
Wanderer like you must have quite an appetite. Some food?
You're a strapping young man. Don't be a stranger.
The men here like my attention, and I like theirs. Best know your place.
You're not from around here. That makes two of us.
I came here from the Imperial Province, to work with my brother Lucan.
It got bad back in Cyrodiil. The war with the Thalmor ruined... everything.
I came to Skyrim looking for a better life. So what did I get? Another war.
I just want to find a good husband, and start a family of my own.
The Riverwood Trader is everything you need in a general store.
My sister Camilla or I will be happy to help you.
Maybe you're looking for something... particular?
We carry just about anything you could need...
I know some of it looks like junk, but everything's a treasure in the right light.
Ain't every day we get visitors in Riverwood.
Whatever you need. By Ysmir, if it's simple and strong, I can forge it.
You lookin' for a new blade?
Iron or steel is what you need. Leave that fancy Elven stuff to the Elves.
Iron and steel mostly. I might even have some of your fancy Elven pieces lying around somewhere...
I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.
You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere...
Papa says I'm too friendly with strangers, but you seem all right.
My father is Alvor, the blacksmith. I'm his assistant. I mean, apprentice.
Some day I'm going to forge my own sword!
Papa says I'm not ready for weapons. So I make lots of horseshoes and hobnails.
Mama doesn't think I'm girlish enough. But that's just stupid girl talk.
Papa may have wanted a son, but he got me. He's a lucky man.
Ain't nothin' a boy can do that I can't do better.
Nobody believes me, but I tell you, I saw a dragon!
By Shor, what do you want?
It's my boy Sven you need to listen to. He sings at the inn, most every night.
Sven has the voice of a snow lark. Only good thing he got from his father.
My boy fancies that Camilla Valerius. She'll come around soon enough.
Camilla, I've seen her talking to that Faendal. Filthy elf needs to keep to his own kind...
What happened to my Skyrim? Everywhere you look, cats, lizards and elves. It's sickening.
I raised my Sven to be strong, and proud. A true Nord.
You're kinda fuzzy. What's wrong with ya?
Outta my way, stranger.
Word is Ulfric Stormcloak escaped from the Imperials. War's only going to get worse, now.
They say a dragon attacked Helgen. Sounds like hogwash to me.
We've got something of a love triangle here in Riverwood. Faendal and Sven, both vying for Camilla's affections.
Many years ago I lost my blade, [QUOTE]Grimsever,[QUOTE] within a Dwemer ruin. I took it as a sign that I was wasting my days in search of wealth.
You and I are alike. We seek challenge and great fortune. But for me, that's where the similarities end.
You see, Riften is my great beast to be slain and my fortune comes from gratitude and trust.
Its been difficult. I've taken the burdens of this city's problems upon myself and I keep running into impossible obstacles.
Corruption, lies and deceit are the order of the day here.
If it wasn't for Aerin, the young man who saved my life, I think I'd already have given up long ago.
I was adventuring in the depths of the ruins when I was attacked by a massive construct... like nothing I had ever seen.
When the colossus struck, Grimsever was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly.
It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the Dwemer abomination and make my way to the surface.
I must have collapsed, because the next thing I remember is Aerin standing over me tending to my wounds.
It was lost years ago in a Dwemer ruin.
Without it, I feel almost as defenseless as a newborn. I don't think I'll ever be able to find a replacement.
I couldn't ask you to undertake such a trecherous journey, it would be a fool's errand.
But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away.
Grimsever rests with the Dwemer ruin of Mzinchaleft. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life.
Yes, quite a shame. It was a fine weapon.
To call it a guild is ridiculous. How can people who would betray one another over a gold coin be considered part of an association?
They're the worst kind. Even the Dark Brotherhood abides by a strict set of rules and tradition. These thieves are just rabble.
What do you think?
Hardly! In fact, I don't know how I get anything done with all of the distractions I have to put up with.
My wife Hafjorg, well, she's a necessary evil I suppose. Not a lick of talent when it comes to alchemy, but she keeps me fed.
Then there's Ingun Black-Briar. Bright young thing and a worthy apprentice, when she isn't wasting my rare ingredients.
Keerava, we're running low on Black-Briar Mead.
If only Maven would stop raising the price on it maybe I could afford to stock more cases.
We could always look for another brand.
That isn't an option. Maven sees me serve a competitor's brand here and we may as well dig our own graves.
Don't worry, the time will come when we can walk away from here.
I hope so. I can't stand this city anymore.
Damn it, Talen. We still don't have enough this year to get out of Riften.
Why don't they listen to me, Keerava? Why won't they do as I say?
Maybe they're afraid of you. Maybe it's your breath. How should I know?
They always try to take advantage of me. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.
I'll tell you one thing, if you don't make peace with them soon you may get a walkout on your hands. Then we're both in trouble.
Talen my friend, up for some fishing this week?
I don't know Bolli. It's getting dangerous outside the walls.
Oh come now, what's a dragon or two compared to a day full of fishing!
That's not funny, Bolli. People are scared.
with grudging respect (and fear)
But I am Al-du-in, Firstborn of Akatosh! Mulaagi zok lot! I cannot be slain here, by you or anyone else!
Die now and await your fate in Sovngarde!

How are the headaches, dear? You or your mother still having them?
Oh, yes. All the time. They come with the visions, as always.
Are you sure you don't want something for them? I may be able to brew you something to help.
Oh no! I couldn't. Mother says they are a burden we must bear for our gift.
Well dear, you know where to find me if it ever becomes too much for you.
When I grow up, will I go to the College in Winterhold?
No, I don't think that will be necessary.
But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?
The College is not the only place to learn about magic.
But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?
I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.
That is enough.
Have you been working on your concentration?
Yes sir, I have.
Good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magical forces.
Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and yield.
Have no fear. I believe it is within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!
I had a bad dream again last night.
I dreamt that you went away. You made monsters.
It's just a dream, child. Nothing more.
It was scary. It was like it was real!
Hush now. Think no more of it.
How are you feeling?
Do you need anything? Are you hungry?
Oh Hroggar, you know I'm always hungry. Don't worry, I'll eat when I need to.
Oh, look! We have company!
Jonna, do you think the townspeople are warming to my serenades?
No. They ain't. And they aren't gonna. If you weren't payin' for your room, I'd have thrown you out a long time ago.
Yes, but they'll come around eventually. You'll see.
Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if they come 'round. And if you're never seen or heard from agin.
I'm thinking of composing a song about you, Jonna. Would you prefer that I proclaim your beauty, your strength, your...
Nah. Just... don't. Leave me outta it.
No interest in being immortalized in song? Remembered and praised for all eternity?
No. I mean it.
When I'm known throughout Tamriel, you'll regret this decision.
Ho, Gorm.
Buy you a drink?
Not right now. Anything new?
Still the same. I tell you, something's got to be done.
When the time is right, friend. When we're sure.
The longer we wait, the worse it gets.
Let's talk about it some other time.

Don't know why you're asking me. But I'm glad that damn Imperial is gone. Something wrong about him.
I swear that woman Aeri doesn't appreciate all the work I do for her damn mill.
Watch your mouth with me you pup! Who do you think you are?
The man doing your job?
It's an old city. Legends say Dwarves built it first. Then after they vanished, the natives moved in.
Finally, the Nords took over around Tiber Septim's time. That bent a few folks' arms the wrong way.
That's right, at least according to them scholars. Stonework's clearly not Nord, that much is for sure.
Old Elven fella named Calcelmo is up in Understone Keep's the one you want to talk to for more about that. Wrote all those books.
That's right. Whole group of the natives called the Forsworn rose up against the Nords. Drove them out.
Then Ulfric Stormcloak came with his militia. That must have been a sight to see, him shouting folks to death.
You'd think that'd be the end of it, but those Forsworn are still in the hills, and they're as wild as wolves.
I'm Anska.  Are you here to help?
If Vokun is as powerful as I think, I may need a little help um ... dealing ...with him.
You can have anything except the scroll of course.
Oh alright.  Well I'll be here for a bit if you change your mind.
Don't fall.
That would be Jarl Igmund. Young for a ruler of a Hold, especially the Reach.
Wasn't surprising he stayed loyal to the Empire. His father helped capture Ulfric Stormcloak after the Markarth Incident.
Since the Stormcloaks took over, Jarl Thongvor is in charge.
It'll be lean times for the Reach with a Silver-Blood ruling it, that's for certain.
It's the whole reason Ulfric revolted against the Empire. Well, the first reason anyway.
Forsworn had taken over Markarth, and Ulfric and his men drove them out. Empire promised they'd be free to worship Talos afterwards.
Pity no one told the Elves. Whole group of those Thalmor came and they demanded Ulfric's arrest.
Before the Nords came, we worshipped the old gods, had our own kingdom.
Times have been good and bad since then, but some folks couldn't handle not ruling their own land. Those are the Forsworn.
The Forsworn follow the old ways, but some of those were best forgotten. Blood sacrifices, communing with Daedra. It's the road to ruin.
Is there something you need, dear?
I... I'm not sure. I think perhaps, but I don't know what it is.
All right, can you describe it to me?
No, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll know it if I find it. Does that make sense?
If it does to you, dear, that's all that matters.
Why does Alduin hang back? We've staked everything on this plan of yours, old man.
He will come. He cannot ignore our defiance. And why should he fear us, even now?
We've bloodied him well. Four of his kin have fallen to my blade alone this day.
shaking his head in sorrow over the fall of these great champions
They did not have Dragonrend. Once we bring him down, I promise I will have his head.
Felldir! We agreed not to use it!
No. We will deal with Alduin ourselves, here and now.
You do not understand. Alduin cannot be slain like a lesser dragon. He is beyond our strength.
We shall see soon enough. Alduin approaches!

It's no use! Use the Scroll, Felldir! Now!
Hold, Alduin on the Wing! Sister Hawk, grant us your sacred breath to make this contract heard!

wearily, regretting what he's done now that it's done
It's a small town, with one rather unique feature - it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost.
It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit.
Yes. Do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting.
There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro and the Stormcloaks in the Emperor's assassination.
Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun.
Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.
No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option...
We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial...
Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine.
I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on.
I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong.
emphasis on [QUOTE]anything[QUOTE]
Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able.
Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?
Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon.
If you're trying to ask if I tend the hall of the dead alone, then the answer is yes.
change voice in last quote as if mimicking someone else
Look, I didn't ask for this job, I got stuck with it thanks to my father.
My father was a Priest of Arkay. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers.
I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with [QUOTE]the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?[QUOTE]
So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.
I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker.
I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.
I hadn't asked you because I was afraid you'd say no. I appreciate your help.
Here, I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest.
Yes. Perhaps one day I'll be able to make the journey, but for now I need to tend the dead.
I felt a caress on my cheek some time ago... I thought it to be a trick of the wind, but I think it was a message from my father.
We've made peace with one another without even uttering a single word and I'm content for the first time in my life.
I thank you. Here, please accept this as a token of my appreciation for your selfless action.
Someone actually interested in what I'm doing? Amazing! Well, allow me to explain.
My experimentation involves a magical construct and a reagent that will allow the construct to maintain a field of permanent harmonic energy!
You don't have to, because it's utter nonsense. It's never going to work.
No, no, no. What I need to do is to reverse that. Draw the harmonic energy into the reagent and then apply it with the proper incantation.
What was I thinking? It would never work that first way. Why didn't you tell me?
I'll tell you why you won't tell me. Because you were absolutely right not to.
It's a fundamental rule of magic and it would be ridiculous. You can't draw from harmonic energy without a soul siphon.
What's not to get? It's as simple as Traven's First Axiom of Magic... or was it Galerion's Law of Casting. Hmm.
I'll tell you what, let me find out where that's from. I'll need to look through my library... and get you an answer.
Umm... what were we talking about?
Yes, I could use some help with that. An assistant perhaps? No, no, no. Maybe a familiar. No, too messy.
Well, at any rate, organization is not my strong suit. Not at all. I need as much help as I can get.
In fact, if you could retrieve a few things for me, I could start on my next set of experiments.
I had a look at that boneyard the other day, Vantus. The one to the Northwest.
I told you I don't like you going there. I've seen scavengers picking at the mammoths. They could be dangerous.
inquisitive herbalist
Oh, half the field should do.
Half the field? What could need half the field?
I just think pollinating would be easier if I could do a lot of plants at once.
Uh... why don't we talk about this later?
As you can imagine, I tend to forget things often. Leave things around. I really must learn to put these things away.
What I need is my Dwemer Stirring Spoon, my Orichalcum Ingot and my Grand Soul Gem. In fact, I could use them immediately.
Bring those items back to me and I'll be happy to experiment on you. No, no... that isn't right. I'd be happy to reward you.
Excellent. I can't wait.
Well... why are you still standing here? Oh, right. You need to know where they are! That would help.
A shame. Perhaps another time then.
Let's see. Last time I used the Dwemer Spoon was at my dear friend Boti's house in Ivarstead... Fellstar Farm I believe it's called.
The orichalcum ingot should still be in Winterhold at the Frozen Hearth Inn. I don't know why I didn't just take it with me.
And last is the soul gem. I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.
Items? What items? Let me see those.
Hmm. I'm not sure how you managed it, but these are exactly what I need to start my next set of experiments. Wonderful!
Well, at least allow me to reward you for your uncanny foresight.
When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die.
Think the guards will be coming down, soon?
Ah, it's not been more than a few days since they came down the last time.
Think maybe we should jump the guards when they come down next?
They keep the doors locked when they come down. You kill them, you're trapping us here with no food.
Nearly broke my back out in the mines today. Damn Nords should bleed for putting us through this!
Some day, brother. Some day.
Have any skooma? I need to get something from Grisvar.
You make one move towards my skooma, and I shiv you.
player didn't listen to a cardinal rule
It annoys you that those shopkeepers never paid
veiled warning
Here's the big picture. He helped Alduin enslave our ancestors. He may have betrayed Alduin in the end, but that makes him worse, not better.
We can't afford to give Paarthurnax the opportunity to betray us in turn, and return to his old master.
Paarthurnax was the author of many atrocities during the Dragon War - crimes great enough to be remembered for thousands of years.
True, he turned traitor to Alduin and helped overthrow the Dragon Cult, but that does not excuse or expiate his previous deeds.
Whether or not he has truly repented, or merely acted to save himself, justice demands that he pay with his life.
Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called [QUOTE]The Dreamstride[QUOTE]; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.
I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore.
Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person.
Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into a ingestible liquid.
As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests of Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.
I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago.
But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.
No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink.
The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste.
I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.
Have you decided to do the right thing, Dragonborn?
I wish there were another way, Dragonborn, but it falls to you to serve justice upon Paarthurnax.
Make your choice, Dragonborn. You're either with us or against us.
Justice can be harsh. But it is still justice. Paarthurnax deserves to die.
I knew we could count on you! Glad to have you back on our side.
At long last. An ancient evil is avenged. The shades of many Blades salute you this day.
There's one more thing. We know about Paarthurnax.
I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
I'm afraid there's a problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.
Paarthurnax. The dragon, that the Greybeards have been protecting for all these years.
He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War.
That's fine. We needed his help. Now we don't, and it's long past time for him to pay for his crimes.
And he's not just any dragon. He was the right hand of Alduin.
He committed atrocities so infamous they are still remembered, thousands of years later.
All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities?
It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years.
He needs to die. He deserves to die. And it falls to you to kill him.
not really sorry. she's pissed off about Paarthurnax.
The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors.
Justice demands that he die for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.
Ah, you're back. I hope you've made some progress on tracking down this Shout we need to defeat Alduin?
Ah, indeed? There's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. Let me think...
Perhaps the College of Winterhold. What learning there is in Skyrim is gathered there.
One of the mages there may be able to put you on the trail of this Elder Scroll.
Ah, indeed. Well there's a pretty puzzle. Not the kind of thing you'll find in your local bookshop. I'm sure you'll manage, though.
Not a single man or woman in Dawnstar has gotten a good night's rest in days. We keep having the same nightmare, over and over.
If people aren't tired, they're angry, and if they aren't angry, they're afraid. It's made keeping order a mess.
I hear Mara has sent one of her priests to the inn to try to calm people down, but I don't know how much words will do now.
That's right. Dawnstar. My Dawnstar is plagued with nightmares. I haven't slept properly in days.
That priest of Mara who came here before you says the Divines will cure us.
Well, until they do, I don't have any business to discuss with outsiders.
You haven't heard? All of Dawnstar hasn't had a decent night's rest in days.
People are having nightmares they swear are real. They go to bed, but they wake up more tired than yesterday.
I've heard that a priest of Mara has come, saying that the Divines will lift this curse somehow, but that remains to be seen.
Nightmares. I haven't met a single man or woman who doesn't admit to having them.
A bad dream I can handle, but everyone having the same bad dream, every night? It's a curse, I say.
I hear there's a priest of Mara visiting the inn. Maybe the Divines will cure us.
It's these nightmares. Me and every one of my workers can't catch a nod without having one.
They're almost... real. They say a priest of Mara has arrived in town. We'll see if faith can cure this curse.
New in town? You're lucky. Dreams aren't affecting travelers.
Everyone else though.... They're horrible. Imagine dying over and over again in your dreams night after night.
They say a priest of Mara is visiting the Windpeak Inn. Says the Divines will take care of everything. We'll see about that.
Everyone here is having nightmares. I have miners tripping over their own feet from lack of sleep.
I heard there was a Priest of Mara who was supposed to be looking into it. We'll see if anything comes of that.
cynical, demagogue
They drink all day and night and what do I do?
Why do they need me to do this?  We use magic, not weapons.
I swear they're making me do this for a laugh. At least I'm not dealing with the prisoners down below.
I bet Naris gets a kick out it. Nasty fella he is.
rolling your eyes - you've been listening to your friend complain about the same thing over and over
Yeah, I don't know how I feel about what goes on down there.
I work the forge.
You better quiet down before you end up there. Then I'd have to work the forge.
Talking to yourself.
Ask Esbern. If he doesn't know himself, he'll know where to find it out.
Such blasphemies are the calling of mages, not followers of the Way.
Take your question to the College of Winterhold. They may be able to help you.
Were the Greybeards any help? Did they know this anything about the Shout used against Alduin?
An Elder Scroll? That's not going to be easy to come by.
Esbern's your man for that kind of thing. He may be able to at least point you in the right direction.
skeptically - you think the player's evading the question
Did he, now? That doesn't sound like my nephew at all. I doubt he'd be mixed up with the likes of you.
Now that the Imperial blight has poisoned Riften, the worship of Talos is strictly forbidden by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.
They can defile our shrine, they can arrest our people and they can silence our voices, but the Empire will never destroy our spirit.
As long as we keep Talos in our heart, his legacy will never die.
Mara is the handmaiden of Kyne, the Goddess of the Storm and the Mother of Men.
She is the bearer of love and the patron of marriage.
If you wish to make a donation to her Benevolence, speak to Maramal and ensure your true love will endure for all eternity.
Such a shame. Perhaps another time then.
Almost anyone in Riften is in dire need of those missives. Speak to them, child. You will know who will listen and who will sin.
A word of advice, keep away from the Keep and the city guards. They follow their own path and have already forsaken Her.
Work? I suppose you can call it that. I call it slavery. I work my fingers to the bone keeping this disgusting place clean.
Ever since my parents died and Haelga took me in, it's been a nightmare. How was I to know she was such a wretched woman?
So now I'm stuck living here while those pigs she calls customers grope me and say the most awful things.
It's not just the work, it's everything about her. She's disgusting. I think she takes her worship of Dibella a bit too seriously.
Do you know she's slept with three different men in the last month alone? What kind of a woman would do such a thing?
Just for once, I'd like to see her squirm... to rub her nose in it.
Actually, there is, but I don't think I could get away with doing it. She'd kill me if she found out.
You see, I happen to know after she makes love, she gives her partner a token of her affection called a Mark of Dibella.
If you confront her with three of the Marks, she'd be so embarrassed... well, I don't know what she'd do!
Oh, this is going to be great!
You need to get the Marks of Dibella from Bolli, Hofgrir and Indaryn. Not sure how you're going to do that, but try your best.
Then just confront Haelga with them and the rest works itself out.
Yeah, you're right. Maybe it's not the best idea.
What? How... where did you get these?
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Look, we need to keep this quiet... between you and me, okay. No one else needs to know about it.
If word got out that I'm practicing my Dibellan Arts in Riften, they'll run me out of town.
Here, take this and don't mention a word of this to anyone, especially Svana!
Oh I know. Isn't it wonderful? I bet she squirmed like a skeever when you pulled them out of your pocket.
I think things are going to be a lot different around here from now on and I have you to thank for it.
Here, I want you to have this. It was my father's but I'm certain you'll put it to good use.
I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd never sleep with anyone besides my good wife, Drifa.
Huh? What are you talking about? I don't even know what that is.
You're crazy! How dare you make such an accusation!
Look, it was one night, okay? I think she slipped something in my drink. I haven't even been back to the Bunkhouse since.
Just take this damn thing. I never want to see it again.
I don't want a bad reputation in Riften, but Haelga's out of control. She wanted to try it in the stables so I said yes.
If you want the mark that badly then go ahead and take it.
If word gets around that I bedded her, they'll lose all respect for me at the meadery.
Take the mark if you want it. It's not worth all this hassle anyway.
Hand what over? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Look, you must have me confused with someone else.
You aren't making any sense. Hand what over?
Or else what? You don't scare me.
You have a death wish or something?
You're threatening me? Oh, that's rich!
I should say so.
Next time think before you speak.
You've got some nerve.
Bolli is a good man, he pays us well and watches out for us.
I used to work at the Black-Briar Meadery, but Indaryn and I never saw eye-to-eye. That elf has no patience at all.
It's probably for the best anyway; I'm far better at fishing than working in a meadery.
My job at the Riften Fishery is in danger. The owner, Bolli, said that if I show up for work in this condition one more time, then I'm out.
I don't mean to do this to myself, but I can't help it. I tried some skooma a year ago, and ever since then, I can't stop!
If you could give me a healing potion, I could cleanse this poison from my body and get back to my life.
Your kindness will never be forgotten.
Here, take this. It's all I can offer for what you've given me.
Very well. I suppose I'll just curl up somewhere until this passes as usual.
I can't get it open.
You've been at it for five minutes. Here, let me try.
I think I almost got it.
Come on, just open.
You are slightly annoyed that you're in this together.
Shushing, annoyed
You're eager to get to the looting, but trying to advocate patience.
You're eager for some adventure. - more enthusiasm than caution
This place is sure to make us rich!
Gloating Betrayal
There's just one more thing I need from you. To fully absorb Gathrik's power I require a blood sacrifice.
Your blood should be good enough. This will go easier for us both if you don't bother fighting back.
I don't know. Beem-Ja has looked after me since I was knee-high to him. I need to rest, and then I think I'm going back to High Rock.
The first part is a bit snippy, but then you fade into your sadness.
Start with a [QUOTE]just...[QUOTE] Firm but not unkind.
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you. I'd almost given up hope.
I'm not sure what it's made from, but I can tell you that once you've had a taste, you'll never crave anything else.
The Dunmer came up with the stuff a long time ago. Very illegal and very hard to come by.
I got mine off of a merchant ship in Solitude. Worst mistake I ever made.
Good. Now get going.
Yes. I had Falk call you back because you were at the summoning, you have a connection to Potema now. You must deal with her.
I can provide you with help for her minions though.  This should help you deal with the Catacombs themselves.
What, did you suddenly grow a conscience? Suit yourself.
Let's hope we succeed.
This is our only chance.
I... I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped.
I have no idea what to do!
What's the Jarl going to do about it?
How are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?
Please, enough already!
I have told Idgrod of your concerns. She'll look after you all. Please, go back to your business.
We've no need for wizards in our midst!
Morthal has enough problems as it is!
Ah, you saw that, did you?
Life in Morthal has been troubled lately. The people are uncertain, restless. They merely look to the Jarl for leadership.
There's news of rebellion against the Empire. Strange noises have been heard in the marshes at night.
And then, the tragedy with Hroggar's home.
The men simply seek wisdom. Everything will be fine.
The world's going mad, and our Jarl does what?
She hides inside with her 'visions'. We need a leader, not some mystic!
The world's going mad, and our Jarl doesn't care. She's only in it for herself.
If she's the best Ulfric has to offer, we might've been better off with the Imperials.
How can I?
She never speaks with us. She's allowed this wizard, Falion, to live in our midst practicing gods-know-what.
And now there's talk of rebellion, and dragons? What help could Idgrod be against them?
No, we can only rely on ourselves. You'd do well to remember that.
That is a LOT of blood. To self. Maybe a person in shock.
Talking to self. Hurt and pondering chances of survival
Talking to self. Badly wounded and alone.
Calling out to the player, from a distance

You'd really risk your life for a stranger's honor? I don't even know what to say. Thank you, my friend. I'll wait here.
They're the rulers of the Aldmeri Dominion - what used to be the Imperial provinces of Summerset Isle and Valenwood.
The Thalmor take the arrogance of high elves to the extreme - they believe they are the rightful rulers of all of Tamriel.
For a century or more, the Thalmor had been picking away at the Empire. Valenwood was the first, then the province of Elsweyr.
But even the Blades didn't see the Great War coming. We underestimated the Thalmor, and they destroyed us.
They're the high elves that rule the Aldmeri Dominion. Sworn enemies of the Empire and everything it stands for.
Thirty years ago, they invaded the Empire and came close to destroying it. They smashed the Blades in the process.
Since then, they've been working to weaken the Empire any way they can.
We need to find out if the Thalmor are behind the dragons coming back. We need to get into the Thalmor Embassy, somehow...
Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor.
Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is.
So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong.
So you really are...
I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.
That would be a bad idea. I'd be too likely to attract the wrong kind of attention. But they don't know you at all, yet.
So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone.
We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better.
Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do.
He's a wood elf - the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about.
Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties.
Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards.
That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm.
Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.
Sounds good. Be careful.
last sentence is almost muttering to himself in dismay
If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly.
Ah! A fellow latecomer to Elenwen's little soiree.
And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir!
And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, my good lady!
My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late.
I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking.
There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?
I will just... rest here a moment. Although it is damnably cold out here. I don't look forward to the trip back down...
Perhaps we might share a carriage after the party?
I know, I know - we've just met. But think, by the time the party is over we'll no doubt be fast friends. I look forward to it.
Please. Take your time.
Don't mind me. I'm perfectly insensible to the cold.
I'll go after you. Although these fellows know me. I never miss one of Elenwen's parties, you see.
Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please.
less politely - starting to get icy
politely
Thank you, sir. Go right in.
Thank you, ma'am. Go right in.
Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation.
slightly suspiciously
Awful damn cold up here. And only the guests are allowed inside. Damn foreigners and their inhospitable ways.
What are you out here talking to me for? Party's inside.
I'm paid to wait to take you home. Enjoy yourself.
The lady's already paid the fee. We leave when she gives the word.
I'm just doing my duty, sir.
military formality with just a hint of sarcasm
Oh, it's you again. What in blazes do you want?
If you've got the coin, you're welcome here. Otherwise, hit the road.
What can I get you? Mead? Wine?
Looking for a place to stay?
You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Keerava.
Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milord. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.
Welcome to the Bee and Barb, milady. If I can interest you in one of our special drinks, you let me know.
Is there something I do for you?
Be brief Imperial, there's only so long I can stand being downwind of your stench.
Ah! A fellow Nord! I trust you're bringing the fight to the Empire.
If your allegiance lies with the Empire, we haven't much to discuss.
Hm. You're not from around here. Imperial spy perhaps?
How can a humble servant of Talos help you today?
Blessings of Talos upon you.
Blessings upon you, traveler.
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you much right now... I'm currently in mourning.
You've caught me at a bad time. I've lost someone dear to me.
Yes? What is it?
I'm the brewmaster around here. What did you want?
I'm quite busy. Need something or can I get back to work?
Yeah? What do you want? If this is about the meadery, we can talk later.
Welcome! Allow me to recommend the Black-Briar Mead... the purest brew in all of Skyrim!
We serve only the best here... Black-Briar Mead. May I get one for you?
I'm off work at the Black-Briar Meadery. I'll be back there in the morning.
Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?
So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!
Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?
My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... [QUOTE]continue the Hlaalu tradition.[QUOTE] Bah! I left all that nonsense behind.
If Indaryn finds out, he'll have me thrown out of the Meadery for certain. So don't breathe a word of it to him. Not a word!
Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.
I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.
A Dreth never forgets a traitor. You'll pay for this!
Wilhelm was pleased with the delivery, well done.
I believe you have a delivery to make.
You look like you could use a drink. What do you say to some cheap mead?
I'm selling the best mead in town for cheap. Interested?
Well met. I don't think they're hiring anyone at the moment, so if you're looking for work, you're out of luck.
The trees... they're beautiful here. Reminds me of autumn at home.
The fall forest makes me miss my childhood; playing among the towering trees in Valenwood and living with my brethren.
Seeing the sorry state of this city almost makes me regret my decision to leave my home when my apprenticeship completed.
I was fortunate enough to be guided by one of Silvenar's master armorers until he passed.
On his deathbed, my master urged me to take over his business but I decided against it. I chose to wander Tamriel instead.
Now here I am, working for this dreary city's Fishery. I sometimes wonder why I don't just move on.
Hello. Welcome to the Pawned Prawn.
If there's anything you need, I'd be glad to help you.
My husband Bersi will be the death of me. He spends too much time worrying about Riften and not enough about himself.
All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him... and now that we hear rumors about the dragons, he's been very depressed.
Bersi's afraid that someone's making a move to take the Pawned Prawn from us. I think he's being paranoid.
We both own the Pawned Prawn together, but he's singlehandedly kept the place running despite all our problems.
I just care about my husband so much and I hate to see him in this state.
Welcome to the Pawned Prawn. What can I do for you?
I have all sorts of interesting items for sale. Have you looked around?
Pickings may be a bit slim today, but if you see anything you like I'll make you a good deal.
If you're looking for anything to sell for a fair price, I run the Pawned Prawn over by the market.
I presume you're bothering me for a good reason?
What in the name of Oblivion do you want?
I don't have time for idle chit-chat. What is it?
Fancy yourself the adventuring type, eh? It's just as well, I doubt your combat prowess would prove valuable in a real battle anyway.
I was trained by some of the finest warriors in all Skyrim to wield a blade as if it was an extension of my own arm.
My mother spares no expense where I'm concerned. I'm heir to the family fortune after all.
Once I'm in charge I have bigger aspirations than just Skyrim. I plan to bring Black-Briar Mead to all of Tamriel.
My children, Sibbi and Ingun, are being groomed to run the family business one day as well.
Sibbi will prove to be a fine leader one day, but Ingun... that girl has her mind somewhere other than business.
Maven's disappointed that Ingun's heart isn't in the family business, but she says [QUOTE]Ingun still has her uses.[QUOTE] Not sure what that means.
I'm Riften's appointed Steward. How can I help you?
Steward Hemming Black-Briar at your service.
Well, if it isn't my little problem-solver.
Well, well. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. I've always got time for lovely ladies.
Have you come to gawk at me or is this a social call?
Ah finally, someone besides the stupid guards to talk to.
As if daydreaming
Welcome back to the temple, messenger.
Blessings of Mara upon you!
How may I help you, my son?
How may I help you, my daughter?
Lady Mara's messenger returns. What can I help you with, my child?
Has the Warmth of Mara been given to Riften?
Lady Mara bids you welcome to Her Benevolence.
What is it you seek, my child?
Visiting Riften? All are welcome at the Temple of Mara.
Please to meet you, I'm a priestess at the Temple of Mara.
Thanks again for the delivery to Markarth. What can I do for you?
Did you get that purchase agreement to Markarth yet?
New in town, eh? Here for the fishing I'd guess.
There's nothing like fishing on Lake Honrich, you should try it sometime.
If you're hungry, Marise sells fresh fish... caught by yours truly.
If you're looking for a handout, you're not going to get one from me.
Can you believe my former husband used to give most of our gold to the poor?
If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband.
If you're looking for a handout, you'll want to speak with my husband. If you're looking for company, I suppose I could do worse.
Bolli's around somewhere, planning to feed the poor with his nonsense about Mara.
With my husband's new found religion, what I do with our coin and what I do all day seem less important to him. Suits me.
At this rate, he'll give the entire Riften Fishery away to charity. Then how will I live?
Such a waste of time preaching to the poor. If they're that hungry, they should just grow some food or something.
I spend every Friday at the fishery, so I know the meaning of hard work. All those forms to fill out and file; it's exhausting!
Mark my words. If Bolli thinks he's giving all of our wealth away to some poor slob, I'll leave him high and dry.
I'm feeling much better thanks to your efforts.
The pilgrimage is complete, I can feel it.
Anything else before you make the journey?
Come to laugh at the grave tender?
I can see that disapproving look in your eye.
Oh, it's you. Come to extort more from me?
New around Riften? Take my advice. Stay at the Bee and Barb... the Bunkhouse isn't for you.
If you're looking for a bed, this is the wrong place.
You looking for something or what?
Hey! Good to see you again.
Any luck getting the marks from those men?
Sorry about the mess. Keeping this place clean is quite a chore.
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your hands to yourself.
The Bunkhouse isn't an inn. I'd recommend the Bee and Barb.
Who did this to me?
This city is corrupt! You're all corrupt!
This is unfair! I'm innocent!
Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?
Have anything you wish to sell? I pay fair prices for all sorts of goods.
If there's anything you wish to purchase, just let me know.
If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands.
Working at the Riften Fishery is tough, but it puts some coin in my pocket.
I'm beginning to think leaving Mournhold was a mistake.
If Riften is the best Skyrim has to offer, I may as well turn back right now and just head for home.
Welcome to Riften, traveler. I hope the road fared well for you.
What can I do for you?
Speak, I wish to hear everything my subjects have to say.
I feel so helpless out here. The people of Riften depended on me, and I failed them.
Unmid and Anuriel shouldn't blame themselves for Riften's fall, I am the one who's ultimately responsible.
If Riften can be retaken, I will redouble my efforts to ensure the safety of my subjects and the defense of the Rift.
Out of my way. The son of the Jarl has no time for idle conversation with travelers.
If this isn't about official city business, you're wasting my time.
I presume you have something important to say?
Come to gloat, have we? To poke fun at the jarl's youngest son?
I can feel you laughing behind my back.
Did Harrald send you to taunt me?
Welcome to Mistveil Keep. I'm Jarl Laila's steward, Anuriel.
As Riften's Steward I'm afraid I can provide only limited assistance, but speak your mind.
If you're here to report any instances of corruption, be confident that we're handling these rumors accordingly.
I'm afraid my days as the steward of Riften has come to an end.
The Imperials now control Riften and have placed Maven Black-Briar on the Jarl's throne.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks might rally to take back Riften one day. Only time will tell.
As Jarl Laila's housecarl, I would ask that you maintain a respectable distance from her at all times.
Did you have some sort of official business here?
I'd request that when speaking to Jarl Laila, you show the proper respect.
Being in exile is the most humiliating thing I've experienced in my life.
I killed scores of the Empire's men before I was forced to surrender.
The only reason I stopped fighting was a plea from Laila, otherwise I'd would have fought to the death.
I know you. Where was it? Hm. Oh! You were getting something for me?
Did we have an appointment? No... it was a delivery? I can't remember.
Excuse my disorganization, but I'm in the middle of some delicate experiments.
Come to see Balimund perform miracles with steel, eh?
What brings you to Balimund today? Repair? Purchase?
Nothing like the smell of a white-hot blade, eh?
Looking for some armor? A weapon perhaps?
Here to purchase some armor or a weapon?
How can I help you today?
Have you met Balimund? I'm his apprentice. He's teaching me all about being a blacksmith.
I used to live at the orphanage here in Riften. Grelod said my ma and da left me there when I was a baby... that they didn't want me.
Balimund took me in and has been so kind to me. I don't know why, but he thinks I can be a great blacksmith like him.
At first I don't know why he picked me. I never even held a hammer in my life! But the first time I picked it up, it just felt right!
Folks in town say that Balimund is the greatest blacksmith in all of Tamriel. I hope I can live up to that some day and make him proud of me.
Welcome back! Good to see you again.
Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?
Oh, it's you. Not here to rob me are you?
Well met, friend. How can I help you?
You're a stranger here too, eh?
Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.
I've never seen Mjoll this upset about anything. The city really gets to her.
Mjoll told me that it isn't this bad everywhere. Maybe one day I'll venture out and see if she's right.
Mjoll's brought me nothing but safety and piece of mind... and some lessons with the blade.
I hope that someday this city will be free from corruption and we can all live in peace.
You here for lessons like Ingun? Or did you wish to buy something?
Do you have any idea how busy I am? My mixture could be burning as we speak!
Take a look at my supplies if you must, but do hurry... I'm not getting any younger you know!
Thanks again for delivering that ore sample.
Have you managed to make it out to Shor's Stone?
This place has seen better days, but it's not my fault.
Where's my head? I never even greeted you properly.
I apologize in advance for my husband's crankiness; I promise you he means well.
Please, please. I need but a septim. A septim is all I ask. Is that so bad?
I can't take this place anymore. The trees... all the colors, but the city, so dark. Why? It makes no sense.
So cold, so hungry, so tired.
No one cares about us! No one! We could die and no one would ever even know! They'd just throw our corpses in the canal!
Are you scared of death? I am. I hear everything just stops... forever. It just all goes away, but you don't realize it. I don't want to die.
Sure, sure. I'm a dirty beggar... why would you want to even speak to me.
To Oblivion with all of you! You rich piles of dung walking by us like we're not there! Pretending we don't exist! How dare you!
You think you know pain? Do you!? Try watching your wife and daughter burn alive after they've been ravaged by brigands! That's pain, my friend.
Edda... she's crazy as a loon, but at least she doesn't have the mind to realize what a horrible world this is. She's the lucky one.
Just leave Riften. Go far, far away and never return. This place is nothing but a rotten, stinking corpse that's sat in the sun far too long.
Greetings, honored friend. Could I interest you in some fine jewelry?
If anything pleases the eye, don't hesitate to make me an offer.
If you have any jewelry to sell, I'd be glad to pay you a fair sum in gold for it.
Come see me in the market if you're looking for the finest custom jewelry in all of Skyrim.
So, you're Brynjolf's new protege, eh? Don't look like much to me.
It's one thing to say you've got the skills to be a thief. It's another to actually use them.
It's been a long time since anyone joined us. Seems like people are in a rush to leave.
I hear even the simple jobs are becoming difficult. It never used to be like this.
Less coin in everyone's pocket means less coin in mine.
Something has to change soon or I may as well pack this place up and leave it for the skeevers.
You better have coin to pay for your drinks. There's no handouts here.
Got a lot of nerve coming down here. People tend to get hurt in the Ratway.
I wouldn't stay here long if I were you.
There's a reason the city guard doesn't come down here you know.
Don't make trouble or else I'll ask Dirge to [QUOTE]walk[QUOTE] you out.
Even if you're one of us, you better not make trouble.
I don't care if you're best buddies with the Guild Master. I'll still smash in your skull if you try anything.
The last person that made trouble for Vekel ended up floating in the canal... catch my drift?
Stay outta trouble, or there's gonna be trouble.
Last person who made trouble for Vekel ended up with a smashed head.
Vekel doesn't like strangers snooping around the Flagon.
There's two things to do at the Flagon: spend coin and then get out.
If it isn't the best brawler in Skyrim. Good to see you again!
You up for another wager?
Back, eh? Ready to brawl?
Too lazy to walk, eh? Well, you've found the right place.
Got horses that need shoeing, so make it quick.
If it's horses you want, you're talking to the right person.
If it's horses you want, I'm not sure I can help you. I have too much on my mind as it is.
If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir at the stables.
If it's horses you want, you'll want to speak to Hofgrir. I'm afraid I'm in too much trouble to help you.
Hofgrir is a great teacher. I've learned so much about horses from him.
Horses are all I know. I've been riding since I could walk.
If the forest wasn't so dangerous, I'd spend every spare moment riding.
When Aventus escaped, Grelod got meaner than ever. I really thought she was going to kill one of us. Guess not!
whispers frantically - pleading for help
I used to hate it here, but it's not so bad anymore. Constance is real good to us.
It's too bad the orphanage ain't letting us kids get adopted. I'd be the best son ever.
I was named after the sound a lion makes. You know: rrroooaaaarr! Really.
I can't believe it! Grelod is dead! She's really dead!
I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, Grelod has been so angry.
I do hope mummy and father come to get me soon. Ever since that Aventus boy left, this place has gone mad.
My parents dropped me off here a year ago. But they're coming back to get me. They said so.
You look kind of scary. But nobody is scarier than old Grelod.
Constance Michel says we have to be careful of people we don't know.
I'm really afraid of Grelod. When Aventus escaped, she was so mad. I got double the beatings that day.
Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities.
When Aventus escaped, Grelod was so mad. I got double the beatings that day. But that won't happen ever again.
I hate it here. Grelod the Kind is the meanest person in all of Skyrim.
Things are much better now that Grelod is dead, but still. I'm sick of this place.
Stretches out the [QUOTE]please[QUOTE] - like [QUOTE]pplleeeeaasssee[QUOTE] - pleading
When Aventus took off, when he said those things, about killing Grelod... I never imagined he was serious...
Come to get yourself a kid? You're out of luck. No way Grelod will let any of us get adopted. Especially not since Aventus took off.
Grelod ain't going to like some stranger just hangin' around. Not that I care.
Constance don't care much for strangers in the orphanage. Afraid someone might hurt one of us kids. Which, I gotta admit, is kind of nice.
Why's someone like you want to hang around a place like this?
Grelod... murdered. Here. I... I need... air... You... you... Get out of here! Get out!
I can't believe Grelod is dead. I had no love for the woman, but to be murdered, in cold blood...
You really shouldn't be in here.
I'm sorry, but the children aren't up for adoption right now. You should go.
My only concern is for the children. The poor darlings have no one else.
Welcome to the cozy little family. I'm one of the lookouts for the Guild. I watch Delvin's back.
If you're looking for extra work, talk to Vex or Delvin. They'll fix you up.
Stick to the rules and you'll end up rich. Break them and you're out on your arse. Simple, right?
If you're looking for conversation, The Flagon isn't the place.
Vekel and me, we have a thing going. So I recommend you keep your hands off the merchandise.
Vekel and me, we have a thing going. Try anything with him and it'd be bad for your health.
You don't impress me. So don't even try.
You going to buy something or just here for training? Otherwise, move on.
You gonna stare all day or buy some armor?
Come on, come on. The sooner you buy, the sooner I can get drunk.
Can't you bother me at my armor stand in the market? Or are you that desperate for training?
My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.
Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?
The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.
I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.
I'm feeling much better now thanks to you.
Did you bring anything? The pain...
Say as if with headache
I really need your help! I don't want to lose my job at the fishery! What am I going to do?
Headache
You have no idea what it's like to have everything, then watch it all disappear.
Let me out of here, damn it! I'm not a criminal!
This is what happens to you when you speak your mind in this city.
They threw me in here because I called Ulfric a liar; a deceiver.
Ulfric doesn't care about Talos. He yearns for the throne of Skyrim and he'll say anything to rally people to his side.
But now, because of Ulfric's greed, countless lives have been lost.
On second thought, maybe I'm better off in here. At least I'll die with a clear conscience.
Brynjolf sent you to rub it in?
Waste of talent throwing me in here, right?
Can't wait to get out of here.
What? What are you looking at?
Piss off. I'm busy.
Get away from me.
A pleasure, thane.
Is it daylight out? Night? I lose track down here.
The prisoners are in rare form, as usual.
Watch your step in here. The stonework gets slippery.
Now that the Empire's arrived in Riften, we've finally established a launching point into Morrowind... just in case.
So is it Riften or Rifton? This place has changed its name so many times, I can't even remember.
Seems like capturing Riften is turning out to be more of a hassle than a benefit. But what do I know?
Why we bothered to capture Riften I'll never understand. Just look at this place.
This city still reeks with the stench of the Stormcloaks. Makes me sick to my stomach.
I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane.
I trust the day's found you well, thane.
How do you do, thane?
You could say the Ratway is the city under the city. Dark, dangerous, and no place for decent folk.
Riften's under my protection. You watch yourself, now.
Careful. Riften's not the safest place for a nighttime stroll.
City's quiet enough now. But when the sun goes down, you best keep on your guard.
There's an apothecary in town, yeah. But it's down on the lower walkway, so stay sharp if you go down there.
There's fine steel at the Scorched Hammer, if you fancy a new blade.
Need a drink, you go to the Bee and Barb. Stay out of the Ragged Flagon, stay out of the Ratway.
If it's a bed you need, talk to Keerava in the Bee and Barb. She'll set you right.
There's a foul presence coming from Darklight Tower, southwest of the city. Some say the place is home to necromancers.
City got attacked once by those damn bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again.
Best not go wandering east of the city. Bandits been seen around Broken Helm Hollow.
Talk of strange happenings at Autumnshade Clearing, just north of the lake. My guess? Spriggans.
If you journey north, keep well away from Snapleg Cave. Damned Hagravens have infested the place.
By the gods, a dragon's been sighted just south of the city, flying around Lost Tongue Overlook.
Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me that demented little fool is up to something.
Of course nothing in here is stolen. Only a careless, shameful, idiotic fetcher would do something as stupid as to buy pilfered goods....
Oh by Azura, I've made a terrible mistake. I bought a gold ring, and Viola Giordano has been missing a ring that looks just like it.
It's not that easy. She'd go to the Jarl if she knew I was even remotely involved. You have to get it to her some other way.
Look, it's dangerous, but if you sneak the ring into her house. Put in a dresser or something. I will make it worth your while.
Thank you. Thank you! Azura's Prophecy always guide you to fortune.
Speaking of fortune. Here. Everything I earned from my last shipment. It's yours.
Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind.
I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them. That should teach those people a lesson.
You deserve something for sniffing out that thief. Here.
If you're one of the Jarl's men, you'll get your lumber. Anga's Mill pays its debts.
I'm a writer by trade. Not that the people of Skyrim do much reading.
Sorry, I thought Skald the Elder sent you. We've got an order to fill, and he's not known for patience.
Look, if you're heading towards Dawnstar anytime soon, can you give the Jarl this note? Let him know he'll get his lumber.
Falkreath is known for its graveyard, traveler. We've buried more dead than you can imagine.
I just finished giving my old war companion, Berit, a proper burial by fire. Old hard head hated the idea of being lost cold in the ground.
Could you deliver the ashes to Runil, the priest of Arkay? He'll know the right blessings to make for Berit's soul.
I write drama, friend. The legends and history of Skyrim made to excite and inspire.
Poor Giruad Gemane at the Bards College has been waiting for my latest work, [QUOTE]Olaf and the Dragon,[QUOTE] for weeks now. Roads are a mess.
My family has been doing it for years. You need one out in the Reach. Don't want to be alone when some Forsworn comes swinging.
I personally trained a whole litter for the Jarl. That reminds me, I was going to deliver some dog food to the Keep. Spiced beef. Their favorite.
This mine is only a few years old, but I've been digging up ore for over a century.
We're getting to the point where the tunnels are getting deep into the rock. People complain of bad coughs and foul air.
I've seen this before. We need some medicines to combat the ore dust. I was about to send a message to Windhelm for aid.
My brother is... sensitive. He has trouble focusing his attention on things.
We were taking him to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun, just so the healers could make sure he was in good health, and they say he's fine.
Are you heading to Whiterun? Could you take this letter to the priestess, Danica Pure-Spring? It's a note about Joric's health.
You're sure? When you see Giruad, ask for a tip. I'm sure he'll be in a good mood after reading this.
Well, look at you, thanks. Take it to Voada, she handles all the dogs for the Jarl.
Thank you. Take it to Quintus, in the White Phial.
Indeed it is.
Typical.
We'll get by.
What's this? Oh, that's right, the timbers from Anga's Mill.
I swear, that Aeri and her men would make fine Stormcloak recruits. Pity we can't spare the lumber to conscript them.
Here. Take this. For your time and all that.
Oh, thank you. The dogs were getting restless.
Ah, Berit's ashes. He was a good man. Not many warriors grow to a fine, old age.
Thank you for bringing this to me. I'll make sure he gets his rites. Here, for your trouble.
Ah yes, Adonato's new work. Shorter than I expected, but words must be judged on merit, not length.
I'll look over this later. Why don't you take this, for your trouble?
Oh dear. Darkwater Crossing needs medicines for its miners?
I'll see about getting this order filled right away. Here, a few septims for you.
Joric's sister? Poor child. Magic runs deep in that family's bloodline. It's not always a blessing.
Thank you for this. Something for your trouble.
So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous.
You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.
Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go! Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.
Whistling - no subtitles
You must speak with Astrid. Here, in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary.
Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, he's in there!
Hurry, Nazir! I'm telling you, she's in there!
grunts as if pulling something heavy
I'm not exactly built for manual labor. Now come on, you've almost got it.
One more... pull...
Yeeaahh! There.
Can you get it open?
I think so. Just hold on a moment.
We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.
Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location... we have no idea what we're going to find.
And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence.
What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?
Try casting a spell at the wall. See what happens!
There must be something about that amulet. Have you tried putting it on?
Looks like the boss is at it again.
Why? What's he doing now?
He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole.
We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him.
Someone should let that cat lose.  That'd shut him up real quick.
Don't say that to loud, you don't want it getting back to him.
Forgive me. I was... intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty.
The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.
I have given my answer. Go and reconsider your course.
So the Blades have survived yet another disaster of their own making, and continue to meddle in things they do not understand.
with grudging respect
Go away! Leave me alone!
That's all, hmm?
Goodbye then.

Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow.

Ooh, cocky.
I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat.
smiling as he says it
Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm?
That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed.
True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues.
emphasis on HOW he was defeatedVahrukt unslaad = memory unceasing
revak strunmah = sacred mountain
Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.

Tiid krent. Time was... shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin.
If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll back here... to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound...
With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to... cast yourself back. To the other end of the break.
You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.

I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the... sundering of Time itself.

You are likely better informed than I.

Watch it!
Ouch! Hey!
What the?
Whoops.
Mind yourself.
What's the hurry?
Excuse me.
Uh, sorry.
Mind the way.
Perhaps not. But this Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again.
Not hate. Distrust and fear. The Blades have always sought to turn the Dragonborn away from the path of wisdom.
That may be what you are here for, Dragonborn.
But stopping Alduin is one thing. Helping you wipe out dragons again is quite another.
Dragons are part of the natural order of the world. The Blades thought to change the order to suit themselves, by wiping out the dragons.
But again, we see that the natural order will be restored, one way or another.
Perhaps we would have dragon allies against Alduin if the ancient Blades had not acted so arrogantly.
The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?
The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds.
Tell me. Why do you come here, volaan? Why do you intrude on my meditation?
The Blades were born of dragon-hating crusaders. They still carry that legacy although they may not remember from whence it came.
They carried out a genocide of dragons when they first came to Tamriel, and now they will do it again, with your help.
It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult.
Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout.
When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout.
In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself.
Your kind - joorre - mortals - created it as a weapon against the dov... the dragons.
struggling with expressing this in Englishhaddrimme = minds
Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way.
If you wish to stand alone, so be it. If you wish for our help, you'll answer my question.
They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom.
Have you learned nothing from us? Would you simply be a tool in the hands of the Blades, to be used for their own purposes?
Do not be so sure about that. Beware - the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.
As for me, I kept from you only what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals.
Keep moving, stay focused on your goal, and you will reach the summit.
So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood.
What would you ask of me?
zin = honor, heyv = duty
Wunduniik = traveller
strunmah = mountain
You are bold, wunduniik. You dare enter a Dovah's home without permission.
I am as my father Akatosh made me. As are you... Dovahkiin.
modestly - maybe a bit of false modestywuth = old, onik = wise
vahzah = true, tinvaak = speak/talk
It has been long since I held tinvaak with a stranger. I gave in to the temptation to prolong our speech.
Drem. Patience. There are formalities which must be observed, at the first meeting of two of the dov.
Point that somewhere else!
Don't do that, it's mean!
You have a death wish?
Careful there!
That's a dangerous game you're playing.
Woah... watch it!
I suggest you aim elsewhere.
Please! Don't shoot!
Hmm? What're you doing?
Now that's just rude.
You're not going to shoot, right?
There's no need for that.
Don't be a fool.
I'll let you live. This time.
I'll spare you - for now.
All right, you've had enough.
You're not worth it.
I didn't think you had the stomach for it.
The door up ahead will be locked. Klotha, one of the hagravens, will have the key on her.
Watch out for pressure plates here.
Listener. I am your only salvation. Come. Embrace me.
This is Markarth, traveler. Safest city in the Reach.
You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?
Whole dwarven city underneath the keep. Nchuand-Zel. Best steer clear if you don't want a Steam Centurion carving you up.
By the Hist, if I don't get something soon, I don't know how I'll get through the week.
No. I'm not. I feel like my scales are clawing into me. Maybe you could help an old Argonian out?
I heard some of the sailors talking about how they stashed a bottle of Double-Distilled Skooma in the Gnisis Cornerclub. I just need a taste.
Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way. The Jarl is convinced I have some connection with the College, so he goes easy on me.
Maybe you'd like to help me keep up appearances? Old Nelacar has a mage's staff in his room in the Frozen Hearth.
It'd be good to have that staff in case the Jarl starts wondering if I actually have a real connection to the College.
Not against me. Against all of Falkreath. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.
Last night I saw Lod the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to Solitude and General Tullius.
Are you loyal to Skyrim? Break into Lod's house and get that letter.
Thank you. I'll be waiting for that bottle.
Thanks. I'll be waiting for it.
Hist spit on you.
Daedra take you, then.
Thank you so much. Here. Let me show you a thing or two about not attracting attention to yourself.
This should come in handy. Here. Let me show you a few tricks I've learned about buttering up royalty.
reading a letter
He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them.
Good work. Take this.
How's business today?
Well enough, I suppose. Nilsine bought up most of the tomatoes, and was asking if we could get more.
We've got another dozen ripening on the vine. They should be ready in a few days.
I'll be sure to tell her.
Did you have any luck tracking own some more pitchforks?
Revyn put the word out to his suppliers but with the war on, tools are scarce. Both sides have been snapping them up.
Tell him I'll pay double the normal price. We've been getting by with one broken pitchfork, but it's falling apart.
I'll be sure to stress your urgency. It seems like every farmer in Skyrim is short on supplies these days.
Hello, Jora. I'm glad to see you. In fact, I was just thinking about you and your husband.
Mildly suspicious.
Well, I've heard awful stories about these Thalmor, and how they're rounding up everyone who still worships Talos.
The interrogations are quite merciless, from what I've heard.
I fear for you and your husband, should the Thamlor come here. But perhaps there's a way I can help.
I doubt Ulfric would let Thalmor into Windhelm without a fight. But please, do continue. How would you help us?
Sly, as if sharing a secret.
They are discreet and thorough, though not inexpensive. I hope you'll keep that in mind, should the worst come to pass.
We accept the risks that come with our faith, but I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you, Niranye.
I wanted to thank you again for the mince pie you sent over. It was delicious.
It was my pleasure, Torbjorn. I enjoy cooking, and after what you and Tova have been through, it was the least I could do.
My little Friga loved to cook, but she was terrible at it. Then one day, out of nowhere, she made the most amazing leek soup.

One should never pay too much attention to rumors, Torbjorn.
Equal parts amused and smug. This is a women who thinks she is in control, and has fear of her interrogator.
It's a bad time to be a criminal, what with these murders going on.
This is a man speaking to a suspected head of a thieves' guild, and the words imply a threat. He is basically saying [QUOTE]I'd watch my ass if I were you.
Cool, calculated and a bit amused. This speaker has just been accused of being the head of a thieves' guild - which she is - but she won't admit it.
The eyes of the law are everywhere these days.
Said with a hint of threat, since the speaker suspects that the woman he's talking to is a criminal.
I understand you purchase used goods, as well as sell them?
Yes, that's right. Whether or not I'm interested depends on what you've got, of course.
Some rief creeps into her voice toward the end. Friga was murdered recently.
Said with concern and pity. He's a junk dealer and he's talking to a woman who wants to sell him her daughter's things, as her daughter was murdered
Friendly, but in an artificial, almost forced way. She is buttering the target up. Maybe even a bit flirty. Actor's discretion =)
In fact, I'm glad you're here. There's something I'd like to ask you.
A pleasure to see you as well, Niranye. What can I do for you?
I was wondering if you still had many associates in the shipping profession.
I have a business proposition for any sailors who might be looking to make a few extra septims.
If that business proposition includes smuggling, forget it.
The speaker is telling someone off, and rebuffing a business proposition. This should have a slightly scolding tone.
Mock regret, with a bit of flirting thrown in.
Is that new batch of tomatoes ready for sale yet, Hillevi?
You know, I'm not sure. My husband's been tending to the vines, so I'll have to ask him.
Just promise me when you get some more in, I'll have the first crack at them.

Friend Brunwulf, how good to see you!
If you see anything you like, just let me know and I'll glad offer you a discount.
That's not necessary. I'll pay the same price as anyone else.
But I insist. and with good reason.
Malthyr told me that you've been speaking to Ulfric about our situation. He said you're going to help us.
So few Nords have ever offered to help us, a discount is the least I can do.
Stern and a little annoyed.
Crestfallen.
Crestfallen and sad.
Why are you here? Get away from me!
By the gods! Somebody help me!
Please, just... just leave me be!
I'm really not in the mood. State your business, or take your leave.
I'm busy, and you're bothering me. So go away.
You fighter types are always underfoot. You want me to clean? Then scat!
cranky
You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?
I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.
Hrm. You go find your own wreck. This one's mine.
Go away! This is my wreck! Mine!
Yes, yes. What is it? We're all very busy here...
By the love of the Nine, what is it with you sycophants and hangers on? The jarl is busy! And so am I, for that matter.
What next, giant snakes?
I hate those damn things. Too many eyes, you know?
extremely tired, blocking with a shield
Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?
You really don't want to be loitering here, stranger.

And how may Ma'randru-jo assist you, hmm?
Purchase something or leave. Those are your options.
Let me guess - you have some [QUOTE]business[QUOTE] to discuss...
You do realize there's only one way this can end.
Thank you so much for taking care of those thieves. The Riverwood Trader is back to the way it used to be!
Thanks for bringing the claw back.
It means so much to us to have the claw back where it belongs. Thank you!
Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?
Sorry Mercer, they no longer wish to be involved in our operation.
I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?
I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.
Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame...
Maven has been nagging us about her request. Any thoughts?
Do we have anyone reliable to send out there? I don't want to look the fool again in front of her, Brynjolf.
Yes, I know. That last job was my fault. I obviously thought Niruin was ready, but I was wrong.
Remind me why we even bother to allow him to be a part of the Guild.
Two reasons. He's rich and because we need every sword we can get right now.
I think we need to prepare for the worst. The coffers are dwindling and I can barely keep our contacts happy.
There's no need to be concerned. We've been through more difficult times than this.
Normally I'd agree, but we've already lost so many contacts across Skyrim. If we lose the ones in Riften, we may as well close up shop.
I'll speak to the Jarl and see what I can do. Just keep them at bay a little longer.
Delvin, please tell me you have good news.
If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bite in weeks. Our clients are starting to get angry.
You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!
I will, I will...
So, Thrynn, you were a bandit, huh?
Yeah, what of it?
snicker at the end
You're an idiot.
So, what do you think, my dear? Could a beautiful woman like you ever see yourself with an old codger like me?
Oh, really? Well then... how can I make that happen?
When you're in your grave and I'm standing over it. Now get out of my way!
Delvin, that last shipment we heisted on the Cyrodiil frontier was worthless!
That's impossible. I distinctly heard that lout in the tavern say it was a full shipment of furs. They should be worth a fortune.
You idiot. He said [QUOTE]firs[QUOTE] not [QUOTE]furs.[QUOTE] It was a damn logging caravan!
Oh my... umm, you won't let Mercer hear about this will you? Ahem.
I've picked up some new clients and did a few jobs on my own, but I'm not sure if that will cover our expenses.
Thank you, Vex. You've always been the most reliable one in the Guild.
Well, what the hell is Mercer going to do about this mess? Have you even talked to him?
Mercer is being Mercer. If he has a plan to get us out of this rut, then he isn't sharing it with me.
How are you feeling, Vex?
Pretty angry actually. I can't believe I botched the Goldenglow job. That should have been like stealing a sweetroll from a baby.
Well, I see your wounds have healed but your pride still needs some time.
Brynjolf, something stinks around here and it's more than just the Ratway. We all know it. The question is, what's Mercer going to do about it?
Hold a moment, Rune. What did you think about my idea?
Your idea to start a brothel, right? Do you want me to tell you exactly what I think?
Well, yes! Please!
I think if Brynjolf catches wind of it, he'll boot you right out of here... so drop it already!
What in the name of Oblivion is going on in this place?
Yeah, I know what you mean. If things don't start getting better soon, I may look for work elsewhere.
Hey, I still have a contact in Valenwood that may have some work for us. You're welcome to join me.
I'll keep that in mind.
I tried to fence some goods to Tonilia, and you know what she told me?
I think I know, but go ahead.
She said that she barely had enough coin to cover it and I should come back later. Can you imagine that?
This place is getting worse and worse.
Vipir [QUOTE]the Fleet.[QUOTE] The only man who's foolish enough to name himself after his bedroom prowess.
You stupid cow. You don't know what you're missing.
No, but I know that you're going to turn up missing if you keep up this kind of talk.
You seem to be a bit closer to Brynjolf than the rest of us. Is he giving you any idea why this place seems to be falling apart?
If he does, he isn't telling me a thing. I've asked, but all I get from him are more questions.
What about Mercer? Have you asked him?
No, and I'm not about to either. I value my life you know... you may want to remember that for yourself.
All right. I have everything you asked for all ready to go.
I hope this deal goes through. I'm putting quite a bit of coin on the line... and the last two you set up fell through.
I don't understand it either. They were a sure thing, I swear.
You just better hope this one isn't another waste of my coin.
So, the ending of my tale I began earlier...
Is this your tale of single-handedly fighting off a pack of trolls or my favorite... where you bedded four women on the same night?
Well, if you don't want to hear it, that's your loss.
If I wanted to hear a tall tale, I'll read a children's storybook. Get some better stories, Vipir.
No! Don't leave me here! I beg you to let me out!
Please! I'll pay you. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't leave me here!
Hurry! Get me out of here!
Use the key to open the door! We have to be quick!
Not now! It's time to get back at these crows.
I'm glad they didn't find my lucky dagger. It's time to gut these rotten birds. Lead the way!
Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll take everything you have... or your life.
Actually... on second thought, I'll just kill you!
Yours was not an easy transformation. But you're still alive, so congratulations.
We even have a celebration planned for you.
The bastards... somehow they managed to kill Skjor.

Please, you can't leave me in here! If you let me out I can show you where they hide their best treasure.
My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar.
You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders.
over-confidant
Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.
I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod.
Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine.

Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us.
I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed.
What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?
When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill.
Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again.
Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over.
You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?
Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war.
I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final.
Brings back memories. Do you have any orders for me, Legate?
Keep the guard alert. I want to make sure no townspeople get hurt if there's trouble.
Yes, Legate. No one is getting through us.
Shor's bones, I hope you're right.
self-deprecating, joking
flustered
Oh, don't be such an old stick, Horik. I was joking. I can do that, you know. Redo the battle plans. I'll look over them later.
Yes, Legate.
I want you to know I don't trust you, Madena. And I'll be watching you.
I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald. I'm here to help the people of Dawnstar, not play politics. Point your suspicions of treachery elsewhere.
So you say. We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move.
Well, at the first sign of battle I'll be comfortably sitting in my room, waiting for it to end, so don't you worry.
doesn't want to be bothered
sincere, unintentionally insulting
I said I'm fine, Madena. I won't have some court mage fixing me up like some magical experiment.

Madena, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Your magic would be invaluable.

Well, it's a winding road up the mountain just ahead. You'll know you're in the right place once you spot the old watchtower.
Once you get to the tower, head north. Bleak Falls Barrow should be just around the corner further up.
Is he? You've saved him?! I must see him at once!
What? After all this, I can't even see him?
How... How do I know you're telling me the truth, and not just what I want to hear?
[QUOTE]...for it bears aloft next summer's seeds.[QUOTE] That's my boy.
So it's true, then. For now, it's enough to know that he's alive. I can find peace in that.
Thank you, dear friend. You've given me back my son.
I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now.
Why don't you take it? We can always make another for the day when this war ends and Thorald can come home.
With Eorlund gone, I'm afraid I can't offer you much in the way of thanks. But please, take this. It's the least I can do.
Sorry, lass... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.
Sorry, lad... I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time.

I'm busy right now, lad. We can talk later.
Always a pleasure, boss. What can I do for you?
Pull up a seat and have a drink.
Something troublin' ya? I'll listen.
So, what can I do for ya today?
Still have quite a good bit of jobs available if you're looking for some extra coin.
Need some gold? I may have some work for you.
Got lots of jobs available. Interested?
So, you're the one Brynjolf's been jabberin' about. Been waitin' to have a word with you.
I think you better listen to Mercer and Brynjolf first. We can talk later.
Talk to me again if you prove yourself to Brynjolf.
Come back later and I may have some work for you.
I think Brynjolf can give you all the information you need.
Disinterested, relaxed
I'm listenin'.
Looking to fix your armor?
Can I interest you in anything? Some fine armor perhaps?
Be glad to repair any damage to your Guild armor.
Making a bad joke.
Need some sort of toxin for a special occasion? That's where I come in.
I sell all sorts of poisons for almost every occasion.
Looking for the best smith in Skyrim? You found it.
They don't call me the Ember-Master for nothing. What do you need?
Need your weapon repaired? Or could I interest you in a new one?
I've got all sorts of weapons for the discerning marksman. What can I get you?
If you're in the market for the finest bows money can buy, you're talking to the right person.
Skilled, lethal and good-looking. Yep, it's a curse.
Hey, let's talk a second.
You're making waves around here. I like that. If you ever want to talk about anything, you let me know.
Hey, how's it going. Need pickpocket training?
If you need pickpocket training, just let me know.
If you want to be a master pickpocket like me, I can get you there.
If you wondering why they call me Vipir the Fleet, watch me outrun the town guard sometime.
I've been a part of this Guild for as long as Mercer has been Guild Master.
I might not be as big as some of my fellow Nords, but in a fight they can barely lay a hand on me.
My specialty is pickpocketing. All I need is a rich mark, a moon-lit sky and I'm in my element.
I wouldn't mind teaching the ways of the pickpocket... if the gold was right.
I miss the glory days of this place. We had more coin stacked in the vaults than we even knew what to do with.
Come here a second.
A lot of people are beginning to get impressed with you here. Me included. Just wanted to let you know.
Interest you in some marksman training?
If you need marksman training, and you've got the coin... I'm ready to teach you.
What's on your mind?
Of course you can buy me a drink... you didn't need to say a word, but I heard you loud and clear.
Ugh. The wine in Skyrim tastes like urine compared to the fine vintages we had in Valenwood.
I don't miss home one bit. I'm glad to leave that life behind me.
I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father.
It's not hard to fit in and make friends when you have the coin to make it happen.
I don't bother with silly pickpocketing jobs when I can make far more at the gambling table.
Let's talk for moment.
Look, if I was a little harsh before, I just wanted you to know it's because you were new. Know what I mean?
Well, hey there. What can Sapphire do for you?
Back from a job, huh? Hope it went well.
Want to talk? Go ahead.
They call me Sapphire because I love to steal them.
Don't get me wrong, I'll steal any gem that isn't nailed down. But there's something about those blue stones that gets my blood boiling.
When people ask my real name, know what I tell them? Don't ask.
Sure I might have some dirt in my past, but that's just ancient history.
I'm a deadeye marksman, lethal with a blade and dangerous in bed. And it only gets better from there.
Last time someone cheated me, I cut off their hand. Still have it actually.
Wanted to say something to you.
I think you're all right. In fact, I'm kind of impressed how well you're doing around here. Just keep it between us, okay?
Yeah, you need something?
like an informal greeting
Sure, we can talk a minute.
I've seen a lot of thieves come and go, but I've never seen anyone as good as me.
I could crack the lock on any house blindfolded before you even got your picks out of your pocket.
Been in the Guild a long time... joined right after Brynjolf. Not interested in leadership though, that's more his kind of thing.
I don't care if Vex was chosen as a Guild Third over me, she deserved it.
I kind of like watching things from where I am. Making money is all I care about.
Hey, I want to talk to you... now.
You're pretty tough, I respect that. Bringing in a lot of coin for the Guild, making us look good too. Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Need something?
You want to talk to me? Okay.
Yeah, I guess I have a minute. What do you want?
I'm the heavy hitter around here. When someone needs pushing around, I'm the one they send in.
Used to run with a bandit clan in The Pale. Turns out I didn't like them and they didn't like me, so we parted ways.
Brynjolf pulled me in a few years ago. Said the Guild was lacking some muscle, so I joined up.
I've busted heads for Maven Black-Briar when she wants to keep her name out of it. Pays good, so why not?
I leave all that sneaking around nonsense to everyone else; believe me, when I'm coming for you... you'll know it.
Got a minute? Wanted to say something.
I've never seen anyone with skills like yours. I just wanted to let you know that if you need anything, you can talk to me.
Hey, good to see you!
Something I can help with or do you just want to talk?
My brother in crime... what'd you need?
My sister in crime. What'd you need?
Name's Rune. Yeah, rune... just like you're thinking.
Have no idea what my birth name really is, and I frankly don't care.
Being brought up by a poor family, I had to learn how to steal if I wanted to make ends meet.
Brynjolf actually caught me trying to pick his pocket in the market. If he was anyone else I would have gotten away with it.
I'm glad Brynjolf decided to let me join. Been trying to make some coin for him ever since.
Hmph, so you're the one everyone's falling over.
I don't know, you don't look so impressive to me. I mean, you're no Gray Fox, but you must be doing something right.
I'm busy, is this important?
Are you bothering me for a reason?
We haven't met.
Name's Garthar. Remember it, because you're going to hear a lot about me.
Still learning the ropes, but I'll get the hang of it.
Been doing a few jobs for Vex... how about you?
Did you want something?
Our Guild Master graces me with a visit. What can I do for you?
Steal anything worth talking about?
Back with good news I trust.
Well? You done or what?
Out with it. Time is money.
So, feeling loose? How about you run a job for me.
Need a few spare septims? I got the cure right here.
I have work if you've got the backbone.
Ready for some work or you just going to wander around all day?
So, you're the new recruit everyone's been talking about, eh? I guess it's about time we talked.
After you talk to Brynjolf and Mercer, come back and see me.
I have no business with you.
I'm busy. Don't you have something to do?
I'm not here to hold your hand. Figure this one out for yourself.
You need advice? Talk to Brynjolf... I got better things to do.
Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.
Don't you have better things to do than disturb me?
This better be important, I'm quite busy.

The forge is hot today.
Not hot enough. Does your Skyrim ever get warm, husband?
Hammerfell? I'm not against the idea, but why?
I'm just worried about raising a child in the middle of this war of yours.
War of mine? It's not my war, Seren!
Your people's war, I mean. The Nords. What kind of life would we be giving our little one if we stayed here?
I... well, let me think about it.
Keep at it. We need to work twice as hard now that fat-headed Leigelf has declared war!
We're at war with Leigelf? Isn't he your husband?
No he isn't! He's the enemy, and we are going to crush him.
Drafted into a war, how could my life get worse?
Work hard, now! The pride of Iron-Breaker Mine is on the line.
Pride of the what? This isn't the Legion, boss. We're miners, not soldiers.
You'll shut your mouth and get back to work, or you won't be a miner or a soldier by the day's end. Hear me?
Uh, yes ma'am.

If you don't mind me saying, Leigelf. You're working too hard. Go home.
Never. Not until we turn this mine around, drive Beitild out of business, and force her to apologize to me for everything she's done!
What is this feud you have with your wife? What started this?
I don't want to talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it, or you don't know?
worried about people's safety
If we win. This war is going to drag on for years. I can feel it. We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead.
Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.
The path to Paarthurnax lies through this gate. I will show you how to open the way.
You made it!
We need to get inside. Follow me!
Come on! We need to get inside before that dragon comes back!

Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.
Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers.
We're not leaving here until we get what we came for.

That's the spirit. Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated.
Amusing.
She was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair.
She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.
All that talent will go to waste when I'm finished with her.
Mother thought I should be taught a lesson for airing the family's dirty laundry in public.
I mean, I've... taken care of many people for her in the past. What in Oblivion did she expect me to do?
Ah well. At least I have all the comforts of home during my stay. Well, except the touch of a woman of course.
I've been hurt worse before.
Please, I beg you, don't tell Sibbi where I am. He'll kill me!
Sibbi's been spreading lies about me, you must hear me out.
Well, that's just about the best news I've heard all week.
I was going to give this to whomever killed her for me, but I suppose you've earned it by bringing me this information.
This key opens one of my drop spots in the basement of the meadery. Take anything inside you like.
Cut out the middleman, eh? Shrewd, very shrewd. You sure you don't have some Black-Briar blood in you?
You idiot. You came all the way down here for that?
You've done me a great service, my friend. Allow me to compensate you for the information.
This key opens one of my stashes in the basement of the meadery. Help yourself to any of its contents.
I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes. However, the road ahead is paved with loose cobbles and deadly pitfalls.
Master Elgrim says I'm a natural; that I have a unique talent. But I fear his approval masks his intolerance for my mistakes.
My errant formulas have cost Master Elgrim a fortune in ingredients; some of which are almost irreplaceable.
To restore Master Elgrim's supply I would need 20 deathbell, 20 nightshade and 20 nirnroot.
Am I sensing that you may be interested in gathering these rare ingredients for me?
That means more time for my experiments and less time in the field. Much appreciated.
It's exhilarating to observe the effects of my potions on the body. Watching the heart stop... the eyes go blind.
We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of different functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.
Yet if only a single part of our imperfect machine fails, life fails. It makes one realize how fragile... how flawed we are.
You ask why I'm so fascinated? The irony... the irony that the same world that gave us life provides us the means to die.
Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.
Nightshade is native to the pine forest and marshy tundra regions of Skyrim and has a distinctive starburst-like violet flower.
Last we have deathbell which only grows in marshy tundra terrain. Its inverted bluish-purple flower bunches are unmistakable.
Yes, Master Elgrim will be pleased I've restored his stock of these rare ingredients.
I feel I owe a bit more than some meaningless coin for all your diligence. Here, this key unlocks my supply chest at Elgrim's Elixirs.
Feel free to take what you need from time to time. I'll be refilling it once every few days or so.
Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with.
shaking his head sadly
Halt! You have no business here, outsider. Leave at once.
Ugor, no! This may be the one we need.
We need nothing from outsiders! Yamarz will provide for us.
We cannot carry on this way! You know we are doomed if we do not do something!
Yamarz charged me with keeping outsiders away from Largashbur. You would have me disobey him?
You were charged with keeping us inside the walls. Have faith, Ugor. I only wish the best for our tribe.
Fine, it's your neck.
Forgive Ugor's harsh words. She is merely doing as she has been told.
You have returned. Will you now aid me in contacting Malacath?
Our chief is weakened. He will not rest, will not sleep. He suffers, and so the tribe suffers.
Yamarz is proud, and refuses to see that we need outside help.
He needs someone to confide in. If it will not be one of us, perhaps it will be you. Go to him.
Atub! Meddlesome woman... You would help us? Help me?
Tell me, outsider. Can you banish spirits? For that is what I need.
Spirits! Ghosts! I am cursed, haunted, and I can do nothing. Can you fix that?
Of course you cannot. No one can. It is my lot as Chief of this tribe, and so I suffer quietly.
The kind that curse you, haunt you in the dead of night. There is nothing you can do, nothing anyone can do.
Shagrol, once the leader of this tribe, unhappy with his demise, has dealt with Malacath himself to curse me, curse us all.
You? An outsider? I'd sooner slit my own throat than accept help from you.
To even consider it would be such a sign of weakness that I might as well abandon my tribe now.
So, he says to petition Malacath for relief? Interesting.
Perhaps. But he spoke of this [QUOTE]curse[QUOTE] to you, which means it has deeply affected him.
It may be worth attempting contact with Malacath after all.
Go to Malacath's shrine, southeast of Largashbur. See if perhaps he will aid us after all.
Yes, but he offered it as an idea. Perhaps he hopes it will be helpful, but does not wish to risk personal failure.
You should do as he says. Go to Malacath's shrine, northwest of here, and ask for his help. See what happens.
His shrine lies northwest of Largashbur. I am unsure that he will listen, but it cannot hurt.
The ears of the wind?
Malacath himself said this to you? But what does it... Ah! Yes! I see! A ritual is necessary!
This message is for me. I understand now. I have work to do. You, I shall need your help.
I need a Daedra's heart, at once! Quickly, quickly!
What?! No, that's not me. I'm not Esbern. I don't know what you're talking about.
Go away!
I told you to go away. I'm not opening this door for anybody!
surprised, then bitter and suspicious
Oh, how reassuring! Most likely you're with the Thalmor and this is just a trick to get me to open the door!
I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar.
But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.
Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal.
But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries.
By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.
Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior.
Is there... something else you need?
Yes, um.... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually.
I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries.
Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own.
I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the most important work your organization has had in, well... centuries.
Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else.
So I'll cut right to the chase.
As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied.
I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable.
But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target.
The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of...
...the Emperor.
Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.
So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned.
But I digress. Here, take these to your, um... superior.
claps twice before saying [QUOTE]the items,[QUOTE] as if he's summoning a servant
That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No?
You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned.
But I digress. Here, take these. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior.
It's a shocking request, I know. But it is inside the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed?
You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now you're here, as if the very stars have finally aligned.
But I digress. Here, let me give you these. They are to be delivered to your, um... superior.
angry at being questioned
But what I ask of you... it must be done. There is too much at stake.
I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion.
Is this no longer so?
In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin.
His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy.
There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say.
Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold... a fortune in gold. But so much more!
It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent years, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so?
If you do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and respect you.
The logistics of such an endeavor will be staggering, I know. There will be several minor assassinations necessary. Leading up to the... main target.
As I mentioned, the amulet I gave you is exceptionally valuable, and will certainly cover the costs of all these other unpleasantries.
The sealed letter explains everything else, in detail. It should be delivered to your superior. Whomever that may be.
You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?
You're joking.
By Sithis, you're not joking.
To kill the Emperor of Tamriel... The Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius.
As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago...
No, she certainly wouldn't. And... for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you.
I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some fluke, or what. But what we now have before us...
Laughs with a single [QUOTE]ha![QUOTE] at the beginning. Like, [QUOTE]Our you kidding??[QUOTE]
You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory?
But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm...
I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it.
And, there's only one man who can give us what we need - Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften.
Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit - that's fine.
Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have... history. He can be trusted.
Dangerous-looking elves who didn't give their names. Draw your own conclusions.
Various shady types I've never seen before. I'd watch my back if I was you.
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Hardly ever leaves the place - has someone bring him food and such.
Crazy old coot, from what I've heard. For that to stand out down here, he must really be off his nut.
He lives somewhere in the Ratway Warrens. Must be crazy or desperate to live down there. Maybe both.

Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us during the Great War.
He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades.
ruefully
Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side...
Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does.
Do they know where he is?
You'd better get to Riften. Ask around the Ragged Flagon, in the Ratway. It's at least a good starting point.
You'd better get to Riften. Talk to Brynjolf. He's... well-connected. A good starting point at least.
Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm stuck down here.
Is anyone out there? Anyone?
You, you there! Help me, I'm trapped.
Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan.
The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child...
What about you? Have you... have you spoken to anyone? No.... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying!
And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys!
You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you...
...sweet Night Mother.
Finally, you're back.
blood-thirsty
Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.
Lot of people looking for him. Don't know his name, but he's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here.
Well... there is guy like that. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.
He's holed up in the Ratway Warrens. Be careful. You're not the only one looking for him.
Huh. Lot of old guys around. I don't really know how I can help.
Don't know his name, but there is a guy like that hiding out down here. Paid plenty for nobody to know about it.
You're not the first person to come in here asking about him, either, so be careful.
Yeah, I think I know who you mean. He's paid good money for nobody to know he's down here, but I guess I can tell you.
Down in the Ratway Warrens. Nice place, if you don't mind the stench, rats, and assorted lowlifes as neighbors.
That's interesting. Why do I care? You want a drink, or maybe just a few broken bones?
Never heard of anybody like that. But if you want to hide out in Riften, the Ratway's where you'd be.
There's a sort of tavern down there, the Ragged Flagon. Where all the lowlifes in Riften get drunk and knife each other.
You might try there, if you can get through the Ratway alive.
My husband Leigelf is dead. I... I never thought I would miss that oaf so much.
Iron-Breaker Mine is three times the worth of that Quicksilver Mine and its fat-head owner.
My miners are as dumb as rocks are grey.
The Mortar and Pestle has cures for every illness, from Ataxia to Witbane.
A Stamina Potion maybe? Popular with young men.
Frost took my husband years ago. He was a good man.
My children all grew up and left Dawnstar to make their fortune.
I will serve Dawnstar as I always have.
You should see the grin on Horik's face now that we're in charge. I know he hides it, but I can tell.
The Jarl and I have our disagreements. Sorry if you had to overhear one of them.
I wasn't born in Skyrim, but when I served in the Legion this land became my home.
Horik and I have lived here ever since I retired. He's a good soldier.

You looking for a shield? Best thing between you and the enemy, friend.
Don't forget getting a good pair of gauntlets. Broken hands can't hold a sword.
I hear people were spotted using the Black Door. Gods have mercy.
I trained in Hammerfell during my journeyman years. Redguard smiths are second to none.
I traveled far and wide when I was younger. Glad to have settled down finally.
I help my husband Rustleif run the forge. He's a marvel with steel.
I married Rustleif when he was in Hammerfell, apprenticing under my father.
The only thing I dislike about my husband's homeland is the cold. Why is it always so cold?
We discovered recently that I am with child. I'll need to stop working next season.
I work in the mine, just like everyone else.
Used to be twice as many miners working here before all this trouble started.
I mine. Work the smelter. Ain't much else to tell.
Been mining all my life. Quicksilver is as much my home as anywhere.
Damn Imperials. They won't hold Dawnstar forever.
Why are you speaking to me, Imperial?
The nightmares in Dawnstar have lifted, and I hear you helped that happen. You have my thanks.

Everyone thinks I'm too young to be a ship's captain, but I'm going to prove them wrong.
I don't buy all that talk about ship captains having to be stern and strict. I want my crewmen to enjoy their work.
I inherited the ship when my mother passed away. She spent her life on the water, and now I do, too.
I'm good with stars and charts, but I admit I've got some things to learn about leading men.
I plan to spend all the days I got left on the water. It's where I belong.
Once sailing gets in your blood, it don't get out.
I been a sailor for so long, I could navigate these rivers an' seas blindfolded.
Cap'n Wayfinder's as green as seaweed, but he's learnin'.
I don't like taking orders from a boy, but I need the gold.
I could run this ship better than that boy who calls himself a captain. Maybe one day I'll do something about it.
The captain inherited the Sea Squall from his mother when she died. Maybe I can inherit the ship if he dies...
Not a day goes by that I don't think about finding a new ship. I guess it's easier just to stay put.
You should talk to Rustleif. Get some proper steel.
Old lady Frida is a grouch, but she sure can whip up a cure for the Rattles fast.
Beware of Frostmere Crypt, friend. Heard some bandits are living in the ruins now.
Giants have been spotted up near Red Road Pass. Best to keep away and avoid it entirely.
Dawnstar is the last port of call before Solitude. Damn rebels aren't taking it.
We won't give up this port to the Imperials without a fight, don't you worry.
Dangerous post, Dawnstar. If the bandits don't get you, the animals will.
Here to dig. That's all.
Dawnstar's got its problems, but as long as the ore is good, I'll stay.
Here to mine?
Quicksilver ore is rare. Worth digging.
Been working in Iron-Breaker since I was a boy.
Iron's a good, stout metal. A fine thing for a Nord to dig.
Plenty of iron to dig.
Mining's an honest trade. No real tricks to it.
I work for the Windpeak Inn. You should head on inside.
Thoring runs the inn. Speak to him.
Don't make a mess of this.
Let's just get this over with.
Why are you here, outsider?
Please, help Yamarz. Do whatever you can. Our tribe depends on you.
I must focus now. This ritual is very important.
I will stay right here and wait for you to bring me what I need.
Do you bring word from Malacath?
Do whatever Yamarz asks of you. It cannot make things worse.
Speak to Yamarz. Convince him to let you help him.
You should not be here, outsider.
We have angered Malacath, and so we must be punished.
Our tribe has survived this long without you interfering. We'll be fine.
We have sworn loyalty to Yamarz. He will see us through these dark times.
By the Ashpit, we can't go on like this.
You must help us appease Malacath.
Please hurry. We are counting on you.
It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad.
But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones.
Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery.
That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside.
Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary?
The very thought breaks my heart.
Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary.
Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even.
Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.
I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn.
And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his... ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting at any time!
It's under your feet, lad. Just follow the smell.
It's under your feet, lass. Just follow the smell.

I'm one of the last members of the Blades.
A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer.
For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose.
Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them.
Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.
astonished
Interesting. Same dragon...

The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is.
Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else.
The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on.
And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened.
Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?
frowning, thinking hard
decisively - you've finally made up your mind about what to do
I never thought I'd see another friendly face again.
We need to get to safety as soon as possible. Let's move.
I cannot thank you enough for rescuing me from this place. I suspect I'd never again see the light of day otherwise.
But why would you risk your life for me, a stranger?
Welcome to our home.
Mother, what's the meaning of this? Who have you brought into our home?
Avulstein, put that down! He's here to help us find Thorald!
Avulstein, put that down! She's here to help us find Thorald!
How do we know he's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
How do we know she's not spying for the Battle-Born? This was foolish!
We can't trust anyone! Who knows what they'll do if they find me here.
I can't take any more of this. No weapons, please. Let's just talk.
All right, mother.
So, you're here to help?
Who are you? What are you doing here?
Are you working with the Battle-Borns? Speak now before I put you in the ground!
I know that Thorald's not dead. I just know it. The Imperials have him, and are keeping him somewhere. But I don't know where.
Those damned Battle-Borns... they know something. They're hiding it. They practically taunt us with it. They must have some sort of proof!
There's got to be something in that house of theirs. I just know it.
I don't dare leave the house myself. So I need your help.
My brother, Thorald. He was fighting for the Stormcloaks, and went missing. Everyone assumes he's dead.
But he's not. I just know it. The Imperials captured him, and they're holding him someplace. The Battle-Borns know where.
I'd go and search their house for proof, but they want me too. I'd be captured, and then we'll never know what happened to him.
So I need someone to find that proof for me.
Anything, anything at all would be a start. Then we can figure out how to get to him.
I'm sorry for doubting you, friend. You have my thanks.
Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away!
I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it.
Anything that confirms that Thorald isn't dead, but is being held captive. I know those Battle-Borns have it.
They'd be hiding it, of course. Wouldn't want it to get out that they've been lying this whole time.
But you might be able to butter them up enough to lower their guard.
I knew it! Let me see, please!
The Thalmor? By the Nine, it's worse than I thought.
So... Northwatch Keep. Then we know where to hit them.
Well, where is it? Forgive me, but I don't dare just trust your word, no matter who you are.
I knew he wasn't gone, I just knew it!
Please, get that to Avulstein right away.
Are you sure? I doubt you stand a chance against the Thalmor.
I can have a group of men ready at a moment's notice. Many would be willing to help rescue my brother.
Very well. I'll give you a chance. But if you can't do it, I will.
Exactly. Together we stand more of a chance of making this work.
Make your way to Northwatch Keep in Haafingar. I'll meet you near there, and we'll plan our assault.
What? You, alone, reasoning with the Thalmor? That's madness, friend.
You're serious, aren't you?
We kill every Thalmor between us and Thorald, and we bring him out alive. Let's go.
in normal, bland and pleasant tone of voice (servant)
in a low nervous undertone, trying not to be overheard
in a low undertone, trying not to be overheard
And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!
So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!
For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both heavens and earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!
Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this.
I'm glad we agree on this.
Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this.
Hmm. I guess I'll defer to your judgment on this one, but I think it's a mistake.
We're off to a good start.
The great stronghold of Narzulbur welcomes you, outsider.
Come to purchase ebony? Our Gloombound Mine runs thick with black veins.
The blessings of the mine have been many, but I have no mate to share them.
I am proud to have a mate to share in my blessings.
Been married many times, but the gods keep taking them from me.
I'm hoping this wife can outlast the winter.
I've read the entrails many times, but can't fathom why Mauhulakh's wives keep finding tragedy.
All my auguring never predicted this. A woman for Mauhulakh, eh? We'll see how this goes.
Urog and Dushnamub were such lovely children. I held them as they watched their mothers die after birth. They know me best, now.
[QUOTE]opinions[QUOTE] should be said with heavy derision
Yatul and I tend to dote on Mauhulakh. You know how aunts can be with their favorite nephew.
Mauhulakh. He wants to be a leader but spends too much time moping over women. Bolar and I should be all he needs.
Well at least now Mauhulakh has nothing to whine about. Until this one dies, too.
Orc chiefs should be strong and stand alone. They need no companions. Progeny is a poor excuse.
I know I sound abrasive. It's just that I love Mauhulakh so much that I want us to be happy together.
My brother keeps trying to spin these fantasies to me about my aunts and our father. He's crazy.
Uglarz is a great huntress. Perhaps she can teach me something new.
I never would have thought, but Uglarz is an even better hunter than Yatul was. The things I'm learning now...
Yatul's been teaching me to hunt. I'm still learning, but she's the best teacher I could have.
Sometimes I wonder if my aunts are right about my father -- he does seem weak.
New to Narzulbur? If you're smart, you'll keep moving. There is a wicked shadow over this place.
Haven't you seen how my aunts act with my father? It's beyond strange.
Glad my father seems to have found someone. I just hope she can hold her own against my aunts.
I never knew my mother, but I doubt even she acted as affectionate with my father as Yatul and Bolar do.
I think I like this new mate of my father's. I mean... nothing like that. I just think she's nice.
My sister is blind. I've told her she shouldn't spend so much time with Yatul, but she won't listen. Thinks she's nice.
Gadba and me came to work the mine. The plan is to get rich and then go back to Largashbur and take over!
Mauhulakh brought us in when he found ebony in the mine. Not enough men in town to work it, so here we are.
One of these days we need to head back to the Rift. Get some of that good Riften mead.
Mul is the smart one. I go where he tells me.
Mining is tough, but Mul says the money is good so we mine.
When we go back to Largashbur we'll be kings. I like Narzulbur, but don't tell Mul.
I used to have five good men who worked the mill with me. Then this war started and they all ran off. Idiots with mead in their blood.
There's plenty of good wood around here, but I just can't harvest it all by myself. Everyone able-bodied is fighting.
Of course, without functioning mills, who will make the arrows for our soldiers? Men have no sense of irony.
Welcome, welcome, welcome! Don't see many strangers out here. Come to get your hands dirty on a real farm?
Nothing tastes better than food you've grown yourself. Something magic about dirt and sunshine making food.
The weather's harsh, but I like to think my sunny personality is what helps the grain grow.
Bolfrida is certainly grating, but she pays well. Thankfully nobody from the city can see me out here.
Farm work is hard work. It's good to relax when I can, but I still have to listen to my brothers harping about [QUOTE]injustices.[QUOTE]
Of course working for Bolfrida isn't my first choice. But what else can a Dunmer do out here?
My sister and I both work for the Nords. Our brother is ashamed of us, but at least we can affort to eat.
Starting to get too old to work all day, but hopefully Master Hlaalu will let me slow down a bit.
Every now and then someone from the city comes by. Think they aren't used to seeing a Nord working for a Dark Elf.
Better to work in the cold than in the heat, I say. Though some sun would be nice.
Master Cruel-Sea comes and works the fields sometimes. I don't think the Mistress likes it, but she won't come out here to catch him.
Once the sun goes down, it's just me and the dogs. They keep me warm, and don't talk too much.
I wonder if I could put the dogs to work somehow. But I don't really have the heart to force them.
Calm yourself, Galmar. Save it for the battlefield.
Our men are getting massacred out there. Damn Imperials.
We can't march on Solitude. Not yet. One thing at a time.
We need to move faster. Keep them off balance.
It's working, Galmar. Our patience has won us friends and allies. And our armies are systematically taking care of the rest.
Is there any news from High Rock?
Not a peep. Those prissy Bretons can't be made to lift a finger to help their neighbors.
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised. They've never had many problems with the Empire.
Those milk drinkers? Might as well be elves. Think they're better than us.
Regardless. It appears Skyrim must stand alone. Again.
I'm still not sure I understand what you're asking.
A navy, my lord. We could stop the influx of Imperial troops to Solitude, and choke their northern lines.
But most of their supply routes come south, from Cyrodiil.
But imagine -- fleets of ships sailing from Windhelm, all bearing the Stormcloak flag! It would be glorious!
And I suppose the Cruel-Seas would be just the clan to provide ships and men?
You need but ask.
I'll think on this, but I make no promises.
I can ask no more. Thank you, my lord!
Captain, I've been receiving complaints about this Giordano woman.
Yes, sir. I've been trying to quiet her, but she's insistent. She thinks she can find out who's been killing the women...
I don't care if she can find a living dwarf -- I can't have her stirring up trouble. We have enough problems as it is.
Yes, sir. I'll try to contain her.
See that you do. I will not let Windhelm descend into chaos over a few overactive imaginations.
What's the current spirit among the dark elves?
As restless as ever, sir, but I don't see them taking any kind of incendiary action. Not soon, anyway.
Laughs (black humor) at the last bit
Unsure how to react to the uncomfortable joke
Carry on, Lonely-Gale. And loosen yourself a bit.
Galmar thinks we should double our men in the Reach.
A reasonable strategy.
he's giving him permission to share his opinion
Well, sir, the hold of Falkreath is fairly vulnerable, and blocks the only road from Cyrodiil.
A good point, old friend.
To be sure, my lord, I am not skilled in the arts of war or military tactics.
But you're able to see the whole in the parts, and for that I'm grateful.
As you wish, sir.
Sir, there continues to be unrest in the Gray Quarter.
Blasted dark elves. I don't suppose you could tell them that I presently have larger concerns? Such as all of Skyrim?
They don't seem to be very sympathetic to our cause, sir.
Deep sight before entire line
Of course, my lord.
Jorleif, I want you to send a messenger to our western camps.
And the message, sir?
I'm diverting Gar and Haddring's men to join him.
Is that wise, sir?
It will work if we can pull Hran's men from the south. And find a bit of luck.
Of course. Something that seems to be in short supply these days.
I'm not seeking advice right now, friend. Just send the message.
So what's the news on the street, Captain?
The dark elves are uneasy. There's a killer on the streets. And Viola Giordano won't leave me alone.
How would you like a drink?
Very much so.
Calixto, someone left an interesting ring in here a few weeks ago. Would you like a look?
Of course, my dear. It may prove to be quite the curiosity! One must always be alert.
Well, I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it.
Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.
Oh dear. What should I do?
Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally. I can keep it safe.
Oh, thank the gods you're in Windhelm, Calixto!
Think nothing of it.
Oh, Jora. Good to see you. I was wondering if you might ask Lortheim something for me.
Don't bother. I don't have much chance of seeing my husband these days. He's always up in the palace with Ulfric.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything all right?
It's been better, I'll be honest with you.
Here, let me get you some mead. This one's on me.
I just don't know what to do anymore. He's hardly ever in the temple. I see him at breakfast, and that's it.
I know, dear. He's a busy man, though, and loyal to the Stormcloaks.
What about being loyal to his wife?
I... I'm sorry, dear, I've got some other customers. I'll be back around in a minute.
Don't you ever find it demeaning, working for that Nord family?
Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble.
Fine, then. I guess some Dunmer are content to be their pets.
Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?
What's new with the Cruel-Seas, Suvaris? Have they given you one of those helmets with the horns on them yet?
What do you want from me? I work for them ok? We're not friends. They pay me, and I get the job done. That's it.
Touchy. Maybe some Dunmer lives in you yet.
Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys.
Why do the Nords bother you so much, Ambarys?
Why do you even need to ask? They treat your people as bad as they do mine.
I think that's just their way. The Nords don't like anybody who's not a Nord, but they're not bad people, deep down.
Look around you. Don't you know what their little war is about? They want all non-Nords out of Skyrim. That means you and me.
Oh, I doubt that very much. Who would load their ships, then?
Just you wait and see.
How much do they pay you per day?
That's really none of your business...
How much?
Eight septims per day, plus lodging.
Eight septims for breaking your back, and then you live in squalor. How much is your dignity worth?
If it's all the same to you, Scouts-Many-Marshes prefers to eat and drink in peace.
Sorry, my scaly friend, you've come to the wrong place. Around here we don't ignore what's happening in the world.
Niranye, I just have to know -- what is your secret?
My... my what, now?
some slightly valley-girlish intonations (emphasized [QUOTE]aMAZed,[QUOTE] for instance)
Oh, just a matter of finding the right suppliers.
Well, I'll want to meet them next time they're around. Maybe you can give an introduction.
I'll consider it. Many of the people I deal with are... secretive. You know how it is.
Of course! I undersand completely. You just put us in a room, and I'll do all the talking. No worries at all.
Thanks for getting me out of that. Bashnag's coven chased me out and left me for dead down here. Nobody lasts too long with the spiders.
Please, will you help me get out of here? If the coast is clear, I'll make a break for it.
I'm too weak right now. Between the spiders and the coven, I'd be dead before escaping the cave.
I'm feeling better, but Bashnag's curse won't wear off for weeks.
I won't be myself for some time. I just need to get out of here and recover.
Bashnag cursed me. I can't cast a spell to save my life right now. I'll have to wait until the way out is safe.
Please, let me know if it seems safe to leave.
I am, and I don't want to hear your moral judgments about it, either. I wouldn't have had to study in secret in the old days.
I left for a few days in Riften. When I came back Bashnag accused me of trying to sell him out to the Thalmor. I was cursed and chased off.

Bashnag's circle of mages. We - well [QUOTE]they[QUOTE] live here. They made it pretty clear that I'm no longer welcome.
These are no dainty college mages. Bashnag has the skill of a magister and the mind of a warlord. This is a dangerous bunch.
They're good company if you want to study necromancy in peace, though.
Thank you. When I find my daughter, it will be thanks to you.

No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.
I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.
They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered it from listening to them talk when they thought I was out.
I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him.
Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it.
That's it. Now, let's get out of here.
Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen.
Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons.
Come on now, we discussed that. I wouldn't be traveling all of Skyrim. It'd just to Whiterun and back, that's it.
Tomorrow. I'll let you know tomorrow.
Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!
Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!
And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!
We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars!
But you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, [QUOTE]Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter.[QUOTE]
[QUOTE]I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.[QUOTE]
Aye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!
And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!
The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!
Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?

Thought you might be open to doing it again... for a tidy sum.
Heard you hit somebody in town not too long ago.
I'll pay to do the same, to a certain special someone.
So you like to hurt people, huh? The town is still talking about what you did.

Yeah. You beat people up.
Got someone I want you to hurt. Don't worry, I can pay.

I need someone to do that to someone. I'll even pay.
I heard you hurt someone in town not too long ago.
I'll pay you to hurt someone else. Okay?
I heard about what you did. You hurt someone. Bad.

Good. Maybe things will be different around here from now on.
Good. Let's hope it's a lesson learned.
You what? Oh. That. Good. I hope there was a lot of blood.
It can't be traced back to me, can it? Was there lot's of crying? I hope so.
Really? I hope it hurt.
Hmph. Good. That'll teach 'em.
Really? Good. Was there a lot of screaming? Never mind. I don't want to know.
Were there tears? I hope everyone can see the bruises.
Good. I hope it hurt a lot, after all the pain I've been put through.
No funerals, just some pain. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
No killing. I'm not hiring the Dark Brotherhood, here. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
Just cause some pain. I don't want a death on my conscience. If you get caught, it's not my problem.
Hurt him. I mean her. Whichever. No killing though. And I ain't paying your fine if you get caught.
I hope I can hear the screams. But don't let on it's from me! And I'm not paying your fine if you get caught.
Make it quick, but make it hurt. If you get caught by the guards, I don't know you.
Good. No killing, though. Don't get arrested. I won't help you.
Make it hurt. But not too much. No killing. And don't let the guards catch you.
It should hurt. A lot. But I'm not paying for murder. Oh, if you're caught, it's not my problem.
Good. Now remember - pain, and lots of it. But not to the death. If they arrest you, it's not my problem.

Not here. Let's speak at my home, where we can be alone, unwatched.
Thorald's disappearance has been hard on all of us, but Avulstein has taken it badly.
He's afraid of being taken as well, so he hasn't left the house. All he talks about is Thorald.
Please, help Avulstein if you can. Something has to be done, or we're all going to lose our minds.

Let's get out of here before we end up like Mercer!
Aye, there will be blood today. I can promise you that.
Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.
I'd just assume die before I'd let Mercer get those gems.
Do the Falmer also have no sense of smell? This place reeks!
The Eyes would go a long way in helping get the Guild back on its feet.
I can't wait to get my hands around that bastard's neck.
By Talos, Mercer has a lot to answer for.
This place is coming down. Let's get out of here!
With any luck, this will be Mercer's final day alive.
This place, it's like a maze. How did the dwarves find their way around?
This is just like old times.
Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer may be blind, but they can still hear us.

Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand.
I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?
Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there.
Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!

Quintus, could you fetch me a copy of The Firmament? I need to compare the old star charts to today's.
Did they really record the star positions from Curalmil's tomb? There's no way it's that precise.
Confound it, boy, I know what I'm doing. It will help me determine the season of his burial, which I can cross-reference.
I... I apologize, master.
Don't waste time apologizing, just find the book!
Master, I have a question about infusions of arrowroot.
Damn it, child, didn't I tell you to gather my notes on sub-material properties?
Yes, and I'm working on it, but I'm also trying to...
When I ask you for something, I expect it to get done.
Yes, master, I know. I just want to keep up my own projects as well.
You can waste your own time, not mine. An apprentice obeys his master. A good one does, at least.
Yes, master. I'm sorry, I'll get back to those notes straight away.
I'm sorry to always be so hard on you, boy. I just worry I don't have much time left.
I know, master. Don't say such things -- there is always time.
Don't be so sure. Now, have you finished grinding the dried snowberries?
Erm... no. Not yet. I'm sorry, I was reading up on the effects of distillation.

Just wondering when you'll be ready to give it up and settle down. Seems like you're always working.
I just feel like if I'm not here, then something could go wrong. Nils is a hard worker, but I wouldn't trust him to run things.
One of these days he'll have to learn.
Perhaps. But not today.
I've been thinking about building that cabin we talked about.
There's a clear spot just west of Riften. You know the area?
I've been there before, but I don't know it well.
Well that's where I want to build. In the fall forest. Give it an easterly view. The sunrise is almost as pretty as you are.

Angry that her sister is threatening her unfairly. Emphasis on [QUOTE]you[QUOTE]... Dad told YOU to do that, not ME!
I guess you had your reasons.
None of my business.
I don't think there's a need for that!
Was that really necessary?
Why are you doing that?
Guess they deserved it...
What's done is done.
Well... that was an unpleasant bit of business.
I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...
Remind me not to make you angry.
I guess I can look the other way, this time.
Self-pity
Don't worry about it. Keep it.
I guess you can have that.
You must really need that.
I'll look the other way this time.
I didn't really want that anyway.
I suppose that's yours now.
You could have asked before just taking it.
All right... End it...
I can't believe it...
Please... mercy...
mortally wounded, dying but not dead
Sigh... I'm not proud of it. I'm terrified of that place and Aunt Agna knows it.
My Da locked me in there in a drunken rage when he left us... three days in there eating the offerings left for our dead before Aunt Agna found me.
I'm afraid you do.
It is time for us to go.
Die, worm!
The College will not fall!
We will prevail!
I'll not go down without a fight!
You dare approach me here? Are you mad? You cannot hope to defeat me!
We knew you would succeed.
Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.
The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world.
It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove that the world is not ready for such a thing.
We shall safeguard it... for now.
You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives.
You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage.
A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.
Things look quiet enough here. Come on. There's my uncle.

Show those thieves not to steal from Lucan Valerius!
The sooner you find the claw, the sooner our lives can get back to normal.
You're back from Bleak Falls. Did you find anything?

realizing how the robbery could negatively impact sales
Lucan over in the Riverwood Trader says thieves broke into his store. Strange, he says they hardly took anything.
Did you hear? The Riverwood Trader was robbed! Poor Lucan must be torn to pieces over it.
I heard Lucan yelling the other day about a thief breaking into his store. It wasn't me, honest!
angry at her brother's stubbornness
Lucan's dead. I guess I'm in charge of the Riverwood Trader now.
I guess Lucan will never see the golden claw again now.
Mara bless you for agreeing to help us.

describing the ornament lovingly
You mean before he died? We had a break in. Thieves didn't touch anything on the shelves, or any coin, just one thing.
A solid gold ornament, in the shape of a dragon's claw.
I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess.
Damn thieves. As if things weren't bad enough.
Good luck. Lucan and I will be waiting for you back in the shop.

This is High Hrothgar, our temple, sanctuary, and home. We ask that you respect our solitude while you are here.
Your training proceeds well, Dragonborn.
What do you need, Dragonborn?
Do you need something?
Eh? Did you say something?
You'll have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in my right ear.
Did you need something?
Drem Yol Lok. Greetings.
Speak. I will listen.

Ah! You made it! Good to see you, my friend. I'll never forget how you saved my life from those Thalmor maniacs.
So you made it out. Good for you. Don't expect me to thank you. I still remember what you did to me.
Ah... so tender. Come here, you morsel!
Keep an eye out for wolves if you're headed up the path to High Hrothgar.
What is your need, Dragonborn?
Lead me into battle.
I answer the call of the Dragonborn.
I serve the Dragonborn.
You have no business in our stronghold, outlander.
Malacath blesses this land for the Orcs. And the Orcs alone.
We won't kill you, outlander, but we don't want you here.
Most of my kin are in the longhouse. Come back during the day if you wish to trade.
It's late outlander. Come back in the morning if you need to spend coin.
We only trade during the day, outlander. At night, most rest in the longhouse.
I'm here to mine, outlander. So unless you want to dig, get out.
I have metal to dig.
Malacath has given me the task to mine. Good ore brings strength to our people.
Every Orc learns the heavy labor of mining. All spend years in the caves.
The mines are hard, but Malacath rewards those who rise to the challenge.
Now if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.
Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga.
Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization.

There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor.
Have you by chance heard of the [QUOTE]Gourmet[QUOTE]? Read his cookbook? It's become quite a phenomenon.
The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef.
Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to uncovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.
very serious - almost a bit angry
Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Now get going.
Let's show these rebels what real soldiers look like.
But don't underestimate the Stormcloaks. Many are Legion veterans. They may be traitors, but they know how to fight.

If you beat up my sister Sissel, I won't tell.
Are you new around here? You should go to the inn if you need a place to stay.
Sissel thinks she's so special. No way she's more special than me.
I'm the older sister, by nearly five minutes. Sissel's barely worthy to walk in my shadow.
I wish I could be an adventurer like you, and go wherever I want.
I had a dream that there was a good dragon. He was old and gray, but he wasn't scary.
Most days, I do all I can to stay away from my sister and my father. The beating's the same from either one.
Some day soon I'll stop being afraid. Jouane is teaching me magic. He says I'm real good.
Do yourself a favor and don't have children. They're good for nothing at all.
I got enough troubles, so don't go adding to them.
I spend every day tending the fields, and what do my daughters do? Nothing! Complain and caterwaul! Sleep and eat! Useless!
Curse my good-for-nothing daughters! My wife was twice the woman they'll ever grow to be. She gave her life birthing them. What a waste.
Did you have any luck talking to my father?
I hope you can change my father's mind. He can be a little stubborn.
Said with enthusiasm and a bit of envy.
My father, Mralki, manages the inn. He used to be a soldier, but he left that life behind.
If you need a meal or a room, I've got both.
I only take real coin here, no handouts and no bartering.
That fool son of mine, Erik, wants to be an adventurer. He a good-natured lad, but he's got no idea how dangerous the world really is.
Some folk here will tell you I'm sheltering my boy too much, but I ask you, isn't it a father's duty to keep his children safe?
Name's Ennis. If you've got friends who do business in Whiterun, they might know me.
You talk to Reldith yet? She's like a mother to me.
You here from the city? I visit Whiterun from time to time, mostly to make deals.
Reldith is the hardest-working farmer in Rorikstead, but I'm the one with a head for business.
Did you see those guards? Get out of line, and you'll have them to deal with.
We're honest, hardworking folk here, and we don't suffer beggars or thieves.
City folk might look down on us, but what's wrong with farming? Everything we've got, we had to earn with our own sweat.
You look like the adventurous sort. You should talk to Erik, the innkeeper's son. He could use your help.
If you've got some business in Rorikstead, you should start by speaking to Jouane.
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude but Jouane's the one who deals with people. I'm afraid I lost my charm years ago.
No offense intended, but I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I was a different man, once -- strong, commanding, ah, and young. But the Great War was a long time ago.
If you're thinking of setting up to farm, you picked the right place.
Peace and prosperity are all the good folk of Rorikstead want in life.
I'm sure it's hard to believe, but I was once a bold adventurer like you, ready to face any danger.
Have you spoken to Erik? His father won't let him go out and seek his fortune in the world. Maybe you can help.
Do enjoy your time in Rorikstead. This close to the Reach, well, we are truly blessed to have such fertile ground.
Come to gawk at the Dark Elf?
Well look at us. Like two gray specks in the snow.
I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer. Not a... a great wanderer, like you.
No, I want to take my time with it.
Can I help with it? Maybe just the cuirass?
This is more delicate work than you're used to.
I did that engraved piece just last month!
This is the royal armor, lass. Maybe in a few years.
Did you use my good hammer?
Blast, girl, I told you to leave my tools alone. You have yours and I have mine.
I didn't touch it!
Hammers don't have legs.
Did you look behind the forge? I think I saw it there.
Oh... yes. Now that you mention it, I think... sorry about that.
Captain, captain!
Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?
[QUOTE]Investigating[QUOTE] is sarcastic.
I... well. Perhaps. But still! It's curious.
Captain Lonely-Gale! I've been looking for you everywhere!
He had been avoiding her
Have you thought about my invitation?
I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
meekly, somewhat embarrassed.
Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day.
Do you think those dark elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all.
Viola, dark elves sleep just like the rest of us.
You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.
I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Hello, captain! Can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day that I wanted to share with you.
What did you hear?
It was an old Nord proverb. It said, the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one.
I didn't lose a lover, Viola, I lost my wife. It's not the same thing.
Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?
No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now.
Store has just been robbed. Wants thieves to suffer.
I'm searching for my Fenrig. He was marching with Gjukar's men, who they say were wiped out here.
I've turned over every body, though, and I can't find him.
Please help me look. He has a bright red beard and hair.
Are you a fool? Look at the bodies around you. Even if you're blind, surely you smell the blood.
Come, help me search for Fenrig.
Ruki? Where is she?
We're expected to fight there tomorrow. Gjukar elected to camp here for the night. I don't like it, though.
Our fires are visible for miles. We're in a low valley. Sitting ducks.
If she's come this far from home, it must be important. Lead on. I just need to report back to camp by sunrise.
Have you been learning your ores?
I think I've got a handle on it, but Orichalcum is confusing.
Don't even bother with that one. Leave it to the orcs.
Oh, right. That makes sense. Kind of a messy metal, anyway.
Is Ulfric's armor done yet?
Fenrig! You're alive!
Of course I am. What brings you here?
I had heard that Gjukar's men were wiped out. I came to find you.
But that battle isn't expected until tomorrow... Ruki, what's going on?
tearful
It doesn't matter. I'm here. We're together now. And we will be forever.
How wonderful. Like the sea, their love roils and swells, but brings life and nourishment to all.

Foolish old woman! You know nothing! Nothing of our struggles, our suffering!
Nothing? And what of my son? Hmm? What of Thorald? Is he nothing? So don't talk to me about suffering!
Your son chose his side, and he chose poorly. And now he's gone. Such is the way of war. The sooner you accept his loss, the better.
I will never accept his death! My son still lives. I feel it in my heart. So tell me, Battle-Borns, where is he? Where are you holding my Thorald?

Arch-Mage, the Synod have contacted us again, asking if we've any word on their researchers. What shall I tell them?
What did you tell them last time?
That they had arrived, asked for information which was provided to them, and went on their way with no suggestion of further interaction.
That hasn't changed, has it? Then just tell them again.
Should we consider investigating the matter?
No, I don't think so. Respond to their request, and we'll leave it at that.
Yes, Arch-Mage. Thank you.
Err, excuse me Enthir. Might I have a moment?
Yes, err, apologies for the intrusion. I was wondering, err, if you could possibly, ah, procure a few select items for me.
Really, Arniel? Because I seem to recall doing just that for you recently, at which point you assured me that you'd cover my expenses.
Ahh, hmm. Yes. I, err, I was unaware that I had forgotten that. I will, err, I mean I'll take care of that as soon as possible.
So, Arniel. How's that little project of yours coming along? Any progress worth mentioning?
Oh, that. Err, yes. It's... It's quite promising, I believe. Definitely on the right track. Results, err, results should be soon.
sarcastic, mocking
Oh, no. Err, wouldn't do to say at all. Not, err, not now. Not at all. I have far too many things to do still.
mocking, dismissive
You've been spending a fair bit of time with Sergius lately, I see.
What? Why, the audacity! How dare you imply such a thing!
Calm down! Why are you over-reacting? I was going to ask if the two of you are collaborating on research!
Oh! Well... I... I'm sorry. Yes, we have been working on something together.
This is why I avoid being social.
Ah, my dearest Urag! How are you today, my green-skinned friend?
Did you need something, Colette?
I only wish to escape the constant glaring of my [QUOTE]colleagues[QUOTE] and discover an opportunity for repose. Your Arcanaeum is so lovely and quiet...
I... see.
Don't fret, my fanged acquaintance. I shan't trouble you a bit.
Was there something specific you needed?
I'm positive whatever I require will be revealed to me on its own, in due time.
So, you don't need anything then.
Oh, my dear Urag. You're trying so hard to help. I do hope you're not disappointed.
[QUOTE]Disappointed[QUOTE] is not the word I would choose, Colette. Excuse me.
Mirabelle, would you please make sure my schedule is clear for the next few days? I'm working on something important.
Your schedule is always clear, Arch-Mage. I see to that.
Ah, yes. True. Well, thank you.
Sir, the Imperial Legion has again requested assistance. What shall I tell them?
The same thing we've told them before, and the same thing we've told these Stormcloaks. It's not our concern.
Forgive me, but at what point does it become our concern?
Never. The College cannot become mired in local politics. What happens inside these walls is our worry. What happens outside is theirs.
Is there anything new I should be aware of, Mirabelle?
I'm dealing with a few new research proposals, evaluating the results of three long-term projects, and keeping an eye on our new Apprentices.
There were also two items requiring disciplinary action recently.
Everything's under control, then? Right. Keep up the good work.
Yes, thank you Arch-Mage.
I'm not so sure the few guards they've assigned to the farm are enough.
It will have to do. Besides, if it came to blows, I'm sure the Snow-Shod's would come out here and assist us.
I suppose so. I just fear they won't make it out here in time.
Just worry about keeping the fields tended and let the Jarl worry about the war.
My darling, you've made me the happiest woman in all Skyrim.
It brings me joy to hear that, but what possessed you to say that so suddenly?
I've already lost a family, and we're about to start a new one. I don't want that to happen again.
My sweet Leanora, I will never let anything happen to us. I promise.
Can you believe we're here? Saarthal, of all places.
I'm surprised that the College is allowed to excavate here.
I bet your family would be amazed, right?
Amazed isn't the right word. They might find this... offensive.
Are you looking for any specific volumes, Drevis?
confused, distracted

Can I help you with anything, Nirya?
I was wondering. Has Faralda been in recently? Borrowed any books that you can recall?
Nirya...
Did she, perhaps, mention any dangerous research she might be working on? Anything that could get her in trouble?
I'm here to help you with books, Nirya. That's all.
Ah, yes. Of course. No, I don't need anything.
Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.
Can't talk long, got to keep my eyes open for Mercer.
Hold your thoughts 'til after we untangle this mess.
Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.
We can talk after I find out what's going on.
I'm relieved Brynjolf has an open mind or that could have gotten bloody.
How can I help?

Quickly, what is it?
I can't believe this is happening, lad.
I can't believe this is happening, lass.
Just take a step back and let me figure this out. Then we'll talk.
Can't talk.... I'm outta' here.
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.
I dare Mercer to come back here! He sets one foot in the cistern and I'll cut it off!
Look at that dark elf whore... strutting around like she's innocent. I'll cut her open from gullet to groin!
I never saw this coming, I thought we were just having a run of bad luck.
So it's true. You've turned traitor. I can't believe it.
I hope he turns up soon... he needs to answer for his betrayal.
I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?
If you don't have a good reason to be partnered with Karliah, you're dead.
How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.
They say that Karliah murdered Gallus, but I'm not so sure.
If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!
They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.
Punishment's too good for Mercer Frey. The only penalty for his betrayal is death.
Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.
There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp.
I heard what happened and the Guild owes you thanks for bringing this to light.
I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.
How dare you bring that Dunmer bitch here.
Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.
What in blazes is going on? Are you working with Karliah?
Better question would be [QUOTE]what did he leave.[QUOTE]
Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.
We've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer.
Any luck on your end?
Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project.
If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.
Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult.
I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us.
Isn't it amazing?
Just think. We're the first to set foot here in thousands of years.
Patience. Give me a moment and I'll explain everything.

Sky Haven Temple. An ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden deep in the crags of the Reach. That's where we'll find Alduin's Wall.

Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again.
Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...
with a derisive laugh
We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than I could have hoped for.
This looks promising. Akaviri stonework, I think. Reminds me a bit of Cloud Ruler Temple.
I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.
Lead on to Sky Haven Temple.
We'll meet up near Karthspire.
Let's get this door open and see what we've got.
Alduin isn't getting any weaker while we stand around here gawping at the architecture.
Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy.
Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten.
The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...

Let's see what Esbern has to say.
Amazing, eh? To be standing at the very entrance to Sky Haven Temple itself!
We must be getting close. We should proceed cautiously.
Are you sure this is the right way?
I've told you where Sky Haven Temple is. I'll trust you to get us there in one piece.
Are we close? Thalmor spies could be anywhere.
I don't like being out in the open like this.
distraught - husband was murdered at his own wedding
Please, enjoy the festivities! This is a day of peace and happiness, when Imperials and Stormcloaks join together, as equals!
My wife is dead! Dead!
Now now, fella. Let's not get too close to my new bride, eh?
Well aren't you a pretty thing? Should my new bride by worried? He he he he.
Make sure to get yourself something to drink.
You hungry? There's plenty of food. Eat up, now.
What's going on? Why would somebody do that?
This wedding is boring. I wish they had jugglers.
When my aunt got married, they had a cake that was three feet tall. I got really sick that day.
I heard Vittoria Vici is the Emperor's cousin. I wish he came to the wedding. I never saw a real live Emperor before.
By the gods, the blood! The blood!
Vittoria did pretty well for herself, marrying that Asgeir. Not a bad looking fellow at all.
I love weddings, don't you?
I just can't wait to be a bride someday. Someday...
happy that he gets to attend the wedding
him saying this is really creepy
The Emperor's cousin is dead! This is a disaster!
By all the gods, the groom has been killed. At his own wedding! I can only think of my own husband...
A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.
Oh, no no no... This is so wrong...
I'm so glad Vittoria and Asgeir chose a public reception. That way the entire city can share in their holy bond.
Oh, did you miss the ceremony? It was rather quick, actually. The couple seemed more concerned with their reception.
I just came to sing! This is a horror show!
If you want my opinion, I think they should have paid for an entire quartet. Plenty of bards at the College would have loved the opportunity.
Ahem. Mi mi mi mi. Pardon me. Just, um, warming up. Never know when I may be called upon for a ballad.
My daughter! Dead! Noooooo!
My nephew, the Emperor. Too busy to attend the wedding of his beloved cousin. We won't stand for this slight, I assure you.
What my daughter sees in that... barbarian, I'll never know.
The thought of paying a dowry to that, that... Stormcloak turns my stomach.
It was the Empire killed her! I know it! They killed her so they can blame it on the Stormcloaks!
My son is dead! At his own wedding! Only those Imperial dogs would have dared do something like this! Damn them all to Oblivion!
I still think my boy should have had a traditional Nord wedding. Outside, in the cool mountain air.
says [QUOTE]peace[QUOTE] like it's a dirty word.
My boy, he always did have an eye for the pretty ones. That Vittoria ain't bad, for an Imperial.
By Ysmir, this is horrible! I never wanted the girl dead, I swear!
Vittoria may be pretty, but does she have the right hips for the job? I want grandchildren, and lots of them.
To think, my little boy is married. And to an Imperial. Oh, they grow up so fast.
If my Asgeir is happy, then I'm happy. Really.
I never should have taken this job!
Sorry, no time to talk. I need to keep playing.
What an amazing day this has been. I hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm... I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness... for me.
Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks - all are welcome here!
Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines!
On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please - eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!
Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done!
Let's see his eminence try to ignore this.
Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude.
Now go. And give my best to the bride.
Please, enjoy yourself!
She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Aren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place.
Looks to be another cold day.
Aren't they all?
Not like this. Feels colder than usual. Bet it's those damned Mages.
I'm sure you're right.

And it's clear money matters more to Dagur than honor.
Eirid says the mages at the College are nice people, but you said they're bad.
Eirid's a little girl who doesn't understand that they're responsible for destroying our home.
Why did they do that? Why would they be so evil?
Because they don't care about you or I, cub. They think they're better than all of us, and that we can just be thrown away.
I hate them.
Ooh. What a fun trick. Teach me, teach me!
For someone called the [QUOTE]Listener,[QUOTE] you do an awful lot of shouting...

Oooh. Time to kill?
Finally!
Ooh. That had to hurt.
What? Why would the stranger attack innocent Cicero?
emphasis on [QUOTE]I[QUOTE]
What have I done, Listener? Has Cicero offended you?
By Sithis, you will pay for that!
Why you insolent little bastard...
It's... it's like watching an artist create a masterpiece.
And another soul for Sithis.
You are an inspiration. Do you know that?
What do you expect to find? My juggling balls? He he.
Hey, that's my lint! Ha, Cicero is just joking. You can have it.
If I had anything worth giving, I'd have offered it already.
Anything good in there?
See if they have any cheese. I'm getting a bit... peckish.
You're putting your hand... in my pocket? Have you gone complete cracked?
I've hardly anything worth pickpocketing...
This how you get your thrills? Feeling up an old man?
I haven't been touched like that since I visited a certain brothel in the city of Sentinel...
It would seem you're not the accomplished pickpocket you think you are...
What do you hope to find? Sweets and my dolly? Or maybe some of my spare Nightshade?
You're not actually... picking my pocket? Well, you've got guts. I'll give you that.
What is this madness? Rexus, help me!
Wait! That's not how this is supposed to work!
What are you doing? I thought we were friends!
You can't be serious.
Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble staying on my feet at the moment.
Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend.
Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine.
Stand back and behold my handiwork.
Three in fact. They're my own recipe. Brought them over here from my days as a bartender in Gideon.
First is the [QUOTE]Velvet Lechance[QUOTE] which is a mixture of blackberry, honey, spiced wine and a touch of nightshade... perfectly safe, I assure you.
Second, we have the [QUOTE]White-Gold Tower[QUOTE] which is heavy cream with a layer of blended mead, lavender and dragon's tongue on top.
Last, and only for the bravest of souls, we have the [QUOTE]Cliff Racer[QUOTE] which is Firebrand Wine, Cyrodiilic Brandy, Flin and Sujamma.
I was hoping you'd offer. I didn't think it was my place to ask such a favor of you. I thank you.
I understand. Hopefully I'll be able to save my meager earnings up to buy them one day.
I... I... I don't know what to say. Such kindness is unheard of in these times.
Here. I want you to accept this as payment for your sacrifice and I... well, we both thank you.
Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design.
Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife.
The amethyst in the center represents The Hist, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives.
Don't mistake my political beliefs as a substitute for my family values. They're still my parents, and I love them dearly.
I just think they've let my sister's death skew their outlook on Ulfric and what he really brings to the table with this war.
I'm not so certain that Ulfric's intentions are as noble as they think. I think Ulfric cares about Ulfric and the rest is a smokescreen.
I'd... appreciate if you kept my opinion between us. The last thing I want to do is have my parents [QUOTE]lose[QUOTE] another child.
Yes, actually. I'm partnered with Maven Black-Briar. I put up a chunk of the gold she needed to get the place off the ground.
We've been staggeringly successful so far. In fact, I'm almost surprised how quickly she's generated business for us.
My name may not be on the label, but some of my blood, sweat and tears are in every drop. Uh, figuratively of course.
Lady Maven's been developing the secret recipe for Black-Briar Mead over the last several decades.
She uses a very secret blend of spices, fresh honey from Goldenglow Estate and specially constructed aging casks to ensure the best flavor.
Even when you get to the last sip in your flagon, it'll taste just as good as the first!
Damn it! Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
Look, just don't say anything to Maven, will you? I've spent weeks trying to get that right and if she sees how stupid I am, she'll get rid of me.
Yeah... fired. Sure. That's what I meant.
She's an absolute pleasure to work for! In fact, I almost feel guilty accepting pay from her.
Why, just this last week I was commenting to my fellow meadery workers just how lucky we are to be working for such a charitable family.
That is the truth, my friend! Maven is a saint and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
It's going to take a lot more than that.
Okay, look. If I'm caught saying anything bad about the meadery or the family, I'm a dead man.
I'm the fourth person to work the tasting counter in the last year. The last three are at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
Just take my advice and just get out of Riften as soon as you can.
Sure am! I thank my lucky stars every time I look to the night sky that Maven took me in and gave me this opportunity.
Only the best in all of Riften! I own Riften Fishery.
Started out with a single fishing pole and now I have an entire building and two boats to my name. Not bad for a middle-aged Nord, eh?
Too bad I haven't had the same success helping this city shed its poverty. Nivenor thinks I'm wasting my time trying, but I disagree.
Nivenor is my wife. How I was ever able to meet such a gorgeous creature is one of life's mysteries.
We're... at odds about my charity. She thinks the people in this town have become lazy and expecting a handout.
I try to include her in my lessons from Maramal over at the Temple of Mara, but she prefers to shop instead. Different strokes, eh?
Let me know if you find out anything about the fire.
Hroggar's fate is in your hands.
I hope Alva is not what you think.
humming
That's true, but I'm in a new house now. A better house.
Totally disinterested
But now Alva takes care of me. And I take care of her.
She came by so Alva could kiss her goodbye.
Then she left to join the Stormcloaks.
He was cruel to her. He would beat her every night.
It's no wonder she fled in the middle of the night.
Really? How nice.
Dreamy, like he's hypnotized.
Of course! I would do anything for you, my one and truest friend! What do you need from me?
Ah, the one generous soul amongst a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles!
If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to call upon me!
extravagantly
My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked!
petulantly
Indeed. Being a drunken boor is thirsty work. And I can't seem to find my way back to the bar...
Alms? Alms for a veteran?
Spare a bite for a poor old veteran?
Please, ma'am, I've got nowhere to go...
I lost my eye defending the Empire... Spare some grub for a veteran?
Embarrassed, trying not to make eye contact with a beggar
Embarrassed
Here, it's all I can spare...
Sure has been quiet around the shop lately.
We hardly ever get new customers anymore.
Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still...
I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk...
It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith.
We'll make it through, dear. We always do.
Who needs customers and their old junk?
Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!
Jovial, teasing
Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight?
Joking
Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started!
How's it coming there, Jawanan?
Slow, but looking good, sir.
Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood.
Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?
The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!
Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people.
You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue.
Passive aggressive
Vivienne, could you check out supplies of mandrake root?
Which one is that again?
A little exasperated
In that case, I'm pretty sure it tried to buy me a drink last night.
Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve.
Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months.
Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before.
Frustrated but determined
We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands.
New orders for the soldiers, Legate. Make sure they're distributed as noted.
Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders.
That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels.
Frustrated at commander
Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow.
Yeah, you said that yesterday.
cruel and mocking
Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials.
bored and casually threatening
I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!
I said shut up, scum!
So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?
Frustrated and angry
Big shipment coming in later tonight. I need you three working late.
A little sinister
Yeah, we'll get the valuables out of there, no problem!
My contact, she says Hammerfell steel is much desired by certain parties.
I know of a ship coming in from Hammerfell. Some cargo might get [QUOTE]lost[QUOTE]...
Why should we settle for half a fin when we could just take the whole whale?
Patience, sister. Patience.
Got any work?
I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything.
Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me.
You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand?
Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight.
My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie.
Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have.
Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies.
That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.
She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others.
What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?
You won't like it, my lady.
I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.
Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe.
I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.
slightly reproachful
Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us.
I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics.
I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger.
I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker.
You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this.
One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love.

Simmering resentment - the fortune should be hers
I'm afraid [QUOTE]acceptable[QUOTE] just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent.
Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis.
Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister.
That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement.
I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice.
I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay.
Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent.
Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?
Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them.
Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?
Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army.
Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer.
It's all we've got for today. Don't be greedy.
Fish? Again?
Potatoes? Again?
Eat up, Svari.
Maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow.
desperate
Where've you been all day?
Well, did you bring back any mead?
Humph. Some daughter you are.
Svari, Jala said you stole an apple from her cart yesterday. Is this true?
Just a little one! I was hungry!
I'll talk with Jala, dear. I'm sure she'll accept a potato as repayment.
I suppose. But Svari, we don't steal. We're better than that. Understand?
chastised
Father, could you clean up the house a little while I'm away?
Maybe. I'll see if I feel like it.
I'm on my feet all day. Can you please do this one thing for me?
Sure, whatever.
A word, my love?
What troubles you, darling?
I fear attendance is down. There are so few worshippers coming to see us. Could it be that the war has weakened their faith?
Nonsense, dear. I've had more visitors than ever seeking the wisdom of the hearth goddesses.
Ah, that must be it. So many of the men are serving in battle. I shall pray to Stendarr that they return victorious.
Silana, you don't seem yourself. Is something the matter?
Oh, yes sir. I feel many of Solitude's families are having trouble getting by, and the wealthy do nothing to help them!
Your compassion is admirable, but you see, we cannot help them all. The poor must learn from the examples of the gods and raise themselves up.
I respectfully disagree, sir. Stendarr and Zenithar may demand strength from them, but Mara and Dibella demand compassion from us.
I see you have meditated on this subject quite thoroughly. I shall not stop you, but please, try to attend to your temple duties as well.
Mistress, a word?
Certainly, acolyte. What troubles you?
I know you and father Rorlund have many duties to attend to in the temple, but sometimes I feel that there are more important matters to attend to.
What could be more important than hearing the prayers of the faithful, and answering the questions of the dedicated?
Mistress, the people of Solitude are destitute. Many are starving and desperate for work. We need to be more active, to reach out to them.
We took you in, didn't we? We would be glad to extend our welcome to any other who showed your dedication. What more could we do?
I know, and I appreciate it dearly. But I can't help but feel we could be doing more...
Kynareth has blessed you with tremendous compassion, Silana. You will find a way, I'm sure of it.
You there. Have you performed your voice exercises today?
Your solo performance is about a week away. I expect to hear your early rendition tomorrow, understand?
Pardon me, but I trust you've been working on your poem, on the classical heroes of Skyrim, yes?
Yes, Lady Ateia. My voice is strong as a Dragonborn's!
Always! Perfection takes dedication, after all!
Yes, madam. I know I have a lot to work on.
I've converted the classic tale of Eyldi the Bear to be performed with drums. I think you'll be impressed!
At this point, I hardly see how your advice would improve it. It's flawless.
Oh, thank you! I've been working on an original piece. I hope it can stand up to the classics!
Yes sir, Professor Gemane! It's a war epic about Hoag Merkiller's last stand!
Must it be written? Poetry is so dull when it isn't set to music.
Why do we always focus on retelling the old stories? There are so many new stories being made, right now...
Dismissively
How are your students coming along?
Yes, headmaster.
Passably. Aia is my star pupil. None of the others can hold a candle to her. Especially not that wretched llldi.
Some of them have a long way to go, but they're mostly passable. Don't let them hear I said that, though!
Bunch of distractions, if you ask me. They just interrupt the rest of my work.
Try not to play favorites, Lady Ateia. It does a disservice to the whole class.
Of course not! Complacency is the bane of art. They're in good hands with you, Inge.
I'm sorry to break it to you, Giraud, but students are an unfortunate necessity of a college. Do try to persevere.
What're you going to do after you graduate? I'm thinking of joining the Legion. I hear they're looking for skalds. Just think. Me - a war bard.
Lady Ateia has already arranged for me to perform in the court of the Jarl of Falkreath.
You'd better hope the war's over by then. The Stormcloaks would eat you alive!
As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?
This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded.
Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!
And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?
Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild.
emphasize [QUOTE]naive[QUOTE]
The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!
That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.
Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?
The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads.
I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.
The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.
My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.
Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.
Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.
That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes.
Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about.
I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment.
Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!
I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically.
He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair.
[QUOTE]Fair[QUOTE] is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this.
Brusquely
Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?
Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return.
Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.
And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.
Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!
On threat of what, exactly? This city wouldn't run without me! Now if you'll excuse me, my work awaits.
Make Laelette go away!
I can't tell you. She might hear me. She's so close.
If you can find me first, I can tell you.

Dragons, pah. They can be killed. The Blades killed many in their early days as dragon-slayers.
No, the dragons are merely the final portent of the End of Days.
I tried to tell them. They wouldn't listen. Fools. It's all come true... all I could do was watch our doom approach...
Oh, yes! The prophecies make clear the signs that will precede the end times. One by one, I have seen them fulfilled.
We must go, quickly now. Take me to Delphine. We have much to discuss.

Its location was lost for centuries, but I know where it is: Sky Haven Temple, an ancient Blades sanctuary, hidden within the crags of the Reach.
So far so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out.
We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder.
Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me.
Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen.
A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be.
A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...
mildly but with a threat
Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...
Tss! Get out of here, I saw nothing.
in an undertone, for the player's ears only (who is standing close)
Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up.
Hurry it up. I've got to get back before I'm missed.
Come on. If someone misses me at the party, we're both dead.
I need to lock the door behind you or the patrols might notice something's wrong.
You should just serve your time. Find an ore vein and start digging.
You're not in here for life, like I am.
I left behind my daughter Uaile when I was taken.
How old is my daughter now, I wonder? In prison, you lose track of time.
I'm just another Forsworn sent to rot here in this mine.
You need to not bother me.
You're talking to a killer, remember that.
You serve your time by digging. So dig.
Prison's not so bad. Less complaints when I kill people.
Cidhna Mine's for prisoner scum only. Keep out.
I'm in charge of the prisoners here.
No funny business. I'm watching you.
You do something out of line, I'll put you down.
Don't reach for a shiv around me, or we'll both regret it.
What do you want? Have digging to do.
Other prisoners get suspicious when we talk to each other, so keep it down.
Whenever I get out of here, I'm going to go kill a Nord.
I was sent here because someone said I was a Forsworn.
I'm innocent. The Nords framed me. I was nowhere near that murder weapon.
I wonder how grandma Bothela is doing. She's probably worried sick about me.
What do you want, new blood?
Jarl decided I was too much of a problem. Threw me in here with the Forsworn.
I got locked up one too many times. Now I'm in for life.
I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'm giving up thieving. Really.
You mess with the Silver-Blood family, you end up here.
I catch you stealing anything, I'll break your neck.
Now this is real guard duty. Just throw them in the mine and be done with it.
Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing.
Your job is to get into the party without being fingered as a spy. I'll take care of the rest.
Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you.
Don't plan on bringing anything else in with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously.
Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure to get it into the Embassy. The rest is up to you.
You ready yet? I need to get back before I'm missed. Remember, you won't have anything except what I smuggle in for you.
with nervous relief
with a frustrated sigh.
You can't go to a party at the Thalmor Embassy dressed like that.
Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?
she sounds like she might actually be worried about you
This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life.
Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!
Good. I have your invitation to the party.
But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest.
Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on.
You need to meet with him and give him whatever you think you can't live without while you're inside the embassy.
The Thalmor are paranoid and thorough. You won't get in the front door with anything but the clothes on your back.
When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back.
You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside.
Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over.
I'm telling you, this one is different...
We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.
It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!
Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!
Enchanting services are one of the few things that keep us in touch with the rest of Skyrim.
Perhaps we can go another few decades without a disaster. That would be nice.
I'm working on some very important research, I assure you.
The exact nature of my research is a secret, I'm afraid, but it really is quite valuable.
I don't think anyone here truly understands how useful my work will be.
When I've finished what I'm working on, everyone will understand its significance.
I have many important things on my mind. Your concerns are not among them.
Are you quite sure we need to be speaking?
I'm disappointed to say I've learned little during my time here.
I had hoped your scholars would be on a level comparable with my own colleagues. They are not.
We have survived difficult times, and are better mages for it. We owe you that, Arch-Mage. Thank you.
I wonder what we could've done with the Eye, had it been put to better use?
Have you seen Mirabelle around? I know she's dead, but I thought... Well, I thought she might stop in and say hello anyway.
You know, they say knowledge is its own reward.
Illusion really is the least appreciated of the schools of magic.
If only I could be free of the mundane, day-to-day activities life so often requires.
blurting it out, trying to get it over with as quickly as possible
Arch-Mage or not, my rules about books still stand.
All this knowledge might have been lost, were it not for you.
I don't want to see you treating any of these books poorly. Are we clear?
grumpy
You need a book, you talk to me. Otherwise you're going to find yourself in a lot of pain.
I don't care if you wrote it yourself -- if you want a book from here, you go through me.
The Arcanaeum is always accepting new volumes. I'll take what I can get.
We all have you to thank for saving the College. Your position is well-deserved.
Tolfdir as Master Wizard. Certainly didn't anticipate that.
And to think, Mirabelle questioned my allowing you into the College. I can just imagine the look on her face now.
If you need any help with Destruction spells, please let me know.
Mirabelle does a fine job as Master Wizard, I suppose. Still, there's always room for improvement.

nasty, mean-spirited

I'm sure when the time for promotions comes, they'll go to the most deserving mage.
flirty
Nasty business with that Ancano fellow. Pity that I was unable to assist, but I was... otherwise occupied.
I care little for idle conversation, but perhaps you need help with Conjuration magic?
There are few places where one can pursue my type of work without fear of persecution.
That 'incident' in Morthal was just a misunderstanding. No matter what the guards claim.
The people of Skyrim have no appreciation for what we do here. Not that I care.
Should you ever fall victim to an unfortunate accident, I promise your remains will be put to good use...
Why are my research materials constantly disappearing?
Once again, I have found very insulting notes left in my personal effects. Simply barbaric.
Just because I don't fit in here is no reason for others to ridicule me behind my back.
Ancano is exactly why we're so restrictive about access to the College. We'd all have perished if it weren't for you.
I'm sure you've made note of who's been the most helpful during your time here, Arch-Mage.
May I just say, it's a pleasure to have you leading the College. Really.
laying it on really thick
I think the College is due for a change in leadership.
If you're working on any experiments, please clean up after yourself.
Just like anywhere else, it's all about who you know. Lucky for you, you know me.
I hope I can count on you if I ever need a favor.
It's a small group of us here at the College. Favors don't go unremembered. Neither do affronts.
sucking up to the boss
I'm quite pleased that we're back to business as usual.
Certainly nothing illicit going on here, Arch-Mage. You can be quite sure of that.
Even with the College's laid-back attitude, there are still some things that are off-limits.
There are some experiments the College frowns on. If they're aware of them, of course.
If you ever need something, especially something hard to come by, let me know.
I've spent a long time building up a list of contacts for goods from all over Tamriel.
I am always available should you need me, Arch-Mage.
Like it or not, you are a shining example to future generations of College Mages.
It's always encouraging to see the younger generations embracing education.
The College will be here for you, no matter what. We always look after our own.
Education is never appreciated until after the fact. Young people never understand this.
Have you, by chance, seen my research notes? I seem to have misplaced them.
Another day, another opportunity to learn!
What you learn here will last you a lifetime. Several, if you're talented.
It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is... tainted.
Please don't do anything to anger the locals. They don't need additional reasons to hate us.
It is not the place of the College to become involved in local politics.
Someday the College may be fully accepted by the Nords. I hope that my work as Arch-Mage may help.
Please don't bother the Arch-Mage unless it's absolutely necessary.
If there are any problems, let me know. It's my job to keep things running smoothly.
Day-to-day operations are my responsibility, which means if you become a problem, you get sent to me.
Mine is not a popular position, but someone needs to keep things running smoothly around here.
Like it or not, this College is a direct influence on the public's impressions of magic and those that use it.
It is up to each of us to present ourselves publicly as maturely as possible, and to remain above petty local squabbles.
I still can't believe it. You, the Arch-Mage? Never would have guessed it.
You know, this is one of a very few places where you can receive a real education in the schools of magic.
I think my parents reserved a spot for me here at the College on the day I was born.
There's a lot of pressure for me to excel in my studies. I hope I can live up to expectations.
I never would have suspected that the Eye could be so dangerous. Tolfdir is right, isn't he? Magic really can overwhelm you.
I've certainly learned more here than I ever expected to.
I wonder if the College's reptuation will ever recover from our adventures.
The College is a bit of an oddity in Skyrim. Magic isn't something that's looked upon fondly here.
Nords don't trust magic, or those that use it. Made it difficult for me growing up.
They won't say much, but most people have very strong opinions about the College and those that study here.
Don't expect the local Nords to take kindly to you once they find out you're from the College.
Are the Arch-Mage's robes as comfortable as J'zargo believes them to be?
Skyrim couldn't be more different from Elsweyr. But magic... Magic's the same no matter where you go.
J'zargo will go wherever he can to learn more. Oblivion itself, if need be.
Khajiit are not known as mages, so J'zargo has much to prove.
J'zargo can learn magic from these men and elves, but they cannot learn to be as dashing as he. J'zargo comes out on top.
I think we could blow up half of Eastmarch, and people would still come to us for enchantments.
The local Nords may not like us very much, but they don't seem to mind having access to enchanted weapons and armor.
Savos doesn't care for politics. He likes to believe the College is removed from the rest of Skyrim.
If he could, Savos would float the the entire College above Skyrim, for all the Nords to see.
Greetings, Arch-Mage.
May I help you, Arch-Mage?
What was that you said, venomous wife of mine?
Nothing, you pig-headed oaf!
You survived! You have it, then?
Let's hope it's as powerful as the Psijics believe it to be.
Look around, see if you see anything unusual. Any signs of the mound being disturbed. Anything.
If my analysis is correct, the dragon buried near Kynesgrove will be the next to come back to life.
We need to find that burial mound before its dragon comes back to life.

Bring up some more mead, my boy. This cask's nearly tapped!
Yes, father. Which cask should we open?
Just bring any of them, lad! Can't risk thirsty customers without mead to drink, even for a second!
Any of them! Just hurry up! No time for a debate when customers are thirsty!
Bring the Blackbriar 195 Berry-Blend. It should be at its peak right now, and if it doesn't get served soon, it'll only go bad.
We just got a cask of Old Gold 200 that has a crack in it. Better serve it now before it goes bad.
Fat Toad 190 is always a crowd-pleaser. Father could probably charge extra.
Good idea, sis. Maybe you ought to be in charge!
Yes, yes, fine. Just hurry! Mustn't keep the customers thirsty!
It's been a good week, my boy! Loud customers mean good cheer, and good cheer means a full till!
You know, I ought to retire and leave you to run the Skeever, son!
I don't know, father... There's a whole world out there I want to see.
You'd just spend your time here, bossing me around and yelling for more drinks. You're practically retired already...
I could run the Skeever! You even said I'm almost as smart as you!
Why not let me run the Skeever? I already know lots about it!
Don't be a silly girl! Running a bar's no job for a young lady.

Viarmo, the college really must take a stand on the war!
Viarmo, don't you think it's time that the Bards College officially declared support for the empire?
Lady Ateia, it is the official position of the college to remain neutral in all political affairs. We cannot risk our history by choosing sides.
Now, now, our duty is to record the great tales of history, not to pick sides in them. Best to stay out of the warfare, I feel.
But I'm sure those Skyrim dogs would stand down if the keepers of the tales showed their patriotism!
Maybe if we stopped singing about their silly Nord heroes, the rebels would stop making such a fuss!
Aia, please be quiet. Viarmo and I are discussing matters of national politics.
Aia, this is a delicate matter. Why don't you review your lessons and be silent for a while.
Pantea, perhaps you should attend to your students, and leave the politics to me.
That is precisely why we remain neutral. Ours is to tell tales of empires, not to make or break them.
Tag! You're it!
I'm bored! Let's play a game!

Kharag, take a break and drink with me! Those trees aren't going anywhere!
Why so glum, my ugly friend? Did we run out of mead?
I have to work twice as hard because you drink up all our profits.
Can you pay attention to work for once, instead of your mug?
What did you say? I ought to break off one of those tusks and use it as my drinking horn!
Don't make me to defend the honor of my mead! It's been my friend a lot longer than you have!
Hjorunn, the last time you tried anything, your fist broke on my head!
Just as long as you don't breathe on me, Hjorunn. I'll be out for hours.
Guess we can't afford to miss that much work, can we? Oh well...
True enough, you cur. Back to work, I suppose...
Another gorgeous gray day, right dear?
It's too cold for my bones, but that never seems to stop you, dear.
I'm gonna go play soldier with a tree!
That's nice, son. Just don't stomp on the crop like last time!
I'll see if I can't get some work done inside, where it's warm.
Bassianus is still so terrified of Jofthor.
If he knew that I'd keep him from hunting the poor boy down, he'd take Fastred to Riften without a second thought.
Let him know that I'll watch out for them. I just want my daughter to be happy.
Have you spoken to my parents yet? Please, my love depends on it!
She would? If she's willing to deal with him, then everything would be all right.
I'll... I'll go speak to Fastred. Post-haste!
As do I. It's a puzzling situation.
I guess not.
That's the trouble. I know Faleen from the Keep, but I have no idea what sorts of things she likes.
It's not a simple matter. I could offend her fairly easily by bringing up the wrong subject. I've seen it happen before.

Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the fool? Is Cicero dead?
Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative!
But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she... Listener?
Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!
Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused... and they say I'm mad!
If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener?
So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!
Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it.
Then listen to this - don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother!
Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live!
So, what's the latest exciting news about goings-on in Winterhold?
There is no news, I'm afraid.
None? Nothing at all? Nothing from the College, even?
I shall inform you the moment something noteworthy happens.
Will you be needing anything special today?
Why don't you see if Arch-Mage Aren is interested in joining me for a meal?
Again? Are you sure? He still hasn't answered your last several requests.
Well, he's been very busy. Perhaps today he'll have some free time.
Malur, I need you to take care of something.
No, I don't think so. Not today.
I haven't even said what it is.
Doesn't really matter. Thanks, but no.
You must deliver those items to your superior. And I... I must get out of this foul place.
I don't even know what to think anymore...
Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!
I... knew Veren and Thorek. They were my friends.
Is this punishment for my past? Is it Mara's will to torment me so?
A servant offering a casual remark on what he does. No particular mood, very matter-of-fact.
Every night, I walk around the Gray Quarter and let them gray-skins know what I think of 'em.
We ought dig a big hole, throw all them dark elves and Argonians in it, and let 'em tear each other to pieces.
Only thing I hate worse than those scale-backs are them filthy gray-skins!
The Gray Quarter's a disgrace. Them dark elves live like animals.
Can't see why we let them dark elves live inside the walls. We should kick 'em out like we did to the scalebacks.
Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.
Skyrim isn't very friendly for Argonians, so we mostly just keep out of the way.
Shahvee knows the dock doesn't look nice, but fresh air is good for the gills.
Good honest work staves off the cold.
I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.
I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times.
When Grimvar asks me why women are being killed around the city. I don't even know what to say to him.
Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.
We can't thank you enough for helping us get this office running.
Hey, it's our hero! Seen any more of those pirates around here?
I appreciate everything you've done for us, but I really am quite busy.
To receive the blessing of Talos, you have only to pray at the altar.
Ulfric Stormcloak was a true hero of Skyrim. He stood up to the Thalmor and refused to turn his back on Talos.
The Stormcloaks are gone, but Talos will never be forgotten. I don't care what the Thalmor say!
You know about Talos? He founded the Empire!
We're the only Temple in Skyrim that can openly worship Talos.
Those awful Thalmor can't touch us, thanks to Ulfric.
I can't believe the Empire would turn its back on Talos.
Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milord?
Spare a coin for a poor old woman, milady?
Spare a coin? Talos rewards the generous.
I hope the wind dies down a bit before tonight. Hard when you've got to sleep outside.
Nervous being alone at night. Especially these days, with the Butcher prowling the streets.
Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.
These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.
You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.
Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen.
Come see me in the marketplace tomorrow. You won't find better prices in all of Eastmarch.
I don't haggle. If you want a lower price, look elsewhere.
I'd travel more, but who wants to deal with all the soldiers these days?
If you're looking to get a drink, Candlehearth Hall's got warm fires and strong ale.
Horses. All day long. Do you have any idea how dull horses are?
If the guards would listen to Viola, they'd have caught the Butcher by now.
I love my husband, but he can be a bit... dull at times.
Ugh. I'll need to bathe thoroughly to get this stench off of me.
Real Nords like to prove their mettle in the pit.
Just between you and me, I wouldn't mind if the Empire just up and left for good.
I'd love get one of those Imperial weasels under my boot...
I've been a bit out of sorts since... since our daughter was taken from us.
Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.
I try not to think of her, but sometimes the simplest thing will remind me.
No mother should have to bury her daughter.
This is the Hall of the Dead. Someday you'll end up here.
My job's simple enough. The dead don't really complain much.
Luckily Windhelm is cold, so the dead don't rot as quickly. Sometimes the burial has to wait for the ground to thaw, though.
Sarcastic, with mock enthusiasm.
Maybe you should just move along.
This here's Candlehearth Hall. Great room's upstairs, an' there's a bed for rent on the ground floor.
Got some fresh-baked bread an' good cheese, if you're after a bite to eat.
Mind you don't get fresh with Susanna. She plays the flirt, but it's just to get good tips.
Those Dark Elf refugees will take over the city if we aren't careful.
Be on the lookout. The Butcher could be around any corner!
Captain Lonely-Gale has been avoiding me, I just know it.
After what happened to those other women, I'm worried about my own safety.
Women murdered time and again, and all the guards care about is the war.
How can Elda hate the dark elves when she knows so little about them?
You didn't hear it from me, but if you want a real drink, try the Cornerclub in the Gray Quarter.
Did you know that candle on the mantle hasn't gone out in over a hundred years?
Stand away from me, or I'll crack you like an egg.
What are you looking at? Scared of strong women?
You look mighty tasty. Better not stick around for supper.
Working in Windhelm is great. I get to see Ulfric up close.
I never expected Ulfric to live up to his legend, but he does.
Ulfric was a true hero of Skyrim. He will be missed.
Remorseful
I couldn't ask for a better teacher than Oengul.
It's a new day in Windhelm. The Stormcloaks are gone, and so is their prejudice.
I wish the Nords, Argonians and dark elves in Windhelm got along better.
We Argonians do the work the Nords don't want to do.
The water is cold, but it's a lot better than having to work up in the dry air.
Shatter-Shield, East Empire Company... we'll work for any ship that pulls in, as long as they can pay.
The Nords don't appreciate us, but so what? I don't appreciate them right back.
Look, we don't have much love for your kind down here. Probably best if you just left.
Haven't seen you here before, egg brother. Welcome!
Haven't seen you here before, egg sister. Welcome!
The docks can be a dangerous place. Don't expect me to save you if you fall in.
Huh? What's that now? Leave me alone.
Another day, another septim.
The young folks are too happy to break their backs for the Nords. They forget what it was like to swim free.
Do you know my father? He's really important. He even talks to the Jarl sometimes.
Did you know my father? He was really important. He even talked to the Jarl sometimes.
All the Argonians at the docks are nice to me. Good thing, too, or father would run them off!
They say dragons are coming back. I want to kill one!
I made my fortune as a sea captain, but now I'm retired.
The townsfolk call me [QUOTE]captain[QUOTE] because I used to be a sailor.
I lost my family years ago. Truth is, I don't really know what keeps me going.
Did Viola send you to bother me?
Serving as Steward to Ulfric Stormcloak was a great honor, but I don't miss his temper.
I don't care that we lost, I'm just glad the war is over.
The Stormcloaks are finding victory across the land.
I'm not much of a strategist, but Lord Ulfric listens to my counsel all the same.
If you have any news of the western holds, take it to Ulfric immediately.
Terrible shame, what happened to those women.
I was one of the best soldiers in the Stormcloak army, until I took a sword through the chest.
I'd be out there fighting the Imperials right now if it wasn't for my war-wound.
Ever since that Imperial craven ran me through from behind, I've had trouble breathing. Don't have any trouble drinking though.
What? Were you hoping to claim this house for yourself? Well, the Aretinos always liked me, so I think I'm family enough to take up here.
The milk drinkers in this town wouldn't last five minutes in a real battle.
Rumor holds that the Aretino boy brought an assassin here. Sounds like nonsense to me.
I once killed six men, single-handed, while rescuing my brothers-in-arms from ambush by an Imperial patrol.
I'm not too proud to admit that I need a bit of help from time to time.
Can't say I mind the sight of all the Imperial guards. It's a change for the better.
All my goods are legitimate, which is more than I can say for some.
I like to share my good fortune with those who deserve it.
Trader dropped by recently with some lovely pieces, if you'd like to have a look.
Pardon the mess. We're really trying to do better around here.
[QUOTE]Windhelm's an easy posting![QUOTE] they said. Guess they didn't count on Ulfric's little uprising.
Can you believe the company won't even dock ships here anymore?
The conquering hero returns!
I really can't thank you enough for your help.
I still can't believe Isabella's gone. She was such a helpful young lass.
Now more than ever, the world needs tales of heroism.
I'll find some way to finish my book.
Know any tales of nobility and courage? I'm keen to record them.
first two sentences are sarcastic
Welcome, brother. Please, enjoy yourself.
Welcome, sister. Please, enjoy yourself.
Apparently some Nord women were murdered. Not sure why I should care.
At long last, Windhelm is free. No longer must we suffer persecution at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak.
Things have been a lot worse around here since Ulfric took over.
It's not the cold of Skyrim that gets to me. It's the stink from the people.
When I've made enough money, I'm going to return to Morrowind in high style.
Both my daughters. Now my wife? How much is one man supposed to take?
Poor Nilsine has been wrecked since her sister was killed.
Seeing a good tavern brawl might be just the thing to lift my spirits.
Brond's one of the most savage fighters I've ever seen...
What I lack in strength, I make up for with tenacity.
You need anything, come see me. I'm as resourceful as I am discreet.
I have a lot of respect for Ambarys Rendar, but his views are a little extreme.
You look like someone who appreciates nice things.
Oh, pardon me. Was I in your way?
I hope someday we'll get to know each other better.
I see why the Nords like Skyrim. This crisp air is wonderful for the lungs!
You seem like such a nice person. I'd love to hear more about you.
Can't believe Ulfric's gone. If not for Hermir, I'd have left the city by now.
Everyone says Eorlund Gray-Mane is the best smith in Skyrim. I plan to change a few minds about that.
Need some metal hammered?
Hermir's become a decent smith. Like to think I had a hand in that.
With my swords in their hands, Ulfric's men will send those legion dogs running.
I lost my twin sister a while back. Have you ever lost anyone close?
My father says we need to just get on with our lives. Like it's that easy.
I've been a lot of things in my life. Pit fighter's the one I'm best at.
We should get a dragon for the Pit. I'd love to fight one.
I've been fighting in the Pit for years. That should tell you something.
There's two kinds of Pit fighters -- good ones and dead ones.
Ulfric once tried to get me to fight for him, but marching bores me.
Steel. Barehanded. Armor. Naked. It's all fighting. I can kill you with a weapon or by myself. No difference.
With Ulfric dead and the Stormcloaks gone, who will have the courage to champion the cause of Talos?
I've spent my life serving Talos. I don't plan to stop now, no matter what the Empire says.
Talos created the Empire. You'd think they'd show him more respect.
The way I see it, Ulfric's fighting a holy war.
Someday all of Skyrim will worship Talos openly, as we do here.
Second sentence has an awkward, almost sing-songy flow to it. The shorter these are, the easier it becomes to avoid problems like that.
If Ulfric needs a favor, he has it. Anyone else better pay well for the service.
I'd explain my research, but you'd just be confused.
Said with sneering condescension.
My job? Well, I'm the Watcher of the Wheel! Which is... exactly what it sounds like. I watch the Wheel.
Watching the wheel isn't as simple as you might think. Have to inspect all the way around the ice, make sure it's not melting.
Don't get too many folks up here these days. Sometimes I think they've forgotten about me.
My time is limited, so speak quickly.
It'll take time to rebuild, but the Nords are no strangers to hard work.
The dark elves and Argonians won't soon forget Ulfric's prejudice, but I'm doing what I can to repair that rift.
Being a Jarl isn't something I ever wanted, but if I can help these people, then I will.
Got no time for a Nord who thinks he's better than everyone else. Keep walking.
I told you, I've got no patience for fools. Keep walking.
There's no glory in war. It's just something they tell soldiers so they'll risk their lives.
They call me a war hero. I'm no hero, I'm just a soldier who didn't want to die.
If Ulfric had his way, anyone who wasn't a Nord would be shipped right out of Skyrim.
The sooner this war ends, the sooner we can all get on with our lives.
Welcome to the House of Curiosities! I offer a brief tour for a few coins, or you can simply browse at your leisure.
If you've got some time, stop by my House of Curiosities. I promise you'll see wonders!
Welcome, friend, to Calixto's House of Curiosities!
My sister and I once traveled the world to assemble our collection. Such adventures we had!
I don't care much for the war one way or the other.
It bothers me that fewer people come to Windhelm these days.
Name's Nils. I'm the cook up at Candlehearth Hall.
Can't just throw the big logs on the fire. Got to have the little bits, too.
When I'm cutting wood, I pretend there's an Imperial soldier's head on the stump.
Hello, hello, hello. Interested in fighting in the Pit? The rules are strict, but if I don't see it, it didn't happen, know what I mean?
It's very important to Huki that all the battles are fair. What's more important to me is that my pay is fair.
Prove your valor in the Pit! If you haven't got any valor, prove your pocketbook!
When Ulfric was killed, justice was done. That might sound harsh, but it's how I feel.
I thought the the Gray Quarter would be a haven for my kind. I was wrong.
The Gray Quarter's not much to look at now, but it wasn't always so bad.
The cornerclub's been filling up at night lately. I'll bet Elda up at Candlehearth is jealous.
We might be poor, but is it really any better out there?
Not a day passes that I don't wonder if life would be better in Morrowind.
I don't see why we should live as an underclass to the Nords. If anything, they owe us.
Alchemy is simple. Unless, of course, you are simple. Then I can't help you.
Must you bother me now? I've almost figured out where it is.
My master can be a bit short-tempered, but I've learned so much from him.
I'll never have Master Nurelion's skill with potions.
I have a decent mind for potions, but I've also learned how to craft magical items.
I'm a sailor on the Northwind. We're laying over in Windhelm for awhile.
It's good to spend some time on solid land.
A life on the river makes for weak legs, so I do a lot of walking when we dock.
Captain Kjar expects the best, but he's a fair man. He never fails to reward hard work and loyalty.
Never much cared for Windhelm. The place is depressing.
I'm a lot happier out here on the deck than I am wandering around in that ruin of a city.
I heard those Forsworn out west live in caves. Can't be any worse than trying to live in Windhelm.
Can't wait until we raise anchor. Anytime the boat's not moving, I start to get impatient.
Sorry, but I'm not looking to hire any more crew right now.
You don't know what freedom really means until you've lived on the river.
Been on the river since I could walk. Wouldn't trade it for the world.
While you're on my boat, you follow my rules. First rule is, don't touch anything that doesn't belong to you.
The best way for us to win the Nords' respect is through hard work.
Too many dark elves in Windhelm complain about the way we're treated. What good does complaining do?
I'm proud of my farm. It takes no small effort to grow crops in this part of Skyrim.
I own Hollyfrost Farm outside the city. It's honest work, if a bit dull.
The Cruel-Seas have been sailors for generations. In truth, I regret not following in the footsteps of my ancestors.
If I make enough money from the farm, I'll buy myself a longship to sail the rivers of Skyrim.
I understand what potions do, but I don't always understand how they do it.
Said with a hint of warning.
If you're here to join the Stormcloaks, the palace is inside.
Loyal Nords are always welcome here. Anyone else better watch their step.
If you're an Imperial spy, better turn around right now.
Stay away from the Aretino Residence. The place is cursed.
You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf.
If you need an apothecary, the White Phial has respectable stock.
By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all.
The Dunmer get their drinks at the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Why they can't just call it a tavern is beyond me...
If it's bed or board you're after, Candlehearth Hall's got both.
Across the river to the northeast lies Yngol Barrow. Steer clear of that foul place, lest the walking dead claim you as their own.
The Eye of Talos was a fine ship, once. Now it lies wrecked, off an island just north of here.
Maybe you've seen masts sticking out of the water to the northeast? That would be the wreck of the Winter War. Fine vessel, back in its day.
South of here, and west of the road, lies Cronvangr Cave. Stay away from that cursed place, and the vampires that call it home.
Tell me you've seen them. Those... things. Small and evil, like something out of a nightmare. They come from Stillborn Cave, to the north. I know it.
I've no problem with your kind, Orc. But that stronghold you've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
I've no problem with Orcs. But that stronghold they've got in the southeast? Narzulbur? It's an affront to my people.
You hear the news? There's a dragon roosting up on Mount Anthor, to the northwest.

You have done well thus far, but trying times are ahead.
It is imperative that you return to your College at once.
You will be called on to take swift action. Rise to the challenge, and discover what you are capable of.
You are on the right path, and you will prevail.
So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?
Why, you don't think I could do it?
Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?
Yeah, why?
Take down that one with your bare hands too?
Troll's blood was he a tough one!
Actor makes [QUOTE]Pfft[QUOTE] noise.  As if saying [QUOTE]Pfft...yeah right![QUOTE]
But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!
What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!
I'm the Jarl's personal blacksmith, but that doesn't mean I can't sell you a few pieces for a fair price.
The Empire has always been good to the Orcs, but this war of theirs is none of my concern.
I served in the Legion with Thongvor Silver-Blood. He's a good man and a tough soldier.
I learned to forge when I was a pup, then I joined the Legion and mastered it.
calm, strong-but-silent
Traveling in the Reach is dangerous. You need a good carriage.
City of Markarth sure is a beauty. No doubt about that.
Stormcloaks took Markarth. It is good to see Talos worshipped openly again.
What can an old skald do for you, huh?
Songs are just old memories that help the mead go down quicker.
I've seen every corner of Skyrim, but nothing is as beautiful as the battlefield.
My father Kleppr is the one you want to talk to. I just clean up.
My mother and father yell a lot. Always have.
proud and noble
My daughter Adara is also my apprentice. She's a quick study.
Silver-Bloods tax everything now that they run the city.
Are you looking for a gift for a friend, perhaps? Or... a lover?
Perhaps a silver necklace or a silver ring? Easy to wear and soft against the skin.
I have a necklace that would look lovely on you, or on a... special someone.
My daughter Adara is going to be a fine silversmith when she's older.
Jewelry for sale. Redguard craftsmanship in every piece.
You there, uh, the finest silver in Markarth is sold right here.
Maybe you could buy a gift for a friend? A best friend?
I'm going to be a silversmith one day, like my mother and father.
Being an apprentice is great. I get to swing a hammer at things.
Mama doesn't like me jumping up and down in the house, but I can't help it. I swear.
Stormcloaks or Imperials. Either way, all they want is everything for free and you to lick their boots.
Hey you. Yeah, you. Fresh meat for your stomach.
Don't try to haggle with me. Buy or leave.
The secret to chopping meat is never washing your hands.
A man like me makes a lot of enemies. People are always trying to cheat me.
I paid extra for the biggest room in the Silver-Blood Inn. I need space to stretch these arms.
I am the Jarl of Markarth, now. The Silver-Blood family is finally where it should have always been.
Igmund was weak. We'll bring the order that the Empire should have.
Let the Forsworn ravage the Reach. Talos favors us. Our victory is assured.
The Silver-Blood family will be heard.
Jarl can refuse to see me all he likes. He can't ignore us forever.
Markarth lives because my family makes sure it's fed on gold and silver.
I'm Thongvor's steward now. Every coin in this city is ours.
We'll be sending generous resources to Ulfric. As much as the Reach can bleed.
Taxes. I love taxes.
Out of my way, kinsman.
Out of my way, outsider.
Bother someone else.
Didn't I speak clear enough? Out of my way.
Thongvor's made me his housecarl. Remember, me killing you is legal.
Keeping this place secure is as simple as breaking a few spines.
Used to have run-ins with the guards, now they have run-ins with me.
Outsiders. Pfft.
Blood and silver, friend. Blood and silver.
Just turn around and leave the city. That's the smart move.
My family owns this inn, but I've put Kleppr in charge. Right rat for the right job, I say.
I'm a busy man. Half this city works for my family, and I have to keep them in line.
Thongvor may be the head of the family, but I'm the hands.
We control every piece of this city. The people should be calling us kings.
If someone joins the Forsworn, we haul him to the mines.
Every prisoner in the Reach is just another worker for our family.
I'm married to Thonar Silver-Blood. Keep that in mind while you're speaking to me.
My husband Thonar handles all our family's business. He's an important man.
I married Thonar for the money, and I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit it.
I'm just a servant. Don't pay me any mind.
Working in the Treasury House isn't so bad. I earn good money.
Ildene has been working in the Treasury House since before I was born.
Sometimes I hear Yngvar singing in his room. He's actually quite good.
sounds a little bit like the wicked witch from Snow White
So the Stormcloaks took the Reach? Maybe Talos really is on their side.
Arnleif and Sons Trading Company buys and sells anything you wandering types need.
The selection seems small, but we can provide whatever you need. Just ask.
I love hearing Ogmund sing at the inn. He's a true skald.
With Lisbet gone, I'll be taking care of you.
Let me know if there's something you need to buy.
I'm keeping Arnleif and Sons going, as best I can.
Never thought I'd be running the store. I'm not used to it.
Lisbet handles the customers. I just check the shipments.
Feel free to take a look around the store.
I've been at Arnleif and Sons all my life. It's a good store.
I remember old Arnleif building each shelf in this store himself.
Old Arnleif would be proud of Lisbet. She's kept this place running, thick and thin.
I brought in my cousin Cosnach to help me handle shipments.
This is the Silver-Blood Inn. I'll let you figure out who owns it by yourself.
If I can't get you something, I'm sure my wife will bellow at me until I can.
Things are so much quieter with my darling Frabbi dead.
Unlike my husband Kleppr, I watch after our guests.
Now you just tell me if you need something.
You come right to me if you find an unwashed floor or lumpy bed.
I'll bend Kleppr's ear if there's anything wrong with a room you rent.
Isn't my son Hreinn such a good worker? Not like his father at all....
My worthless husband is gone, so I run the inn now.
I can't believe the mess Kleppr left things in. I have twice the work with him gone.
Don't mind the yelling. My parents are always going at each other.
I'm just here to clean up.
My father is more generous than he lets on. Gives me plenty of spending money.
The Hag's Cure is here for all your discreet needs...
I have potions for disease, love sickness, irritating children...
A little bit of old Reach magic can cure whatever ills you....
Oh yes... you'll need one of my special brews...
Not scared of an old woman now, are you?
I've taken over the Hag's Cure, since Bothela is gone.
I'm not sure if half these potions work. But they should. I think.
I wish Bothela was still running the store. I'm not ready for this.
I'm Bothela's assistant. She's the one you should talk to if you need an herb or a potion.
There's so much to learn about the shop. I'll never get it all straight.
Why can't the men in this city leave me alone?
Alms. I said [QUOTE]alms[QUOTE] you backbiter. Give a crippled worker a helping hand.
How about a septim? Wait, make that two septims, I feel like living it up.
Come on, you outsiders always have plenty of gold on you. Spare a piece!
They don't like us talking to people when we work.
Busy with the smelter.
Got metal to shape.
Just here to drink.
Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.
I spill just a bit of metal, and Mulush takes it out of my hide.
Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.
Drinks here are watered down, but they're cheap.
emphasize: [QUOTE]Worker gets out of line, I get him back IN line.[QUOTE]
These workers. Always complaining. Always excuses.
If a man has time to complain, he has time to work.
Shipment of silver this month is behind. Nepos is to blame, not me.
I tell Thonar I can only smelt what Nepos and his miners dig up.
Stormcloaks have taken the Reach, but we'll return. The Empire will bring order.
What do you want? Haven't you done enough damage to Markarth?
calm, level-headed
I can't believe we lost Markarth. Igmund's family has ruled there for generations.
I don't think we have anything to discuss, Stormcloak.
courteous
cautious
Igmund is alive, and I'll keep it that way, Jarl or not.
You lay one finger on Igmund, and I'll end you Stormcloak.
As his housecarl, Igmund's security is my chief concern.
Igmund's father was killed by Forsworn. I won't rest until they've paid with their blood.
Raerek is far too cautious, but I'll agree with him on any measure that keeps this city safe.
Need a new blade?
Got an axe here. Good for cleaving up Forsworn.
How about some armor?
You'll want some thick armor if you're traveling the Reach alone.
Don't bother with Tacitus. Useless.
You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not Tacitus.
I run the forge now. Kind of... scary.
Making weapons and armor isn't like making nails at all.
You need a sword? Uh, how about a small sword? Nail-sized?
I'm Ghorza's assistant. I help her with the forge.
Ghorza is the one you should ask if you need anything.
I'm not very good for anything more than smithing nails right now.
One time, I almost cut a finger off sharpening a blade. I hate blood.
I have things to study, what is it?
The artifacts I've discovered in Nchuand-Zel will make history one day.
I've only ever lost a few guards to Steam Centurions. Good odds, considering...
socially awkward
Oh, excuse me. With my uncle gone, things are a bit of a mess.
I'm not half the wizard my uncle was, but I still have a few spells worth buying.
Did you need something? A staff? Some enchanting materials?
I'm Calcelmo's nephew. I help him around the laboratory.
Don't let my uncle go on about his theories. You'll be here all night.
I'm afraid to touch half of the things we keep in the tower.
sighing.
Before you say anything, no, I am not from the Reach.
I have meals to cook for the entire castle and almost no help.
The Jarl gives me two incompetent assistants. Worthless.
I have to work, or Anton will rip my head off.
Anton sure looks like he's from the Reach, but don't tell him that.
Only reason Jarl keeps Anton on is because he cooks up a storm.
Don't mind the dogs, they get anxious when they haven't had dinner.
You should talk to Anton if you need anything. He's the master chef.
It's been a hard day cleaning. Good, honest work I say.
dry humor
Arkay's blessing to you.
You have the honor of addressing a member of the Thalmor. Bask in it.
The Dominion is here, and we're watching you.
The Thalmor know how to deal with Talos worshippers.
If you see any signs of Talos worship, it's your obligation to report them to me.
The Aldmeri Dominion is the only thing keeping the Empire on its feet.
This war is such nonsense. All this fuss over their false human god.
The Warrens isn't a place for your type. What do you want?
Warrens ain't for you. Trust me.
You don't want to be here. No one wants to.
Don't know anyone here doesn't have Rattles or Ataxia.
The Empire didn't think we could take the Reach, but here we are.
Let's see those Stormcloaks try to break into this canyon.
Outsiders aren't trusted in Markarth. Best keep that in mind.
Can't believe I'm posted here. Even the beds are made of stone.
You should see that Orc over in Understone Keep, have him forge you some new armor...
By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk. Best stop in at the Arnleif and Sons Trading Company, sell it off.
Let me guess - you need a drink. It's the Silver-Blood Inn you're looking for.
Break the law in Markarth, and it's off to Cidhna Mine with you.
Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up.
Lots of nasty holes in the Reach, and Blind Cliff Cave is one of them. A filthy Hagraven nest, northeast of here.
There's an evil to the north, friend, and its name is Ragnvald. A tomb like so many in Skyrim, where the dead have found no peace.
Travel southeast and you'll find an Orc stronghold, up around the old Dushnikh orichalcum mine.
Beware the region northeast, across the river. Forsworn have taken refuge in Broken Tower Redoubt and Red Eagle Redoubt.
There's a small skeever den just east of the city, at Reachwater Rock.
The Forsworn have been spotted to the north, near Bruca's Leap Redoubt.
Need a trained war dog? Fiercest companion money can buy.
I'll be handling the horses with Cedran gone. Miss that old man.
A war dog is good company and good protection.
I like the loyalty of a dog. Not as fickle as a wolf.
You have to train a good war dog from a pup. Bite your arm clean off otherwise.
Ondolemar is the commander of the Thalmor in Markarth.
Worship of Talos is strictly forbidden.
laughs after he says it. he's joking... or is he?
Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort.
Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out.
Let that be a lesson to you young pups. There is no challenge that magic cannot overcome.
Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he.
What? You think me too old, too feeble? There is more knowledge in me than in two of you pups put together. And knowledge... knowledge is my weapon.
Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning.
Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again...
When I am become wolf, I am treachery incarnate. And then, then... there is no one who can stand between the hunter and his prey.
When I first received the blessing of the wolf, my creator gave me a valuable piece of advice. [QUOTE]Arnbjorn,[QUOTE] he said. [QUOTE]Never lose![QUOTE] And I never do.
He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill.
It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death.
My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws.
In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise.
You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he.
I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest.
I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility.
In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality...
When one can divine the future, success may not be assured... but it can at least be anticipated. It helps that I've already foretold my own death.
Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of.
Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear.
Sometimes I just need to remind everyone why I'm the one in charge.
I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters.
Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale.
Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days...
It's good to see a fresh face. You wouldn't have happen to come from Whiterun would you?
Generally posting information is need to know only.
I... I've been trying to find the time and place to let her know.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
If you want to know that bad then fine.
I'm afraid that kind of thing doesn't work on Captains in the Imperial Army.
That's the way it is.
Yes, Sir. Although I'm not sure you'll be happy to know.
Her daughter was sent to Whiterun, the skirmishes there have been violent. The whiterun legate, he needed to know the Stormcloak positions.
He sent out a party to scout the area. They happened upon a large force... I'm told none of them made it back.
Private Morrard... Angela's daughter was in that scouting party. She needs to be told.
You got Aldis to tell you something? I knew you would. What did he say?
I told her. I told her the imperial army would kill her. That this was a war of Jarls and Imperial Generals and we had no part in it.
She just wouldn't hear it.
It was brave of you to come to me with this. I can't thank you for it, not for this, but you have done me a service.
If you've come to Solitude to join the Legion, speak to Rikke. If not, just keep your nose clean while you're here... or you'll end up like Roggvir.
He's the sorry bastard who's going to be executed.
A gate guard who let Ulfric Stormcloak escape the city, after he killed the High King.
There's no greater honor than to serve. If you're serious about enlisting, speak to Legate Rikke in Castle Dour.
The crucial nature is pure apparent. Mundane sight traded for another sort.
I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen...
It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!
Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend...
Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week...
Tell me, husband. Is it true what I've heard?
So, is it true?
I heard about what happened...
Tell me, brother. Are the stories true?
Tell me, sister. Are the stories true?
Your latest exploit certainly has the Sanctuary talking...
Come now. What everyone else is saying. It can't possibly be true...
You're referring to that blacksmith contract?
You must be talking about the caravan job...
Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it?
The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he.
The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours.
Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship...
Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard.
But to be outnumbered twenty to one...
You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one!
To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable.
It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty.
By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?
But really. A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else.
It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments.
I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea.
pleased and amazed
reserved but warm
Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.
Stand in the center of the room and prepare yourself to taste the Voice of the Greybeards.
Come inside. The other masters will meet us there.
First, Master Wulfgar will teach you the final word of Unrelenting Force. You are ready.
Wait, so... a costume? You're not serious...
Sure I am. We get some furs and tree branches, paint them white, and then tie them to Stump. Instant Frostbite Spider!
Frodnar... nobody is going to believe that your dog is a... Frostbite Spider. And if they do... they'll kill him. That's not much of a prank.
Oh yeah, and what would you rather do?
How about... we play tag! You're it!
Hey, no fair! Get her, Stump!
I'm getting out of here!
Those fools are actually fighting!
Hey! Watch what you're doing.
My money's on the big one.
Gods! Another fight.
Don't hurt me!
Please, someone do something!
Someone do something!
Somebody help!
A fight!
This should be good.
Get 'em! Kill 'em!
screaming
give a [QUOTE]hmph[QUOTE] at the beginning; emphasis on [QUOTE]is[QUOTE] - like you're talking/thinking to yourself at first.
You know what? You're not worth the hassle. Go... be some other guard's problem.
You speak to Burguk, chief of Dushnikh Yal.
You need steel? Speak to my forge-wife, Gharol.
Need a poison for your hunting? My mother, Murbul, knows several.
This stronghold respects strength, and strength alone.
Orc poisons are to be feared, if you wish to trade.
I have an old cure for Rockjoint. Common in little Orc children.
If you wish to trade, wait for the sun to rise.
I am Burguk's mother and wise woman to our tribe, outlander.
Malacath rewards the strong and punishes the weak.
Murbul knows many poisons and cures if you need them.
You should see Gharol if you're looking for a blade or armor.
I am the hunts-wife of this stronghold.
Burguk is a fine chief. He brings strength and wealth to the stronghold.
You wish to trade in Orc steel?
Strong gauntlets for strong hands.
Blades to kill your prey and your rivals.
We can trade when there's light outside.
I'm Burguk's forge-wife. I shape all the steel for the stronghold.
As forge-wife, I'm also in charge of our mine.
I am Burguk's favored wife. He knows my beauty should be praised.
Arob and Gharol eye me with envy. They don't know how to please their chief.
Umurn and Nagrub will be held up as weak next to the son I will one day bear for my chief.
I work the forge, with my mother Gharol. We mine our own ore and shape our own metal.
One day I will shape a weapon fit for a chief. Maybe that chief will be me.
I help in the mines as well as the forge.
One day, I must fight my brother Nagrub for chiefdom. It will not be easy.
I help my mother Arob with the hunt. We bring much meat and skins to the stronghold.
Brother Umurn is a strong warrior. I look forward to fighting him for chiefdom one day.
One day, I intend to be chief. I will fight my father and my brother for it, as is tradition.
I serve my chief and my brothers by working in the mines. It's the only place fit for an aging Orc.
Sorry, outlander, but this old Orc cannot help you. Burguk is the chief here.
I don't know how Ghorbash has so much spirit. He should act his age.
I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.
We honor the bravest fighters, but I have seen many types of bravery in my travels.
I am an Orc and a warrior, but I have no desire to become chief.
Tell me, mother, does Malacath favor our stronghold?
He is pleased. Ours is the strongest tribe in all the Reach.
I saw you working the forge today, wife. Your muscles have grown strong from the metal shaping!
Do they, my chief? Am I now favored enough to replace Shel by your side at the feast? Back your words with action!
No more talk of Shel. As chief, I will do what I please, so point your fiery gaze to our enemies.
My chief, Gharol threatens to have me work in the mines. You won't allow my pretty hands to dirty, will you?
No, my wife. You have been given other gifts to please your chief than mine work. I will talk to Gharol and all will be well.
Oh, thank you my chief!
It is a fine day to work the mines.
This metal will serve the forge well, my brother.
You could challenge Burguk, my brother. Yours is the stronger swordarm.
Serving in the Legion taught me to respect leadership. The stronghold needs Burguk.
The air has the smell of beasts. The hunt is good today.
Yes, mother. I'm eager to prove my skills today.
Ah, the air is good today. I welcome the smell of blood from all the kills I will make.
Patience, my son. The hunter days not welcome the blood of his prey, he waits for it.
You are speaking to Larak, chief of Mor Khazgur.
You should see my forge-wife, Shuftharz, if you need weapons or armor.
My mother, Sharamph, knows many remedies you may wish to take with you.
I'm a strict follower of the old traditions. Honor, strength, deeds.
My place is chief and my challenge is to lead my people.
I have poisons for your weapons, and cures for your ills.
Poisons can kill your enemies faster than any blade.
Do not allow Ataxia to fester. A smart warrior keeps a potion to cure diseases at all times.
If you wish to trade, see me during daylight.
I am wise woman to this stronghold.
Our chief is strong. That is all that matters.
You should see my mother, Sharamph, if you need a cure or a poison.
Shuftharz can forge you some armor, outlander.
Malacath protect you.
Larak is strong, but he has much to prove as chief.
You need some armor, outlander?
How about an axe? Malacath smiles on the axe-wielder.
We can trade in the morning, outlander.
The forge is strong and so is our chief, Larak. I'm content.
My son, Olur, learns the forge well. His work brings me pride.
I envy you, outlander. You can choose to leave if you wish.
Soon, I will be of age. The taste is bitter.
Perhaps I'll join the Legion one day, as my father had done.
I work in the forge and the mines. Mother says it pleases her and our people.
Even good hammers warp metal if struck without care.
Mother tells me to shape metal with focus and strength.
Malacath is pleased with your strength, Larak.
I am honored.
The way you and your mother forge weapons is impressive.
It's simple Orc smithing practice, my chief. Nothing that hasn't been passed down for years.
Thank you, my chief.
Your muscles ripple when you work the forge. It's pleasing.
Damn shame, Roggvir. You were a good man.
That makes Twenty-Three.
Whispered
I'm going to find whoever did this.
Kynareth preserve us.
matter-of-fact
Agh! Dead body!
Poor bastard's better off.
What a waste.
Another corpse for the pile.
Such a shame.
Damn shame.
Dead? Oh my goodness!
Shouldn't leave things around to trip over...
Oh my word, this is terrible.
Agh! Who did this?
Another poor soul lost.
Dead? How did this happen?
Oh... what happened?
Dragonborn!
Shor's blood, the Thu'um!
Are you Dragonborn?
By the gods, is that the Voice?
That must be the Voice!
What in Arkay's name was that?
That sound... it's deafening!
Could that be... the Voice?
Those words have such power!
What sort of power was that?
That was amazing!
The Voice? Here?
That sound could bring mountains down!
You have a mighty voice!
That voice is power!
Louder than the roar of the Mane, that is!
S'rendarr's mercy!
Are you a Greybeard?
Did anyone else hear that?
By the gods, my ears...
That gave me the shivers!
Now that's a real man!
Oh gods, my ears!
Not so loud!
I haven't heard a true shout in generations!
Now that's the true Voice!
How did you do that?
Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?
Give me a reason to try.
quoting someone else while angry
It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.
sarcastic complement
Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.
Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.
Did you forget the Oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?
Weapon drawing, furious.
I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence.
But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.
sarcastic chuckle before line
Standing over Player who is dying
Shhh. Listen to Enthir... we can't afford to miss a single detail.
We haven't much time for discussion, but what did you need?
Let's listen to Enthir's translation before we decide what we do.
Please, there isn't much time. What is it?
Please, make it brief. We have much to do.
Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?
Was there something else?
Can I help you with anything else?
Ah yes, my matchmaker. What is it I can do for you?
Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important.
I've already provided you with the key to my museum, what else could you possibly want?
What is it this time?
This better be important.
Surprised, to self aloud.
Do you have Gallus's Journal?
A problem? Let me see it.
This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good.
He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.
No. However, I know someone who might.
The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated.
A word of warning. Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.
full of self
By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of the Jarl.
Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little rebellion of theirs once and for all.
The rebels have agreed to cease hostilities until we hash out this treaty. Suffice it to say I'm not holding my breath.
For the moment we have ceased hostilities. We'll see what these Imperials have to say. I doubt we'll come to any lasting agreement.
Things are quiet for the moment. That won't last long. As soon as a new campaign starts, I want you there. Stay close. See me tomorrow.
The gods have granted us peace for the moment. But that won't last long. I'm sure trouble will be stirred up soon enough.
Of course. But why not let him go in first?
Of course. But why not let her go in first?
They may be cowards, but I'm not. I'll go with you.
Lead on.
I suppose you're right. I'm not a fighting man.
Go, and avenge my Laelette for me.
sizing you up
amused at your surprise but bitter that she's so easily taken for a non-entity
Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial near there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.
That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.
Come on. Let's go see if there's a mythical dragon buried up there.
We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn.
stunned into speechlessness - quiet, reflective
So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me.
It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are.
seriously considering whether or not to kill you right now
You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.
We remember what most don't - that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer.
You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul.
The dragonstone was a map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
It seems to be spreading from the southeast, down in the Jeralls near Riften. The one at Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.
You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?
the Shout he's using to resurrect the dragon Sahloknir. Maximum intensity. Enunciate each word -- almost pausing between them.
There's no time to waste. Let's go.
Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn.
with a flash of anger
But I had to know if the rumors about you were true...
emphasis on [QUOTE]they're coming back to life[QUOTE] -- this is new and surprising information that she's telling you
They weren't gone somewhere for all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors.
Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.
I know they are. I've visited their ancient burial mounds and found them empty.
And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life.
We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
You'll be back. If you're really Dragonborn, this is your destiny.
Come on. We've got to get to Kynesgrove.
That mound you remembered sounds like what we're looking for. East of Kynesgrove, right?
I don't know exactly. We need to find the ancient burial mound. Let's ask around town.
I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we had a heart like yours among our numbers.
That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us.
You are due more honor than some calls and feasting.
We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted.
He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How can something that gives this kind of prowess be a curse?
So we take matters into our own hands.
He was one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother.
Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies.
You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.
There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock.
The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before.
We're going to slaughter them. All of them.
Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead.
To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf.
All right. If I make it back to Windhelm, I'll make sure Ulfric knows how you helped me.
Keep an eye out for Imperials. They still hold this entire region. As long as we don't do anything stupid... we should be all right.
Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus.
He's the world's master of the nature of Elder Scrolls, but... well.
He's been gone for a long while. Too long.
Come closer. Bask in my presence.
I am Hermaeus Mora. I am the guardian of the unseen, and knower of the unknown. I have been watching you, mortal.
Most impressive.
Your continuing aid to Septimus renders him increasingly obsolete. He has served me well, but his time is nearing its end.
Once that infernal lockbox is opened, he will have exhausted his usefulness to me.
When that time comes, you shall take his place as my emissary. What say you?
Indeed. Speak with me when the box has been opened, and all shall be revealed.
Be warned. Many have thought as you do. I have broken them all. You shall not evade me forever.
Go forth. Do the biddings of Septimus, for he is working my will in your plane.
What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous....
Come, my champion.
Now you have my Oghma Infinium. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarses, my loyal servant.
For hundreds of years it's been shut away from the world. Septimus was a useful tool for unleashing it.
Now it is in your hands. Let us work wonders together...
Eirid and I are playing Hunt the Elf. It's my job to find the Elf, and kill it dead.
Have you seen it?
All right!
Fine, Elf-Lover. I'll find her myself.
I'll find that Elf. I always do.
playing game, trying to sound big and mean
Ha! Found you!
I hate this game.
I understand Eirid's been playing [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] again.
It's just children playing, Haran. I wouldn't fret over it.
I'm not [QUOTE]fretting.[QUOTE] I don't want Eirid playing those sorts of games!
All right, all right. I'll speak to her.
I understand Korir's been complaining about our customers again.
What of it? It's our Inn, and they cause him no harm.
I believe he was suggesting their presence causes him harm.
Well, then he's welcome to eat and drink at home, isn't he?
Well, isn't this a surprise!
How much of our money have you spent today, Ranmir? Anything left, or is it all gone?
If I wanted to get yelled at, I'd be home. Can't you leave me be?
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? Am I making your life more difficult?
Please, come home. Just... Just come home.
Can't. Got at least two rounds to go.
Why don't you go... sell something.
Why? Because I'd rather be here trying to keep my only brother from drinking himself to death.
Ha! Drink ain't gonna kill me. Not today, anyway.
Is everything well, Nelacar?
Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need.
hesitant
Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then.
I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand.
I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?
surprised, laughing
realized question wasn't a joke, suddenly suspicious
No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences.
Oh, certainly I hope not! That would be quite unfortunate for my research.
with despair and weariness
with astonished relief, almost giddiness
Oh, yes. It's all been foretold. The end has begun. Alduin has returned.
Only a Dragonborn can stop him. But no Dragonborn has been known for centuries.
It seems that the gods have grown tired of us. They've left us to our fate, as the plaything of Alduin the World-Eater.
searching wildly around his home, throwing papers on the floor, etc.
Are we running low on mead?
No, without Ranmir around we're running out of stock far less often than we used to.
Let's just keep an eye on the supply. It's such a chore to restock.
How long are we going to let Ranmir drink himself into a stupor? When will enough be enough?
As long as he keeps paying, I suppose. He keeps to himself, and isn't hurting anyone.
Are you so sure of that? I think Birna might disagree with you.
It's not my place to get involved in their family's business, remember? You're the one that told me to stay out of it.
Good morning, Assur. What do you want to do today?
mean, snotty
upset, whiny
Too bad. That's what we're playing, and you're the Elf. Now go hide so I can hunt you!
pouting
distracted
Come in, come in. Mustn't speak of these things in the Ratway.
You... Dragonborn? Is it really true?
shakes head sadly at her refusal to face the facts
Divines sake, Skald. Who do think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers, anymore.
So you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you.
Stop. Turn around. And go back the way you came. Astrid is waiting for you. She's down near the entrance. You must have passed right by her.
You work hard, Daighre. Glad you have stayed with us.
I'm grateful, Skaggi. I'm sorry my daughter gives you so much trouble.
Skaggi tells me that you were bothering him today. Can't you and Torom just play by yourselves?
But mom, it's so boring with just me and Torom. I was just asking Skaggi some questions.
You leave him alone. I don't want to hear Skaggi telling me you've been bothering him again!
Yes, ma'am.
Mining out this old rock is a lot quieter, now. Thank the Divines.
Hard to believe there'd be an old crypt underneath the mine.
We're getting back to work as best we can.
It's crazy to still be working here. What if there's more draugr down there?
This mine will be our grave yet. I just know it.
Any day now more draugr are going to come out of that crypt.
We tunneled into an old crypt. We're warning strangers to keep out.
I'm not going into the mine with draugr lurking down there.
Guards are useless. They just stand around waiting for a full regiment to come and help.
We're keeping the mine closed until that crypt is clear.
I hear talk about a regiment coming to clear the crypt out. We'll see if that happens.
There's still plenty of ore left in that mine. What a waste.
Mine's closed. Move along.
This is the last hagraven between us and my mother!
Greetings, mother.
Daughter. Who is this you have brought me?
Sneaky - you're leaving out that the subject will be killed.
You're shifting your attention to the player after [QUOTE]Splendid[QUOTE]  Polite but not friendly.
[QUOTE]Subject[QUOTE] like it's an amusing term to you (because you are about to kill him)
I can't let you do this, mother. You have to die now!
I'm still busy, but I can always make time to speak with you.
Always a pleasure. What brings you back?
Any luck locating those jazbay grapes?
This place is boring. Nothing but the same thing every day. Sigh.
I wish I could head to one of the capital cities... maybe even back to Mournhold. Anywhere but here.
One day I hope to become a painter, but at this rate it looks like it's never going to happen.
Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to set what you see on a canvas so you'd have that memory forever?
My sister keeps telling me that the farm keeps us alive, but I don't really call this living.
Aduri, how come the fields haven't been tilled like I asked?
Boring? That food is paying for everything. If we lose even a single crop, we could starve or be forced to beg. I won't have it!
Have you decided if I can head up to Solitude yet? I hear it's the best place to meet someone who may be willing to teach me to paint.
you're sorry you can't let your daughter do what she wants
It's not going to be next year, nor the year after that! You just care about this farm more than you care about me!
Painting won't put food on the table, but our crops will. Be patient Aduri... it will happen someday, I promise.
Thanks for the help. Not many willing to take on the Forsworn these days.
Stand next to me, and prepare your Whirlwind Sprint. Master Borri will give the signal.
Follow me. Master Borri will test your Whirlwind Sprint.
We will do your next test in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
slightly disapproving
You must feel the Word within yourself.
You learn quickly, as only a Dragonborn can.
Master Borri is waiting.
Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons also are able to absorb the power of their slain brethren.
A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries.
What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve.
Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready.
sternly, disapproving
Despite what you discovered it's still comforting to know my husband is at peace.
So, any luck finding my louse of a husband?
Hmph. If you see my good-for-nothing husband Leifnarr on your journeys tell him he's no longer welcome here.
Men are utter pigs... they only care about one thing.
You men are utter pigs... you only care about one thing.
Men are complete pigs, am I right? All they care about is one thing... and you know exactly what I mean.
If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless.
I can't believe my mother's gone. Now what'll I do?
I knew it! I knew my father was a hero and he didn't just run away.
It's just me and my mother at the mill here. My father is gone. We don't know what happened to him.
I hope you're not here to start some trouble. I'll fight you if I have to.
My mother taught me the millwork trade... you know, which trees to cut and which ones to pass up.
Someday I'll take over the mill... when I'm old enough.
acting tough
Millwork sure is boring, but at least I don't have to work in a nasty mine.
yelling at your daughter
I'm sorry mother, now that he's dead, I just want to know everything I can about him.
I'm sorry mother, I just want to know more about him. You never tell me anything!
He was a wonderful man, and he loved us very much. I'm sorry I yelled at you.
That's because there's nothing to tell. He left us to fend for ourselves and that's all you need to know.
It's okay, mother. I understand.
I wish you didn't hate him so much... I wish the whole family could be together again.
Mother, I finished cutting at the northern stand. Where do I move on to now?
There is a copse of elms to the east. We could really use that wood.
I was hoping to head into Riften for supplies, but I can do that after I'm done with the elms.
Just be careful, Gralnach. That copse doesn't look safe. If you see any trouble, you run right home.
Thanks again for getting my bow back from those thieves. Next time they come knocking I'll be ready.
So, has my bow turned up yet?
act startled - in a bad way
act startled
You even think of taking something from my house... and I'll kill you.
Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you.
After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place.
You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.
The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.
Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected.
I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.
Synda... you left your dagger behind again yesterday. I told you, the road isn't safe.
Husband, you worry far too much. We are within an hour's walk of Riften.
That doesn't matter. All it would take is a stray wolf or a bandit crossing your path... I can't bare to lose you after everything we've done.
If it puts your mind at ease, I'll take it with me. I'm sorry.
Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?
I can't stand them, they represent everything I hate about Skyrim. They're tearing the place apart!
All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.
Sorry, Marise. I just can't sit back and watch them treat us like a resource. This is our home!
I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.
Maybe we could invite some of those nice guards over. You know, for some supper?
No. I have enough trouble without more mouths to feed! They're the Jarl's men, they can eat supper at the keep.
Terrible. Only a matter of time before soldiers come and burn all my hard work into dust!
How do you think the crops are coming, dear?
Look at the sky. Be a terrible day tomorrow. I know it.
Oh, Rogatus! Maybe tomorrow will be pleasant for once, hmm? It can't be terrible every day!
Yes it can. I haven't been wrong in 50 years, and I won't be wrong tomorrow.
Are you all right, Gat?
Still shaken from all the fighting, my friend. It's been too long since I had to kill someone.
I try to think of it as coaxing the ore from the rock.
I keep hearing stories about Morrowind. Sounds like a wretched place.
I hear there's baked slaughterfish tonight.
What's your trouble? Dasturn telling tales again?
We keep hearing that the war could come through here. I try not to worry about it.
It's tough to keep track of Hrefna. If her father wasn't such a snowback, he'd be around to help out.
I'm not proud of Hrefna's father. If she knew him, she wouldn't be either.
Hi! I've never seen you around here before. Are you a miner too?
Sondas takes care of me when mom's not around.
Derkeethus used to take me diving way down deep in the river. I miss him.
Mom says the Empire is mean, but I don't think they're that bad.
The Stormcloaks are named after Ulfric. He's a bad man, but don't tell the soldiers that.
A traveler? I'll be you've seen some sights. We should swap tales sometime.
There's a gorgeous tree that grows right up through a cave to the northeast of here.
If you're heading to Kynesgrove, stick to the road. Some pretty dangerous caves between here and there.
Verner used to love exploring before we got married. Now he's become a bit of a milk drinker. Likes to stay home.
If you head straight west from where the White River splits towards Whiterun, you can get a look at the Cradlecrush giants.
You looking for work? We could use an extra hand in the mine. Just bring me any Corundum you dig up.
Annekke used to help more with the mining, but nowadays she's a bit of a bounder.
I do love my wife. Just wish she'd get her head out of the clouds.
If you want some information about the area, Annekke knows it better than anyone.
Sometimes I feel like Annekke cares more about finding new rocks than being with me.
Did you see the fires from Goldenglow Estate? I was afraid the whole place was going to burn to the ground!
If you're looking to purchase goods, I have none to sell. You should head into Riften instead.
Pretty quiet out here on the farm. My wife and I kind of like the solitude.
Vulwulf has been quite generous to let me take care of their farm considering I am not part of their family.
The Snow-Shod's are very trusting to let me run this place without their supervision.
I'm glad there are guards outside the farm. I don't think I could defend the place alone.
My husband and I were just recently married.
I'm originally from Cyrodiil, but I left there after I had a falling out with my family.
This was the first door in Skyrim I knocked upon, and little did I know my future husband would be answering the door.
I like the farm life. It's a huge change from living in a city.
Addvild's made me a happy woman. I wouldn't want to be with anyone else in the world.
Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn.
You show promise. Remain focused, and you will fulfill your potential.
You have the ability, but you need to learn discpline if you wish to fulfill your potential.
We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout.
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Word.
Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.
Try it again. Breath and focus.
Is this your best effort? Again.
Come, Dragonborn. Attend to Master Borri.
aloof, somewhat distrustful
You are now ready for your last trial.
Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav.
Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return.
Masters Einarth, Borri, and Wulfgar will each demonstrate a Shout. Make your choice.
Don't worry, though. You will find all three Words in Ustengrav.
[QUOTE]breath[QUOTE] not [QUOTE]breathe[QUOTE]. this is supposed to be sort of a saying of the Greybeards.
Master Borri has agreed to teach you the first Word of a new Shout. Attend to him.
Use both words, if you can.
Use both Fus and Ro. Together, they will make the Shout more powerful.
Well done. Again.
You learn quickly. Once more.
That's it. One more time.
Word of power, means [QUOTE]open![QUOTE]
Come, we will do your next test inside the hall.
Without training, you have already taken the first steps towards projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout.
Now let us see if you are willing and able to learn.
Master Einarth will now teach you [QUOTE]Ro,[QUOTE] the second Word in Unrelenting Force.
First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?
You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper.
Understood... husband?
Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil.
uncharacteristically nice
Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.
But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?
Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.
whispering to himself
We will see if you truly have the gift.
Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
Everything well, Jesper?
Yes sir, fine sir.
Good, good. Keep up the hard work. It'll all pay off.
Is everything well with you, my scaly friend?
Teeba-Ei is cold, but Teeba-Ei works hard as always.
Yes, well... That's all we ask of you. Carry on.
How goes it, son?
I'm fine, father. Work is fine.
Good, good. It's honest work, son. No shame in that.
Of course not. I never thought otherwise.
Right. Well, you let me know if you need anything.
I'm going to Movarth's Lair to kill that monster. Are you with me?
Take us to Movarth's Lair!
Take us!
Kill the vampire!
Kill him!
Let's kill him!
Destroy him!
I want vengeance for my wife!
Vengeance for Laelette!
We're marching on Movarth's Lair whether you come with us or not.
Um...this place looks dangerous.
Yeah. Kind of scary too.
And it's full of vampires?
Morthal is full of cowards! Let's go kill that monster.
Cowards! We must kill the vampires. We have to make them pay!
Let's make sure we're just as productive this month as we were last. If Bryling's happy, we're happy.
Yes sir, of course.
All right. Keep up the good work.
I just don't understand what kind of a man does that.
I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards.
Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?
Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions.
Oh, what is this? A visitor? To our farm? Oh, do stay for a while, dear.
kindly grandmothering
grumpy old man
Oh, wipe that frown off your face Rogatus. You've been wearing that frown for over 50 years now.
You want me to smile? What's there to smile about? Soldiers and dragons are going to be trampling all over the crops this year. I just know it.
Oh, stop being such a grouch! Not every visitor to the farm wants to burn it down! Maybe they just want to have a nice supper with us, hmm?
You don't invite monsters into your home to have supper! I won't have them here, and I'm certainly not smiling for them!
Kolskeggr, overrun with Forsworn, what next?
Did you hear that? Pavo was driven out of his mine. Almost everyone is dead.
What if the Forsworn come here? We aren't safe.
You should speak with my husband. Skaggi runs everything.
I'm just here to mine.
Got ore to dig.
I'm one of miners. Plenty of ore to dig up around here.
Don't have much to say to you. Got work.
It's amazing how much work goes into the little things, isn't it?
I'm just here to dig. Not much else to talk about.
Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone.
Don't go to Kolskeggr. It's not safe.
Gat and I are the only survivors.
Pavo and I had to fight our way out of Kolskeggr. Forsworn killed everyone else.
Thank Malacath we got out of Kolskeggr alive.
Don't know what I would have done without Pavo. Man's braver than he admits.
Poor Pavo and Gat. To have lived through a Forsworn attack.
Another day, another settlement gets attacked. No place in the Reach is safe from the Forsworn.
I'm the hardest worker in Left Hand. Better than any man.
Most women would rather die than dig, but I have a daughter to raise.
My Erith has her father's eyes. She's all I have left of him.

By the Eight, I didn't think you could do it!
Now maybe we can put all this behind us.
Take this as a token of our gratitude.
The god Arkay was once like us, bound to winding mortality.
But he willingly gave up this existence that we might better understand the vagaries of life and death.
It is through the ebb and flow of this cosmic tide that we find renewal and, in the end, peace.
May the spirit of Lavinia and all those who have left this world and its suffering know the beloved serenity of Aetherius...
... and may we one day rejoin them in eternity.
Do you not know the Daedric Lord of the Hunt?
He revels in the chase, and also gave the [QUOTE]gift[QUOTE] of lycanthropy to mortals.
A powerful force, not to be crossed. As I learned too late.
With those three vessels, Hevnoraak can restore himself. Find them before he can.
Kill him now, while we still can!
Did you find all of the vessels?
Do not interrupt the ritual. Go empty the vessels and sit on the throne.
Hevnoraak is defeated.
Thank you, hero. Now I may finally rest. Take Hevnoraak's iron mask. It may be of use to you, and serve as some reward for your feat here.
Boy, did you miss all the excitement.
There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well-placed spell.
You like creepin' around in the shadows? Magic'll work just as good there as anywhere else.
sinister laugh
Talk to Babette about potions. She's the creepy little girl - can't miss her.
Yes, yes. I'm your brother and I'm supposed to greet you respectfully. So [QUOTE]hello.[QUOTE] There, satisfied?
I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.
Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl.
It's been quite a boon, looking like a child. No one ever suspects a thing.
My targets make the mistake of not perceiving me as a threat. Last mistake they ever make.
I could brew some potions for you. Or train you in Alchemy.
You looking to buy some potions? Or maybe I could help train you to make your own?
Let me guess - Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband? She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she plays favorites.
What do you want, beef roast?
You're part of a family now, hamshank. I trust you... you trust me. Got it?
laughs after he says it
Hello, tidbit.
It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects.
Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end.
In the Dark Brotherhood, I found acceptance, love, and my life's true purpose.
Death is but the time to sleep forever, in the Void.
Sithis' whisper be upon you, brother.
Sithis' whisper be upon you, sister.
It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Owww...
Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?
Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am a Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow.
I serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. Life is simple, and good.
The Shadowscales are all but forgotten. An ancient tradition, from another time.
Greetings, brother.
Greetings, sister.
Oh, hello hello!
You require the services of the Fool of Hearts?
Greetings, Listener!
How may I serve the Listener?
Brother.
Sister.
If you bring mead, you're welcome here! Even if you don't, you're still welcome!
All this talk of dragons is making people antsy. Nonsense!
I visited the meaderies of Riften once, as a lad. Wish I had their skill.
Working our mine is dangerous work, but Dravynea keeps it going. Well, Dravynea and the promise of more mead.
You've got a fine look about you. Come have a visit at the Braidwood Inn. Better than home!
Welcome to Kynesgrove. If you want to do business here, you'll have to deal with me.
If it's malachite you're after, you've come to the right place. I'll pay for any you dig up out of Steamscorch Mine.
Kjeld speaks for Kynesgrove. Anyone who says otherwise is aching for a fight.
[QUOTE]Roggi[QUOTE] rhymes with [QUOTE]old fogey[QUOTE]
My wife is a good woman, but every man needs a little variety, you know?
An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.
The mine's always on the verge of collapse. Good thing I'm around to keep it up.
Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days.
Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Roggi's the only one around here even half-decent.
I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.
Seen the remnants of the grove? That... well, that was me. Me and my sister.
Came here to start a lumber mill. Who knew the Nords cared about a bunch of old trees?
But... well, they did. Sacred, they said. So we work the mines until we've worked it off. Fair enough, I guess.
Oh, great, another wanderer. Slumming it on your way to Windhelm?
Wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my idiot sister.
I can't believe she dragged me all the way to this snowball. I'd rather be broke in Cyrodiil than broke here.
If these Nords don't let up soon, I might just make a break for it. At least Cyrodiil is warmer than this.
Did you see my husband already? I'm sorry... he can come off a bit rough at times.
I hope you'll stay for a bit. We could certainly use the business.
This is really quite a nice town when you get down to it. Just look at the view!
Got some nice comfy beds at the Braidwood Inn, if you're looking to flop down somewhere.
I've never seen you before. Leave me alone!
My pa runs this town, and you're going to be in big trouble if you mess with me.
You don't look so tough. I'll bet I could take you.
Why are you still here?
Yamarz was a fool. Always trying to scheme his way out of responsibility.
Well, the giants took care of him, and you took care of the giants. Two problems solved at once.
But, you took care of him and the giants. Two problems solved at once.
Now, take Shagrol's hammer back to Largashbur, and we'll see about whipping the rest of them into shape.
The Old Hroldan Inn is still open, bless poor Eydis's memory.
Skuli owns the inn with his mother gone, but I handle the rooms.
You should head on inside. Eydis or Skuli can take care of you.
I work for Eydis. She runs the inn.
You'll be looking to rent Tiber Septim's room I take it?
Old Hroldan is the stone that the Empire's history is built on.
Don't underestimate my son, Skuli. He may look young, but he can handle any drunks we get.
more adult than his age
I cannot be defeated!
My power is supreme!
Come on, show an old man what you got!
I'll cut out your eyes and sell 'em for coin!
You're nothing but a joke!
Don't make me laugh!
My blade thirsts for your blood!
Come on. Show me you've got what it takes!
You just made the last mistake of your life!
I'll spit on your corpse!
I've killed legions like you!
Is that the best you can do?
I claim your soul for Nocturnal!
The shadows will be your undoing!
Your death will be swift!
taunting your enemy during a fight
Let me make this plain and simple. No more jobs until you pay Vex. No get to it.
Aren't you supposed to be in Markarth? Finish that job and we'll talk about more.
Slow down, you have that special request in Windhelm to finish first. After that's done, I'll send you some more jobs.
Before I'm goin' to give you any more work, you need to finish that job in Solitude.
I want you to finish that job in Whiterun first. Then we'll talk about more work.
I handle the fishin', numbers and bedlam jobs... the ones with the more personal touch.
If break-ins are more your thing, go talk to Vex.
Good, my clients are gettin' impatient.
Bloody good timin'. Just got some more clients.
All right, anythin' in particular strike your fancy?
Great. What do you want to do?
You're not getting anything until you pay the Guild back.
I think you should finish that special assignment Delvin gave you, then we'll talk.
I handle the burglary, shill, sweep and heist jobs. Most of them involve breaking and entering.
If you don't like that kind of work, talk to Delvin. He runs the more up-close and personal jobs.
Okay, what'll it be?
Got plenty, take your pick.
Good, we could use the coin.
Sybille Stentor has a grasp of magical theory that I would never have expected from a human. Even a Breton.
No doubt most folk in Skyrim consider the dragons terrifying. I find them... wondrous.
Spiced wine for ya? It's a family recipe.
Wanderer like you needs a little fire in the veins. Some spiced wine?
Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done.
I'm too old to work, but that don't make me too old to drink.
You got nothin' better to do than bother an old man?
You want to know the one truth I've learned in all my years? Life's too hard to face sober.
Hmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I'm planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out.
Some say I got my position because my cousin is the Emperor. Nonsense. The man's given me nothing. He can't even be bothered to attend my wedding.
Good business for the East Empire Company means all the more gold for the Empire.
I don't have time for anyone too lazy or cowardly to make their own way in this world.
I swear, I left another bottle right here...
If you see my father Octieve around, stay clear. He'll only ask you for money or mead.
Seems there's no end to the needs of the Imperials. But what can I help you with?
When the Stormcloaks took Solitude, I thought for sure things would slow down. But they keep me just as busy as the Imperials.
Wanderer like you must have plenty of tales to tell. But I'm afraid I'm too busy to hear 'em.
I got some fine armor, if you're lookin'.
Need a weapon? Hmmm... By the looks of ya, yeah... Think I've got somethin' you can use.
It's good to be away from the forge for a bit.
As high priest of the Eight Divines, I bid you welcome.
As high priest of the Nine Divines, I bid you welcome.
We welcome you to worship the Eight Divines, freely and openly.
We welcome you to worship the Nine Divines, freely and openly.
Wander no more, for you are among friends here, and safe.
I'm afraid I'm running errands at the moment. But please, visit me later at the Temple of the Divines.
Well, now. I'm afraid you've caught me a bit out of my element. Most of my time is spent in the Temple of the Divines, you see.
Blessings be with you.
Blessings of the Eight Divines upon you. How may I help?
Blessings of the Nine Divines upon you. How may I help?
You look troubled. Have you come seeking guidance?
Feel free to take a seat, or pray at the shrines. We appreciate worship in all its forms.
Blessings to you. The Divines are listening.
The Divines saved me from the streets, and they can save you from your trials, as well.
May the Divines guide and keep you.
May you be saved by the Divines, as I once was.
I have no business with you. Leave me.
Go away. I have more important things on my mind right now.
I don't like strangers...
You, talk to egg-brothers. Deeja has no words for you.
You have no knowledge of who you speak to. Go away.
You want knives? You want them in your belly? No? Then you stop talking to Deeja.
Dock work is not good work. Better than Black Marsh though. Much better.
Oh my, old Ma'zaka has a visitor!
What brings you all the way out here?
Oh, for the salt spray, the creek of the mast, and the clash of sabers. Those were the days...
Hey! Wanna play tag?
Hiya! What's your name? Are you visiting? What do you do?
Papa says I won't see Roggvir any more, but he wouldn't tell me why not.
My papa says I'm greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him! He says it means [QUOTE]smart,[QUOTE] but my brother says he's wrong.
Papa used to say I was greg-gare-ree-yus, just like him. I miss him...
Spare some gold for a veteran?
Can you spare a septim? Lost an eye during the Great War, or I'd earn it myself...
I hid here in Solitude for a long time but war, war follows a man until it's done with him.
Them Imperials left me to die in Anvil, and I had to fight my way back home. Then they followed me back here!
Plenty of fresh fish for ya.
I've got some salmon to sell.
You shouldn't leave Solitude without trying our fish. Best in Skyrim.
I... I don't want to talk.
I don't have anything to say.
Pardon me.
Mother says I shouldn't talk to people...
Are you here to talk about my brother? Do you think his execution was justified?
I'm not looking for conversation.
If you want to talk about my brother, I'm not interested.
I'm in mourning. Can't you see that?
Ah, welcome to Angela's Aromatics. Can I help with some herbal needs?
Need something for a potion? You're certainly in the right place.
So, what are your needs? Perhaps a pinch of this, and a bit of that? Hmm?
You were there for Roggvir's execution...
If you're looking for potions you should talk to my aunt, Angeline Morrard.
If you're looking for potions, I think I can be of service.
I'm a little busy at the moment. I've got all sorts of errands to run.
You look like an adventurous one. I bet we're kindred spirits, you and I.
Beirand said you got here just before the execution. Must have been a lovely first sight.
Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.
Hmph. You know, you've got a certain... fire in your eyes. Just like my Beirand did. Please, feel free to look around. We've got a bit of everything.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what Beirand always tells me.
Welcome. Look around. We've got everything you could want in life. At least... that's what my Beirand always told me...
I thought adventurers were supposed to look tough?
I bet my papa could beat you up.
I bet my papa could have beat you up. He was stronger than anyone.
I get to help mother with the shop. I used to help papa too... 'till I tried to use the forge...
If you're heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit.

We provide clothing for all of Solitude's most... influential residents. But for you, I'll make an exception.

So good to see you again. How can I be of service?
I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She's the one who gets on with people. It's her one virtue, really.
Welcome to the Winking Skeever, friend.
conspiratorially
Traitors, civil wars, dragons. Bah. Those troubles don't cross my doorway. So sit, relax.
Feel free to make requests.
There's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit in troubled times.
Have a drink, rest your feet and stay a little while.
Jokingly.
New in town, right? If you need a place to sleep, head over to the Winking Skeever. We keep a fine inn.

Don't mind me. I'm just running errands for the old man.
You remember your father is dead as you say this.
Seems there's always more to be done...
Glad you decided to check us out.
Soft sheets and hard liquor. What's not to like?
Welcome to Solitude. Home of the arts here in Skyrim.
It is my personal mission to ensure that the Bards College preserves the great deeds of the past, in both poetry and song.
I generally don't involve myself in politics. Good tales deal with the issues of the day, but a wise bard remains a neutral observer.
We bards record history - we do not make it. You'd do well to remember that.
Never forget, the most important job of any bard is to entertain. The day you lose your audience is the day you cut your lute strings.
Youngest bard at the Bards College, at your service.
overeager
The pleasure's all mine.
Good evening. I'm Pantea Ateia, the Master Vocalist.
It's been my honor to perform at the Blue Palace on many occasions. His late lordship was quite the admirer.
If you ask me, this damned rebellion can't end soon enough. I had to end my tour of Skyrim's courts. Too dangerous too travel.
To be honest, I simply can't stand some of my students. Only Aia shows true potential for greatness. The rest are just wasting my time.
I'm Dean of Lute at the Bards College, and no, I don't give private lessons.
It takes two things to be a good teacher. The first is patience. The second is a firm wooden stick for rapping knuckles.
Only reason I'm so good with a lute is because I'm old. It takes a lifetime to master.
You're a curmudgeonly music teacher.
Hello, yes? I'm the Dean of History. And scribe work, when I can find some quiet time.
My position, [QUOTE]Dean of History,[QUOTE] actually covers a wide range of subjects. I teach poetry, writing, history, and the finer points of court life.
What a fascinating time to be alive! Mark me, these days will be remembered long after we're gone.
If you love history, you're in the right place. Skyrim is steeped in it.
I wish only to graduate and enroll with the Legion. My drums will lead our troops to victory.
It's an honor to have Viarmo for instruction on drum, but he's far too reserved for my tastes.
Viarmo is too concerned with precision. What of instinct? Hmm? What of passion?
Lisette's a fine lass, but when I join the Legion, she's not the type to wait for my return.
I can't understand why Jorn would want to join the Imperial Legion. Soldiers only appreciate one thing, and it isn't music.
you try to find the best way to describe it
Dean Inge says a bard can never have enough practice. So, would you like a tune?
I'm so glad you got back from Olaf's Tomb okay. They gave you a tougher task then they gave me.
You know, I don't get the impression that I'm very well liked at the College...
Thane Bryling, at your service.
I can always find time to share a word with a warrior.
Many condemn the Stormcloaks, but I refuse. There is honor in fighting for what you believe.
This godsforsaken war is dividing our people and destroying our land.
Good natured but firm.
I think Bryling's the one you want to talk to. I'm mostly just here to scare away the riff raff.
You don't want to talk to me. I'm just a stand in for a dead Thane.
devilishly
The Imperials are good for business, and business is good for Skyrim.
Bryling's obsession with honor and tradition is quaint, but politically irrelevant.
I understand what's best for Solitude... and Jarl Elisif knows it.
Half of the businesses in town owe me money, and I own most of the rest. I practically run Solitude already.
Please address all questions to the Steward, Falk Firebeard.
My duty is to keep the Jarl safe. Not play nursemaid to you sycophants.
Keep your weapon out of your hands, and we'll get along just fine.
The Jarl has advised me not to talk about which court attendants I'd like to punch in the face. More's the pity.
Simmering resentment
Have you met my dear brother Erikur? The man's as trustworthy as a Khajiit goldmonger.
Quickly, if you please. I'm quite busy running errands for my bastard of a brother...
Speak if you must, but mind your tongue. I do not suffer fools gladly.
Working for Erikur may be below my stature, but the compensation is... acceptable.
You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage or leek?
An apple to keep you healthy? A tomato to keep you strong? Surely you need one or the other...
You get around, right? If you come across any Stormcloaks... gut one for me. They did the same to my brother in Whiterun.
Mind yourself in my city, friend. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...
Mind yourself in my city, lass. This here axe in full swing is a right terrible sight...
You stay out of trouble, now. The Castle Dour dungeon can break even the strongest will.
Not much work being a jailor. Long as you can ignore the pleading and all that.
Ain't many visitors come to the dungeon. Every now and then Sybille Stentor will come by looking for... volunteers.
If you have business, please see Falk Firebeard, my steward.
With the passing of my dear husband Torygg, the weighty position of Jarl has fallen to me. Please direct questions to my Steward.
Ulfric is a fool and a coward, who naively believes he can bring about peace through warfare. It's rather sad, really.
Thanks to Ulfric's rebellion, countless innocent people can't feed or clothe their families. It's unacceptably tragic.
Do you have business with the court?
I am the Jarl's Steward. If you have court business to tend to, you talk to me.
The Jarl is not to be disturbed with common affairs of court. You direct those concerns to me.
Just arrive in the city? Is it true what they say, then? There are dragons about?
Think I'll forge me a new sword, just in case things go awry here in Solitude. I'm the blacksmith's apprentice, you see.
We've got strong swords and sturdy armor, if you're looking to buy.
Apprentice blacksmith, at your service.
Blacksmith, at your service.
Be quick. I have little patience for mundane concerns.
I have so very many ways to deal with people. Very few of them pleasant.
You're trying my patience.
Surely you have something better to do...
Jarls come and jarls go, but a good cook stays for a lifetime. And I'm a very, very good cook.
Everyone knows General Tullius wields the real power Solitude. Elisif? Ah, she's a figurehead. A puppet.
Folks at court won't admit it, but Sybille Stentor scares us all to death.
Somethin' just ain't right about that Sybille. You know, I've never seen her eat a thing? That can't be natural.
Most of the time, people just forget I'm even here. That's why I hear so much good gossip.
So exciting when new folk come into town. I bet you've had plenty of adventures.
Someday, a gallant hero will ride up and take me away. Someday...
Someday, I'll be a gallant heroine. You make it look so.. appealing.
Flirtatious
The second line should be said as if it is a sudden realization.
Watch your feet. We just cleaned there!
Got lots of things to take care of. What do you need?
Hello, my child. Arkay watch over you.
May Arkay bless you with a long life, a proud death, and a restful grave.
Hello and welcome, my friend. How may I help you on this fine day?
I realize you may mistake me for a dashing swordsman, but I prefer the art of wit to that of warfare.
Your typical Solitude wench is like the city itself. Stormy exterior, but ah the charms that lie within...
Mercurial, dashing.
Ah, yet another new face. I'm from Hammerfell, you see. I can hardly keep track of all the people I've been meeting.
Always good to see a fellow traveler. I hope you've found the roads relatively safe. Free from dragons, at the very least...
If you're looking for any archery or fletching supplies, you should see Fihada. I'm just the apprentice.
Fletching suits me. It's difficult, and sometimes tedious. But a well made arrow strikes forth like the fury of a god.
You here for my next interrogation? I got nothing but time...
Leave me be, Imperial. I haven't got anything to say to you.
Don't think I don't know what's coming.
It's only a matter of time before Ahtar's blade finds my neck...
You got business at the stables?
Work hard for the future and leave the past be. That's my motto.
With a wife like Fridrika and a son like Horm, I'm the luckiest man in Skyrim.
You wouldn't know it, but before my family got killed? I was the luckiest man in Skyrim.
Is this about the stables? My husband, Geimund, handles the business.
Is this about the stables? With my husband gone, my son Horm handles the business.
I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't think there's much I can help you with.
My family's weathered its share of problems, but we don't dwell on the past.
Looking for a horse? You'll want to talk to my father, Geimund.
Need a horse? I guess I'm the one to talk to, since my da passed...
I grew up tending some of these horses. They're almost family.
When I was a boy, there was a year we couldn't afford enough feed. So I snuck my dinner out to the stables, and gave it to the horse.
Come in, come in! I was just about to take a break.
Living outside the walls is a risk, aye. But at least the guards don't come nosin' around.
We had some trouble, while back. Stormcloak tried to set the mill on fire. But we sorted her out.
Sullen, angry
Out here at work, Hjorunn treats me like an equal. Better than most in town.
Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But some days, Hjorunn's too drunk...
Any day is a good one, long as I don't have to go into town. But with Hjorunn gone...
My duty is simple - oversee the Thalmor Justiciars, and make sure they perform their duties admirably.
The Empire, in its wisdom, has come to recognize Talos worship as a barbaric remnant of a bygone age.
Talos was a heroic man, but not a god. It pains the Altmer that we must remind our younger cousins of the difference.
We only want what is best for Tamriel. Surely, the rebels will accept peace when they realize this.
I could swear I've seen you somewhere before...
Can I help you?
My husband handles the indoor work. Just as well - he'd only hurt himself out here.
It's hard work keeping Solitude fed, but I wouldn't trust any other family to do it.
Oh, hello. Have a seat, will you?
I was a much younger man when I married Katla. Now I can hardly keep up with her.
My brothers would have been appalled to see a man outdone by his wife, but not me. Without Katla, this farm would fall apart.
You're a guest. And father says we have to be polite to guests.
Mama said I could help with the goats!
Father says I don't have the knack for reading, but mama says I won't need it to work the farm.
Do you have business with the East Empire Company?
I will thank you not to interrupt me in my tasks.
You'd better have a damned good reason for being here...
Menacing
Sarcasm, cruelty
Cruel, spiteful
I've only been a part of the Red Wave's crew for a few weeks, but I've already learned to stay out of Captain Safia's way.
Forget wine, women and wealth - give me a calm sea and a good book, and I'm happy.
I hear Adonato Leotelli's staying up in Windhelm. I've read a few of his works. Be good to meet him someday.
Don't misunderstand me, friend. I like my quiet, and I like to read. But you trifle with my ship, my crew, or my captain? I will kill you.
You've not seen the night sky until you've seen it on the open sea.
Tinged with melancholy, but with a more upbeat ending.
I've seen some truly wondrous sights since I took to the seas. I had no idea a man could die in so many ways...
Just yesterday, I saw a musician in the street playing a flute. It was... beautiful. I want that flute.
Dorian is helping me perfect my fencing, but I don't think I'll ever be as good as he is.
Meals are served to Bards at designated times. Find an inn if you want to make requests.
You look a little sturdier than most of the Popinjays around here.
I once captained a ship called the Argent Raptor. She struck an iceberg and went down, just north of Windhelm.
My shipmates scoff at my love of finery, but I know envy when I hear it.
From ship's captain to lowly crewman... I suppose I deserve it after wasting all my coin on gambling and women.
I hail from Cyrodiil, but after a... misunderstanding with the law, I needed a swift change of scenery.
If it's arms or armor you need, see Beirand in Castle Dour. Bloody good blacksmith, that one.
If you need potions, head over to Angeline's Aromatics.
You can sell off that junk at Bits and Pieces.
The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
I don't abide fancy clothes, but you look like you might. I hear Radiant Raiments has a large selection.
Off the coast a ways to the east, you'll find the wreck of the Brinehammer. Never know what treasures may still be aboard.
You heard of Ravenscar Hollow? Cave on the island to the west. Place is a roost for those foul Hagravens.
If you must venture southwest, stay clear of Volskygge. It is a cursed place, a tomb where the dead still live...
The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them.
Pinemoon Cave is down to the southwest, but it ain't fit for exploring. There are stories... Vampires, some say...
Been up to the Blue Palace? It's a sight to see. Even if it is filled with fops...
We couldn't have taken this city without you, sir.
We couldn't have taken this city without you, ma'am.
Everything's in order.
Solitude is as glorious as they said it was. Nothing like Falkreath where I grew up.
Don't talk to me, defiler.
I have no words. Talk to Anwen.
Pick up your mess. Then we'll talk.
I'm not going to talk to you until this mess is cleaned up.
Talk to me again when you've cleaned up your mess.
You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat!
Tell you what - you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff.
We're married. I guess we'll need to decide where we're living, won't we? You can always stay with me.
I guess we have our entire lives together, now. Where should we live? You could stay with me....
We face the world together now. Where should we live? My home is yours.
We're united, but where should we live? My home is yours, of course.
I'm a married man! Hey, where should we live? I guess you could always stay with me.
This is the happiest day of my life. Where should we live? My home is your home now, of course.
Married. It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. Where should we live? You could stay with me....
The mine will be running better than ever thanks to you.
Nasty little buggers, aren't they?
The spiders put you through the ringer?
I hope you haven't arrived here looking for work in the mine.
Sorry, the mine's dry right now.
I hate seeing a good mine go to waste like that, you know?
If you're looking for supplies, I'd advise heading to Riften.
What brings you out to Shor's Stone?
Everything was going great in Redbelly. Then the damn spiders showed up.
You think you're tough, huh? Wandering Skyrim is a picnic compared to tunnel crawling!
The real work happens in places like this. Blood and sweat is what makes the world turn.
Sure, I used to be a soldier... but that was child's play compared to cracking rock.
Mining's my life now, I wouldn't want to do anything else.
Making that trip to Darkwater Crossing was a huge help. Thank you.
I trust my parents are well?
Would you happen to be headed towards Darkwater Crossing?
Welcome to Shor's Stone.
Have you ever been to Darkwater Crossing? Terrible name for such a beautiful place.
I suppose you're used to traveling, being a stranger around here.
Came all the way out here to see us, did you?
Ha! You showed those spiders a thing or two!
You're looking at the best miner in Skyrim.
I'd wager I could crack rock faster than anyone. Even you.
Takes a lot of strength to swing a pick axe, know what I mean?
Aye, I see the look you're giving me. Don't worry, I won't bite.
Morthal used to be a quiet place. But then, the world used to make sense.
You ask me, we'd be better off without that wizard in town.
This isn't the time or place for magic, or whatever it is Falion does.
I figure the guards could always use some help, so I keep my eyes open.
Been hoping they'd make me a guard, but not yet. Still, I'll help them out if I can.
The Jarl does little to protect us these days.
A new face! Such a welcome sight in dreary old Morthal. Welcome friend, welcome!
sing-song
The good people of Morthal have yet to embrace my talent.
Try as you may, they won't say [QUOTE]good day,[QUOTE] but will just walk away. Worry not, Morthal! Lurbuk is here to stay!
The fair Jonna does me a great courtesy by allowing me to entertain the guests of her noble establishment.
I, Lurbuk the Great, will win the hearts of the people of Morthal one day, mark my words!
Welcome to the Moorside. If you need anythin', I'll be 'round. Good to have a customer.
There ain't much to offer, but if you wanna place dry to spend the night, I'll rent you a room.
Runnin' an inn weren't my plan. But Falion decided to move here, so I joined him.
Falion had his work to keep him busy, and I needed somethin' to do. So, here I am.
I take what little business I can git. I'm grateful for anyone willin' to spend money here.
Ignore the Orc. He pays, so I let him stay.
I've tried to explain to Lurbuk that his [QUOTE]singin'[QUOTE] is gonna get his throat cut.
You'll want to be careful travelin' at night. The marsh is a dangerous place.
So, life has brought you to Morthal, and to me. What purpose this serves, we will no doubt see. Welcome.
Tamriel is full of wisdom and magic, if one is willing to look for it. Few have their eyes open.
Dark times, indeed. I fear the worst for Morthal and my people.
I try and take comfort in knowing that when all is lost, there is much to be gained.
It is my hope that I will one day return to Hjaalmarch. But the Divines have not shown this to me.
I speak, and others hear. It is my hope that instead they listen.
In Morthal, there is little to rule. But there is much to teach. And so, I am Jarl.
All this talk of rebellion and strife. Too many are focused on what might be instead of what is. It tires me to talk about it.
There is too much to learn in the world, too much to know, to fight over [QUOTE]laws[QUOTE] that have no real purpose.
We're safe here now. But what of Morthal?
The Empire brought stability, assurance to the people of Morthal, even if they didn't appreciate it. Now what do they have?
I fear for what this change will do to my family.
If you've business with the Jarl, I'd ask that you speak to me first.
I do what I can to see that Idgrod's time isn't wasted, and that she only has to deal with important matters.
Too many bother my wife with their petty problems, and then don't even understand the advice she gives them.
emphasis on 'anyone'
Morthal doesn't need any trouble. You keep your nose clean, understand?
My mind weighs heavy enough. Leave me to my food.
Leave Idgrod and her family alone. They've been through enough.
This wasn't what I wanted. Not at all.
All that ever mattered was what was best for Morthal. Leaving it in Ulfric's hands... It's not right.
I'm just here to protect the Jarl, not to chat.
Morthal has enough problems without you bothering me.
I'm under a lot of pressure. If you don't leave me alone, I won't be held responsible.
You're different, aren't you? Not like anyone else. Not in Morthal, or Skyrim.
I don't understand. Why can't we go home?
I can't sleep here. The dreams are even worse than before.
I get lost sometimes. I'm not sure where I go, but I'm not... I'm not here.
Gorm thinks I'm mad. He doesn't say it, but I know he thinks it. Is he right?
My mother sees things. She doesn't know why, but she does. Only sometimes, she doesn't see me at all.
It's Falion. He... He did it. I don't know what it was, but he did it.
Keep your wits about you. Morthal's hardly a safe place.
I'm just a poor man trying to make a living. I'd leave Morthal were it in my power.
This damned war has cost us... me... everything.
My boy's to grow up without a mother? What life is that? It's not right, I tell you.
Hasn't been seen for a while. She just vanished without a trace.
Some say the swamp took her. Part of me wishes it were that simple.
Have you seen my mother? I'm still waiting for her to come home.
Papa says that I shouldn't keep waiting. Why not? Mama has to come home some time.
Who are the Stormcloaks, and why would mama want to spend time with them instead of me?
The people here work so hard, and they never allow themselves a moment of fun. It's such a pity. It won't last forever though.
These people are like cattle. All they do is work, sleep and eat.
Gathering plants, picking mushrooms, brewing potions. It all gets so dreary after a while. This town needs something exciting to happen.
Thank you for saving me from Alva. I was completely under her evil spell. I'll never forgive myself for what happened to Helgi and my wife.
I... I'm not one for talk. Try to keep to myself.
Alva's been good to me ever since... well, since the fire.
I just try and do my job, and not to think about what's happened. Try to find what happiness I can.
Ignore the talk of spirits and creatures and such. It's just superstition.
There's enough real troubles in the world without making new ones up.
You are new to Morthal. We have not spoken before. This is interesting.
The changes in Morthal are of little consequence to me. So long as the laws are upheld, I do not care who does the upholding.
My talents are much needed here, in order to keep Morthal... safe.
Morthal is a troubled place, and it is my duty to see it rest in peace.
Please remain indoors at night. It is dangerous to go outside.
Do you like magic? Falion says I'm good at learning. I like learning about magic.
My mother and father died years ago. Falion takes care of me now.
I asked Falion if someday I could learn from the mages in Winterhold, but he doesn't like that idea.
If you need any alchemy supplies, I'll do my best to provide them. Assuming I haven't used them all up.
Jorgen and I both work hard, all the time. Morthal is important to both of us.
I don't get many customers, but that leaves me time to try things out. Experiment, I guess.
Unless it's about the mill, I don't have time to talk. Too much to do.
We've gone from a Jarl lost in her own head to a Jarl that cares for nothing but herself. Lot of good that does us.
The mill is my responsibility, and that's what I care about. That's all. Understand?
I just want to be left alone to do my job, and to enjoy what little free time I have when I have it.
We've got all the miners we need, so I hope you're not here looking for work.
Hjaalmarch isn't much, but it's a good start. I'll make a name for myself here, then maybe work my way up to someplace like Riften.
Nothing here but the mine. Probably best you keep moving.
Pactur and I, we make sure the miners aren't stealing, and that the ore makes it to Solitude.
It's good that Sorli has finally been given some real authority.
I'll see to it that Sorli is safe now that she's running Morthal.
We left Sirgar in charge back at Stonehills. I hope that wasn't a mistake.
Sorli and I are just here to make sure the mine is run proper.
Wouldn't ever have expected to wind up living in a place like this, but the money's good.
Don't bother the miners. They've got work to do.
I'm in charge now that my parents are in Morthal.
I figured that I would run the mine someday. I just didn't figure that would mean now.
Guess the Empire's going to need plenty of iron what with all the fighting. That'll be good for us, I suppose.
Talk to my parents if you need something.
My parents keep a close eye on the miners. They can't be trusted too much.
I hear there's been fighting in Skyrim. Rebellion, maybe. Wonder if our iron is being used for weapons.
If you're here about the mine -- it's already got an owner, and she's not selling. If not, then please stay out of my workers' way.
You get used to the cold after a while. The harder you work, the warmer you stay.
I spend every waking moment making sure the mine is put to good use.
Bryling owns this mine. I wouldn't have much to live for if she hadn't offered me a job.
My job is my life. Whatever happened before doesn't matter.
I'm just here to work the mine. Nothing else matters anymore.
The outside world means little to us, and we'd like it to stay that way.
When you work hard enough, really get into a rhythm, everything else just fades away.
I'm just trying to make a living. I've no interest in trouble.
annoyed, [QUOTE]others[QUOTE] meaning YOU
The mine gives us purpose. Something many of us have wished for.
Stonehills' warmth is a welcome change in this cold, bleak land.
Teeba-Ei the hatchling never imagined working a mine in this cold place. Greater things were dreamt of.
This is not where Teeba-Ei was meant to live out the rest of his days.
We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked.
I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill.
The Initiation and her mother's transformation are things you're afraid of.
You've just realized what must be done.  With resolve.
I'm going with you whether you like it or not.
Let's get up there before mother finds out what we're doing.
You want in there? Here's my spare key. Take whatever you want.
Alva? Didn't think she had it in her.
So Alva did it to get Hroggar for herself? I should have suspected her.
By the gods! I assume you have proof.
Bah. If there was a tonic that could help me, I would have found it by now...
Passive aggressively, wanting Quintus to hear
It's buried with its maker, Curalmil, in a long forsaken cave to the west of here.
Curalmil was a crafty one, even in death. You would need the skills of a master alchemist to reach his resting place.
Luckily for you, I've already made the mixture. Here, take it.
The coughing overtakes him again
A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice.
A small container, made of the magically infused snow that first fell on the Throat of the World.
It is said that the Phial will replenish whatever fluid is placed inside of it.
For an alchemist like myself, it is the most pure expression of my art. To create from nothingness is... poetry.
I have spent my entire life searching for it.
It brought me all the way to these frozen reaches from the warm embrace of Summerset Isle.
Entire years spent in libraries. Seeking out tiny villages with local legends that contain but a whisper of a hint of the Phial.
I even named my shop after it, hoping that it might attract anyone who had heard of it.
coughing
... for in my current condition, I'll never be able to lay my hands on it.
Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to.
But by Sithis, I hope I'm making the right choice here. You may be an effective killer, but your command of guile leaves much to be desired.
The sealed letter you delivered to me was mysteriously unsealed upon its arrival. I can only assume you've read its contents. Sloppy...
But moving on to business. As you probably already know from reading the letter... you're going to a wedding.
Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.
Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride.
Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding.
And they say romance is dead.
Soon. I'm not exactly sure when. But not to worry - the ceremony itself is being followed up by a public banquet that will last for several days.
Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity.
An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II.
Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation.
So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire.
The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.
Every now and again, we like to remind the shopkeepers that we're in charge.
If that means breaking into their strongboxes and stealing something valuable from them, then so be it.
Got a shop owner with a very choice item a client wants to get his hands on if you do the dirty work.
Got a good one here involving a shop, a waylaid shipment of goods and an angry client. You fill in the blanks. You want in?
I have just the place. The owner likes to stash some lovely trinkets in his strongbox like this beauty. Can you get it for us?
The owner of this place just inherited an heirloom from a relative. You want in?
The owner of this shop stiffed us on their last protection payment, but we're taking it anyway. You want to help us on this one?
Jiit = [QUOTE]Jeet[QUOTE]
Got a client in desperate need for this item. He won't say what it's for, and we don't care. Can you take this one?
This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy.
Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks.
In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance.
Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay.
Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take.
All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks.
And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess.
But what's all this about? What are you two doing here?
Just head north - you can't miss it.
It's the capital of Whiterun Hold, the biggest and the best of the nine holds of Skyrim. But don't take my word for it.
Cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls.
When you get to Whiterun just keep going up. When you get to the top of the hill, you're at Dragonsreach, the Jarl's palace.
Just follow the road north. When you get to Honningbrew Meadery, turn left and the road will take you to the city gates.
It's not far. We used to go to the market there every month or so, until the roads got so dangerous with the war and all.
You really think I can be a blacksmith someday, papa? As good as Eorlund Gray-Mane? Or maybe... even as good as you?
Oh, I know it! You keep working hard, like you been doing, and you could be the greatest blacksmith Skyrim has ever seen.
He he. Thanks, papa.
You see, you're not well! Have a seat and I'll fetch you some tonic.
coughing violently, unable to speak
Master, you're far too old for this sort of journey. We don't know what's inside...
I'll be fine.
I'm so close to the answer...
May the Eight guide you to the Phial...
Please hurry -- I fear my master doesn't have much time left.
send off
Please, open the door. I need to get out of here.
Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me.
I hope we reach Markarth soon.
I can't wait to learn from the priestesses.
Please, let's hurry to the Temple before the Forsworn find me again.
I hope Fjotra is happy in the temple. We're so honored to have given her.
Thank you for getting her back from the Forsworn. Dibella was smart to have sent you.
Let's get to the Forsworn camp. Her life could be in danger.
I swear, if those things have laid a hand on her...
Let's find Fjotra. This place gives me the creeps.
How could they live like this? It's disgusting.
I'm sorry, the Temple of Dibella is closed. You can receive your blessing, if you wish, but the other sisters are in seclusion.
I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth.
But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it.
I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on.
afraid
They were a secret cabal of the three top rogues in the Thieves Guild. No one knew their identities.
Some people say they watched over the group, others say they were reserved for the most elite jobs. I don't really know.
It wasn't until recently that I heard Mercer Frey and this Dark Elf named Karliah were a part of that group.
Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway.
Karliah didn't even want it, she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went.
extremely irritated
I'm sorry to say your payment for the job will have to go to elsewhere since you feel like taking things in your own direction.
changing subjects
Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?
Stunned.
This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again.
Karliah destroyed everything this Guild stood for. She murdered my predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild.
After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished.
almost musing to yourself aloud
If only we knew where she was...
There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus... a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum.
suddenly resolved
very cold
Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.
I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves.
We both agree it's best to keep these matters in house.
I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before.
Now, I'm not sure that you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that?
Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon.
I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.
Now, I...
This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!
astonished, talking to self
I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.
Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation.
I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here in the College.
More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically.
So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants.
Find out why he's here, and what he wants.
I'd simply like to talk to you.
The Augur? Really? Well, it's certainly not my place to say anything about it.
I think you'd better go see Mirabelle Ervine.
What? The Augur? Oh no, I'm quite sure that's... He's nothing I'm involved in. No, no.
Mirabelle Ervine... Or Tolfdir. They're qualified to discuss him. Not me, definitely not.
It's not enough that you've stolen the spotlight with this Eye thing, now you're looking for the Augur?
I'm not sure what you're playing at, but you'd do well to remember your place around here.
The Augur? Tragic story, really. At least, the way I heard it. But that was a long time ago.
It was some experiment gone horribly wrong. Ghastly results, I was told. And his ghost still roams the halls, they say.
Perhaps I'll ask Tolfdir what really happened. I understand he was here at the time.
Oh, no. No, that won't do at all.
Not my problem. Not even a little. Take it to Tolfdir, he's supposed to be looking after you lot.
That's nothing you need to concern yourself with.
The what of what? No. No idea.
If it's important, maybe Tolfdir knows. He seems to know a lot.
Huh? That sounds ominous. Are you getting yourself into even more trouble?
Did you ask Mirabelle? She runs things around here, after all.
I've never heard of anything like that. Did you ask Tolfdir? He's been here a long time, and seems to know almost everything.
surprised, annoyed
lying, covering something up
Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time.
My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked.
Are you going to see him? Do tell him [QUOTE]hello[QUOTE] for me, won't you?
Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation.
Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.
I am that which you have been seeking.
Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun.
But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.
annoyed, warning
happily accepting a bribe
slyly trumping up a charge
Come on. Let's see what you're made of.
Get him!
Get her!
Twelve septims on the big one!
Fight! Fight!
Drive that snowback to the ground. Come on!
You just going to stand there and take it? Fight back.
Who taught you to fight? Keep those hands up!
Don't let him get away with this!
Don't let her get away with this!
Come on, he's not so tough.
Come on, she's not so tough.
You want a real fight, eh?
Master, look. It's the Phial.
weak, dying, weakly coughing
laughing through tears
last words
He is gone.
But thanks to you, he died knowing his life's work was not in vain.
As am I.
You acted very nobly in helping my master realize his life's work. Thank you for that.
As for myself, I've always been content to simply be an alchemist.
I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him.
Here, keep it. You are as much a part of its legend now as Curalmil was. I hope it brings you the happiness that my master desired.

about to start a fight
angry, under the breath half-growl
Hadvar! We've been so worried about you! Come, you two must be hungry. Sit down and I'll get you something to eat.
Sigrid! We have company!
Now, then, boy. Helgen was destroyed? How did you get away?
Now, then, boy. What's the big mystery? What are you doing here, looking like you lost an argument with a cave bear?
I don't know where to start. You know I was assigned to General Tullius's guard.
We were stopped in Helgen when we were attacked... by a dragon.
shaking his head in dismay
say [QUOTE]a dragon[QUOTE] like it's the most shocking thing you've heard
Mara's mercy! A dragon... in Helgen? Why, it could be here at any moment!
Husband. Let him tell his story.
I need to get back to Solitude and let them know what's happened.
I thought you could help us out. Food, supplies, a place to stay.
Of course! Any friend of Hadvar's is a friend of mine. I'm glad to help however I can.
Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?
Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin.
commenting on finding something interesting
Good, you're finally here.
I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.
pleased with self
Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead.
Very sarcastic
You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?
Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade.
The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.
She was a stubborn Dunmer... always had to do everything her way.
But she was also the best... bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year.
Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.
If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill.
remembering a happier moment
When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound an arrow pierced his throat.
Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest.
Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky... she missed my heart by mere inches.
I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.
The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into a opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man.
softer toned, as choked up as a tough man can get
very grim
Who... who are you? What's going on?
prayer
It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh?
Listen, I'm going to lay up here for a while. You can make your own way to Solitude from here.
I'd recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude.
I hope I'll see you in Solitude. Good luck.
I hope that dragon isn't still flying around here somewhere.
I still almost can't believe it... a real, live dragon...
Yeah? What is it?
gruffly but warmly
Uncle Alvor! Hello!
Hadvar, thank Talos! Your friend told me about Helgen...
Hadvar? What are you doing here? Are you on leave from...
shocked at Hadvar's haggard appearance
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Shh.. Uncle, please. Keep your voice down. I'm fine. But we should go inside to talk.
What's going on? And who's this?
in quiet voice, trying to hush and calm his uncle
Come on inside. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell us what happened.
Okay, okay. Come inside, then. Sigrid will get you something to eat and you can tell me all about it.
I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol.
I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands.
Don't get me wrong, he could scam a beggar out of his last septim... but he's no mastermind.
No, no. Mercer wants him alive, for now.
Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we've got at the East Empire Company.
Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step into something he can't scrape off his boot.
Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company Warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude.
That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores.
He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse.
There are thieves and then there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.
The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying.
Keep your eyes on him, he's quite crafty.
Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important.
If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding out on us and has more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find that information quite valuable as well.
A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry.
Suddenly nervous... makes you trip over your lines a bit.
composure regained, back to mock friendliness
Thank the gods. I'll get to work on the Phial straight away.
Even though the Phial was damaged, I still think your efforts deserve reward.
Now, if you'll pardon me, I'm going to tend to Nurelion. I can make his final days a bit less painful.
Not annoyed - optimistic.
In life, Hevnoraak drained his own blood from his body. His goal was to transfer his power back into himself after death, becoming a powerful lich.
The vessels contain that very blood. Empty them and you remove any chance he has of regaining his former powers.
More dangerous than you know. Left alone, however, he will awaken when he has grown too powerful to be stopped. This is the only way to be sure.
Very well. Empty the vessels into the sconce near the throne, then sit in the throne.
When you have done so, I will unbind Hevnoraak. He will awaken in a weakened state, but the lich is still to be reckoned with. Be ready.
Yes, old friend, I'm afraid it's not good news.
When you broke up the binding Potema escaped. We've encountered some of her minions.
Styrr says she's still in spirit form or we'd all be dead already.
You've already done us a service in stopping the binding, but I need you to go talk to him, to see if Styrr can tell us what to do next.

Halt, outlander!
Surrender or die, outlander!
Clanfolk, stop the outlander!
Hold, there!
Lay down your weapons!
We are ready to mount our final attack.
Infos conditioned on Attack Delta go here.
Join the forces mustering outside of [CAPITAL]. (Infos conditioned on Capital location go here)
The attack will be launched imminently. Gather your weaponry and get to the front lines... Now, soldier!
Sometimes we like to remind a city that we mean business, so we hit it hard. Just steal whatever we can until we've made an impression.
Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.
Steal from anywhere in the hold, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?
I always have bedlam jobs. Just remember to hit them fast and don't let them see you. Feel like going for it?
Of course. Don't forget to keep out of sight, it doesn't count if they catch you red-handed. You ready?
Taking an easy job, eh? Well, go and do some damage. Just stick to the shadows and keep out of sight. Want to go for it?
I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.
Is that so? You ought to join the Stormcloaks, if you haven't already.
Seems to me they're a bunch of narrow-minded bigots, just like you.
Meantime, you best steer clear of me.
Good. Too many Nords in this town have been listening to Ulfric's narrow-minded words.
He's tough, loyal to his men and a good leader, but if you're not a Nord, Ulfric will never trust you.
That's just what Ulfric wants you to think.
If that's what you really believe, then you're a fool. Never had much patience for fools, myself.
And you're right, at least as far as I'm concerned.
Don't let Ulfric or some of these other short-sighted Nords bother you. Most of us are happy to welcome newcomers.
If I make it back to Solitude, I'll put in a good word for you with General Tullius.
The Legion could sure use someone like you. Good luck.
You one of those [QUOTE]Skyrim for the Nords[QUOTE] types?
I killed a lot of High Elves in the Great War, and I didn't die. I guess that makes me a war hero.
The [QUOTE]Great War[QUOTE]... there was nothing great about it. Thousands died on both sides, and where did it get us?
Did we really save the Empire? Or did we just plant the seeds for Ulfric's uprising, and another war?
Help the Dark Elves? Oh, you must have heard me talking to Malthyr.
The Dark Elves live in a run-down slum called the Gray Quarter. Ulfric's content to keep it that way.
I guess they think I can open Ulfric's eyes to their plight, and get him to lift a finger on their behalf.
I'm trying, but Ulfric is set in his ways. For him, there's two kinds of people in this world -- Nords, and the folk beneath them.
Grumpy
Calling out from a marketplace stall.
Called out from a market stall.
Drunk, angry shouting
Will you spare a few coins to help someone who's got nothing?
I ain't askin' for much, just a few septims.
The Divines smile on those who show mercy an' charity.
A few septims ain't nothing. You can spare that, can't you?
Reverent prayer
Friendly, polite
With enthusiasm and showmanship
Windhelm is divided into four quarters. The Gray Quarter is the one that's home to all the city's Dark Elves.
If it looks to you like an impoverished slum, that's because it is. Ulfric prefers that we live in squalor.
He has nothing but disdain for anyone who isn't a Nord. He tolerates us, but that's the extent of his hospitality.
Not a day goes by that I don't think about returning to the ancestral home of my people.
Still, even with the rough treatment we've had at the hands of Ulfric and his lot, I've got ties here.
It's probably more trouble to pack up and leave than it is to stay. Besides, Ambarys can't run the cornerclub on his own.

Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of the Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch.
Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or... you could use...
The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?
Pelagius Septim the Third, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him!
Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind...
Let's make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage?
Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?
excited, but interrupted at the end
Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?
And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing.
You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ta ta!
Our daughter. Our little girl. She hadn't seen her tenth winter.
choking up
The name tastes vile in your mouth.
He's stewing in the pit while we figure out what to do with him, if you've got the stomach to look at him.
What could drive a man to do something like this?
This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations.
Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it.
I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times.
Like... with the little girl.
I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway.
I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons.
I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame.
That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control.
Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.
Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore.
Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you.
I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin.
Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell.
I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do.
When I saw the little girl, I was just... I could feel it coming on. I could taste the... I needed to hunt.
But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud.
I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me.
She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then...
Snapping out of his bloodlust reverie.
Let me take a look at what you found.
The Companions? In Jorrvaskr? They're recruiting new members, from what I hear.
It's too bad they executed Roggvir before we got here.
They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready.
Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say.
The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.
There was a fight down in the Ratway, but reports are... sketchy. Some say it was Thalmor Agents, others say Thieves Guild. Some say it was both.
Word is Elenwen's furious. Big party at the Thalmor Embassy, and one of the guests went someplace they shouldn't. Caused quite a commotion.
Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time.
What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?
By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?
By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon.
There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...
The guards in Dragonsreach say you've aided the Jarl. On behalf of Whiterun, I thank you.
I've seen you helping the Jarl. If only all visitors to Whiterun were as noble.
It was you convinced the Jarl to trap that dragon in the keep. And by Ysmir, it actually worked.
There's a dragon. Here. In Dragonsreach. And I thought it was just a name.
We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?
Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, man, why?
Is it true what they say? There was a dragon held captive in Whiterun, and you... you released it? By the gods, woman, why?
The Greybeards have arranged a truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperials. How long can such a thing last?
The Greybeards have called a peace council, at High Hrothgar. And can you believe it - both Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have agreed to go.
Word is spreading like magefire! The great evil has been vanquished! You have truly saved us all!
All hail the Dragonborn!
In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!
You! You're the one who wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! All the guards are talking about it... You're a hero to us all!
You hear the news? The Emperor has been murdered! Right here, in Skyrim. By the gods, if the Dark Brotherhood can do that, nobody's safe...
By the gods. The Emperor's been murdered. On his own ship... moored in the inlet. It was... the Dark Brotherhood. There was nothing we could do...
That old woman who runs the orphanage has been murdered. Say, didn't I see you coming out of there...?
Been a murder, over in Riften. Some old lady who runs an orphanage. Those poor children must be heartbroken.
Hey! You're the one who killed Alain Dufont, up in Raldbthar. Oh yeah, word about that got around. Man was a piece of bandit trash, is what I hear.
The Emperor's cousin, killed. Right here in Solitude. I feel nothing but shame...
The cousin of the Emperor was murdered! In Solitude, at her own damn wedding. Not a chance we would have let that happen here.
whispering, kind of conspiratorial
There was some ruckus over by that weird black door. You weren't involved in that craziness, were you?
Been lots of people coming and going through that creepy black door. And noises...  I'd say it sounds like construction, but that's crazy. Right?
fearful and respectful
sort of talking to himself
We just received word that somebody tried to kill the Emperor! Turned out to just be his double, but can you imagine if he had succeeded?
They're saying the Dark Brotherhood has been destroyed. Wiped off the face off Tamriel. But that's not entirely true... is it?
You're the one all the guards are talking about. You went into that Sanctuary... wiped out the Dark Brotherhood! Friend, I owe you a drink.
whispering, a bit conspiratorial
Welcome to Riften, home of the Thieves Guild. Or so they'd have you believe. It's all lies. They're just thugs... vermin, creeping around the Ratway.
The say the College has been snooping around Saarthal. Mages in a burial crypt. No good can come of that...
Some are saying the Psijic Monks have been seen in Skyrim. They're an ancient order. I had 'em figured for dead.
You hear the news? Those damn mages blew up Winterhold! Guess it was just a matter of time...
Word is the College of Mages is back to normal. If there's such a thing for that lot.
Your name's been cleared... by Thonar Silver-Blood. Consider yourself lucky.
So Madanach was behind those murders. Gods help us.
By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure?
whistles at the beginning, like he's impressed.
That mace... get it away from me. Get it away...
Your shield... Dwarf-make, is it not? But yet it seems so much... more.
That hammer... Why that's Aegisbane, heirloom of Clan Shatter-Shield! Last I heard, it was stolen by a couple of swindlers. Alain and... Muiri. Yeah.
What a foul and unnatural weapon you wield. Never have I seen its like.
Ugh. Your breath is foul. What've you been eating?
As if Skyrim didn't have enough outsiders. Now we've got mercenaries from Hammerfell struttin' about...
From what I hear, you're the one gave the Thalmor a black eye. Sure know how to pick your enemies, don't you?
You've come to Dawnstar at a strange time, friend. Seems everyone in the town is having nightmares...
The damned nightmares have finally stopped. Don't suppose you'd know anything about that?
You've been seen in the company of the Companions. That's an honorable path you're on, friend.
I know of your deeds, and am honored to address a member of the Companions.
Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like wet dog.
Heard about what you did. Killing those foul witches. Well done, Companion.
Kodlak killed, Jorrvaskr attacked. How could this happen, within the walls of Whiterun?
I heard about the attack on Jorrvaskr, and the killing of your honored leader. You have my sympathies, Companion.
Kodlak White-Mane has been laid to rest, I know. May his soul live forever in the halls of Sovngarde.
You... you're the Harbinger. Of the Companions. It is my honor to stand before you.
I hear the East Empire Company has reopened, thanks in no small part to you. Well done. All of Skyrim benefits from their trade.
You did this city a great service by catching that killer. Well done.
Good thing you did for Nurelion, retrieving that phial for him before he died. Man was obsessed.
By Ysmir, you've helped save the Gildergreen. Words can't express what that means to this city.
That sapling you recovered means the Gildergreen will live again. Your deed honors the people of Whiterun.
You've actually done it. You've found the Sybil of Dibella. You have done Markarth a tremendous service.
You... you were talking to that murderous savage. And then he escaped. What are you hiding?
First Torygg and now Elisif. Damn those Stormcloaks. Let's hope that Erikur fares better than they did.
Filthy she-hound Elisif got what she deserved. Let her serve as [QUOTE]High Queen[QUOTE] of Oblivion, for all I care.
Solitude wouldn't be the same without the Fire Festival. City owes you a debt of gratitude.
It's no secret the Aretino boy is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!
Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.
Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn...
Guard might get nervous, a woman approaches with her weapon drawn...
Sheathe those claws, Khajiit...
You come up to me, fists raised? You looking for a beating?
Releasing a captured dragon. I don't think I'll ever understand that one...
Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
surprised and eager
You have vanquished a great evil from Skyrim. You have saved this land... and our very souls.
No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.
Looks like it's really happening. A peace council, attended by both Ulfric and Tullius, up on High Hrothgar. Maybe there's hope for Skyrim yet.
This truce with the Stormcloaks won't last a fortnight. Bloody savages will kill us while we sleep.
A truce? With the Imperials? They'll murder us all, first chance they get.
I caught a glimpse of that captured dragon. It's.. beautiful. In its own way.
Trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach. Damn clever idea you had, I have to admit.
You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine.
You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?
If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help, of course.
If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we.
emphasis on [QUOTE]I'm[QUOTE]
For a dragon to attack Kynesgrove... Why? Why there? Is no place safe?
If I'd been on guard at the Thalmor Embassy, wouldn't nobody be disturbing that party...
Thalmor in the Ratway? What's next, Spriggans in the Bee and Barb?
I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?
You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary. Killed all those Dark Brotherhood types. But I was... sick that day.
Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?
I know who you are, assassin. I guess the rumors about your kind's [QUOTE]extinction[QUOTE] have been... exaggerated.
So the Emperor had a decoy. Poor bastard got murdered, too. But then, I guess that was his job...
Now, I know who you are. And... and I know your business... Just, please... These are good folk we got here. Mostly...
It ain't true what they say about you and... and the Dark Brotherhood? Is it?
There are stories about you, and dark tidings in Dawnstar...
Seems the Emperor's coming to Skyrim... and one of his own protectors was going to have him assassinated. Can't trust anyone these days.
I heard you were at the wedding of the Emperor's cousin. In Solitude? Gods, that must have been horrible...
Look, that Vici woman had a bodyguard. I know it's terrible she got murdered at her own wedding, but the city guard is hardly to blame...
You ask me, those brats in the orphanage are better off, now that old Grelod is dead.
The Emperor's cousin Vittoria Vici is getting married soon. The reception will be public - anyone in Solitude can attend.
The Emperor of Skyrim. Dead. These are dark times, my friend. Dark times, indeed...
The Thieves Guild used to run this city. Now they're nothing but braggarts and bullies, rotting to death down in their Ratway...
What business do College mages have in a place like Saarthal, anyway? It's a place for Nord dead... not your weird experiments.
One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic Monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say.
Imagine, blowing up an entire town. Damn College... Winterhold will never be the same.
You're that Mage from the College. Right? Hear things have finally calmed down over there.
You put those Forsworn down. Good job.
Gods damn those Forsworn. So many dead...
You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
Wonder what it's like for those Thalmor, now that they've been taken down a notch...
The people here are still plagued with nightmares. It's... unnatural.
No more nightmares. Thank the gods for that.
Now I remember - you're that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?
Honored Companion. How can I assist you?
Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?
I'm telling you, I heard it. Howling. Those werewolf tales are true.
I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.
With respect, Companion, I'd ask that you and your friends muzzle that dog of yours. The howling coming from Jorrvaskr has gotten out of hand.
If it isn't the slayer of the Glenmoril Witches. How can I assist you, Companion?
Who would dare attack the leader of the Companions? In his own hall? There'll be blood for this, I know it.
Kodlak White-Mane is in a better place now. For is there any place better than Sovngarde?
Thanks again for helping reopen the East Empire Company. Gonna have them import me some of that aged Breton cheese.
I was this close to catching that killer. I swear it.
With Nurelion gone, I suppose Quintus has taken over business in the White Phial.
The Gildergreen blooms again. All thanks to you.
The Gildergreen will bloom again. All thanks to you.
Thanks for clearing out that vampire nest. You saved Morthal.
Wonder what kinds of things they've got the Dibella doing, over in the temple. Mostly praying, I reckon...
I know you had some part in Sinding's escape. Don't deny it...
We'll protect Erikur as best we're able, but I fear the throne of Solitude is cursed.
Watch the skies, traveler.
Stay out of trouble, Argonian.
What is it, Argonian?
Stay out of trouble, lizard.
Staying out of trouble, kinsman?
How can I help a brother Nord?
Stay out of trouble, Nord.
Don't cross me, Elf.
Stay out of trouble, Elf.
What is it, Elf?
Stay out of trouble, Khajiit.
What is it, Khajiit?
What do you want... cat?
Stay out of trouble, Redguard.
What is it, Redguard?
Stay out of trouble, Imperial.
What is it, Imperial?
Stay out of trouble, Orc.
What is it, Orc?
Hail, Companion.
You're that one from the College. Heard about you.
So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?
Try to hide it all you want. I know you're in the Thieves Guild... and so do the other guards.
whispers... conspiratorial
disgusted, like he might puke
Ah, now that's a fine shield. And not mere Dwarven... is it?
gasp before speaking
Ah, Aegisbane. Sigil of Clan Shatter-Shield. But didn't that get stolen awhile back? Hmph. Must be rememberin' wrong.
Fine armor you've got there. Dwarven make, am I right?
Ebony armor. By Ysmir, 'tis a wondrous sight.
whistles at the beginning, like he's impressed
Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight.
You come talking to me wearing Imperial armor? You got stew for brains?
That's some fine Imperial armor you've got there.
Judging by your armor, I'd say you're an Imperial scout. If so, well met.
For your sake, I hope your took that armor from a dead Imperial scout...
You wear the armor of a mercenary. Now that's the life.
That's good armor you've got there, friend. Iron, solid and true.
Hmph. You wear that armor well. Iron may be simple, but it'll stop enough to keep you in the fight.
Fancy the leather armor, huh? Something to be said for going light.
That armor... it's like nothing I've ever seen. Like forged midnight...
Orcish armor, hmm? Had me a set of that once. Ugly and strong, like those that forged it.
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Can't say I envy you that job.
That armor... Are you one of the Emperor's protectors? Not very good at your job, are you?
That's fine scale armor you've got on there. Shiny.
Aye, now that's some fine armor. Good old-fashioned steel.
Ah, steel plate. Now that's a solid choice of armor.
What do you aim to do with that hammer, friend? Knock down a house?
No.. get that accursed mace away from me...
You wear the armor of the bear, my friend. A fine choice.
You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?
That Stormcloak armor's getting on my nerves...
You wear that Stormcloak armor well, friend.
You wear the armor of a brigand. Best not cause any trouble on my watch.
I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.
You wear the garb of a true Nord. I salute you.
Pigsticker like that's not going to get you far. Best visit the blacksmith.
That iron sword's pretty undependable. You should try steel.
Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?
Aye, now that there's a beautiful sword. Like a sliver of midnight.
Why the Elven blade, hmm? Nord steel not good enough for you?

I know your kind, always sneaking about.
Go fiddling with any locks around here, we're going to have a real problem.
Fancy yourself an alchemist, hmm? Never could get the hang of that.
You're the one casts those illusions. Impressive.
Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.
Best offense is a good defense, am I right?
Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
Heard about you and your honeyed words...
Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?
Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings.
Takes a fair bit of strength to carry a greatsword like that. But can you use it?
Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer.
Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself.
The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that.
You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons.
No lollygaggin'.

I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?
Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark.
Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...
Yawwns really big before speaking.

Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.
Thinking of settling in? There's a house for sale - Breezehome. You should talk to the steward up in the keep if you're interested.
You're that one lives in Breezehome, right? Fine place. Almost bought it myself.
Hjerim is a fine house, and it's up for sale. You should talk to the steward in the keep if you're interested.
Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...
My heart goes out to Clan Shatter-Shield. Kin murdered, family warhammer stolen... There's no fairness in all that.
Proudspire Manor, now there's a fine home. Up for sale, too. If you're interested, talk to the steward, in the keep.
You own Proudspire Manor, hmm? Beautiful house. At least from the outside.
If you're looking to settle in Riften, there's a house for sale - Honeyside. See the steward in the keep if you want it.
Smart thing you did, buying Honeyside. Nice place, and why pay for an inn?
Ah, Vlindrel Hall's a fine home, if you can afford it. The steward in the keep can tell you more.
So you bought Vlindrel Hall, eh? Wish I could afford a house that nice.
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!

Oh, you just don't understand. Without him, I am not free! Without him, I am doomed! All of his empire shall fall into chaos...
He stays in the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The doors are locked, and only Falk Firebeard can grant entry.
But I hear the maids, Una and Erdi, know how to enter it for cleaning. Surely they can help for such an important matter?
Yes, yes, go. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens...
Yes, but don't try to use force! He's far too mighty. He'd crush you like a clay doll, or drop you from the sky, or simply eat your brain right up!
Oh, but he probably won't do those things to you. Probably. Just remind him to come home, and... there'll be no fighting or unpleasantness. Probably.
He's just a little confused at the moment, is all. Knowing my master, he may very well reward you for bringing him to his senses!
Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen. Ah, the folly of youth...
You know, you remind me of myself at a young age. All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears...
Speaking quickly. Deadly serious.
Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...?

Oh, pardon me. Were you saying something? I do apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably...

You again? We have nothing else to discuss. Now move.
Why are you following me? I told you, I don't know anything else!
Look, I've told you everything. Now leave me alone!
Our business has concluded and you're standing in my way.
Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk.
No Firebrand Wine yet? How disappointing.
Hmmm, you again. What is it this time?
What did you need?
Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.
Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece!
Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant.
[QUOTE]Night of Tears[QUOTE], eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting.
Did you read it yourself? If I recall it correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir.
reluctant, don't want to show that you're pleased
My master has abandoned me! Abandoned his people. And nothing I say can change his mind.
Now he refuses to even see me. He says I interrupt his vacation! It's been so many years... Won't you please help?
Without his guidance, our homeland is falling apart. North wages war against south! The holy flame flickers and dies! We need his return.
Oh, but... I'm sure he'll repay you when he comes to his senses! His favor is a powerful, powerful thing. And so very worth any... inconveniences.
Last I saw him, he was visiting a friend in the Blue Palace. But no one as mundane as the Jarl. No, no... such people are below him.
No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea.
Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important. No entering Pelagius' Wing without that.
He is a great man, but one rarely praised! He rules twin empires that span the length and breadth of our minds! All know him, but few can name him!
But... he has forbidden me from saying his name. He says it distracts him, and woe to those who draw his ire.
But you will know him when you see him. He's the one who made me like this!
I'll make an exception for you, but do not bring anything out when you leave. Too many dark deeds transpired in those halls...
Well... I suppose in that case, it's okay to let you in. But only briefly. Be careful, and come right back!
If you really want to... Just be careful of the ghost! He snuck up on me once and scared me sick. It took a week for me to feel better...
How rude! Can't be bothered to host an old friend for a decade or two.
I have a saying - I'm not going to feel what you have to like. Or something like that.
Is it just me or is it getting saner and saner these days?
Pelagius stopped by and mentioned he hated you. Or I mentioned he hated you and he agreed.
I hope you're having a good time. Actually, I hope I'm having a good time. I could care less about you.
I see you've been minding your own business. So how is the mind business?
Do you mind? I'm busy doing the fishstick. It's a very delicate state of mind!
Please, take pity on an old madman!
Who among you can help me?
Wait, hear my plea! My master, he is lost between worlds and I cannot bring him back!
Why does everyone ignore me? Why do you turn your heads? Why will no one help me?
The flame of my master burns low. Without him, we are all lost and forever gray... Please, help us!
More tea, Pelly my dear?
Oh, I couldn't. Goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do...

Thank the gods. Now let's deal with these other hunters. We hunt together!
Thank you for your help. I will make my home here, away from anyone I might hurt.
I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh?
Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway.
I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering.
I think one of those volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn.
He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him.
When they left, he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I suppose as a way to ingratiate himself.
Let's just call it a [QUOTE]difference of opinion[QUOTE] with the College.
They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were... persuaded to leave.
No! Someone help me! Please!
By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over!
Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!
I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!
I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to her! To the Listener!
What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?
It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!
Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?
So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just... the Night Mother's body?
And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener... just spoke. Right now...
...to you?
By Sithis.
And... what did she say?
Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is.
But Volunruud... that I have heard of. And I know where it is.
Volunruud? Well, that is interesting. I know this place...
No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that?
The Night Mother may have spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not have my authority so easily dismissed.
I... I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir - do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.
But... What of Yamarz?
I see. He did not survive. He... He died well?
What? Why would he do such a thing?
Ah, that is good to hear, then.
Yamarz was a coward and a weakling. His deceitful ways have cost you all greatly.
So he has been punished? And what of us? What fate shall we suffer?
You'll have to prove yourselves, but I'm willing to give you a chance. Gularzob's in charge now. Let's hope he's a better chief.
You, place that hammer on the shrine. You're the only one who's proven worthy in all of this...
You have done admirably, little one.
You have helped rid the Orcs of Yamarz in a way that avoids the destruction of their tribe.
They will become stronger for it. And you... You have proven your strength.
You have earned my favor for now, mortal, and so I give you a little gift. Use it well.
Frantic, maddened
Absolutely not. That wing has been sealed for hundreds of years, and for good reason. They say the ghost of Pelagius the Mad still haunts it.
Ghost or not, there are reminders of his dark rule that are best left buried away.
Not on your life. It's dangerous in there, and Falk doesn't even like me and Erdi going in every year to clean out the spiders.
Oh, I'd get in trouble for that. It's not allowed. Besides, it's scary in there!
Well, perhaps it's time for some independent study.
Check with Urag gro-Shub in the Arcanaeum. See if he's aware of any references to this... thing that you and Tolfdir found.
I'd like to know as much as we can about it.
How could you just leave me here?
Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?
I've got to get out of here.
Why did I ever come here?
Please! Help me!
Urag can be very helpful. Just don't antagonize him.
Well, you're certainly making a name for yourself.
I understand you're the one that found this... Orb in Saarthal.
You have what you came for. Now leave.
Take your books and go, before I change my mind.
Do we have a deal?
This thing from Saarthal. What does it do? J'zargo cannot say.
I hear you found some... thing in Saarthal. You think it could help make me a powerful mage?
We shouldn't have been disturbing Saarthal, no matter what you found down there.
At least something good came out of that trip to Saarthal. I didn't find anything but dust.
Welcome to the Midden.
Is it true? One of the Psijics was here in the College?
No one's heard from the Psijic Order in so many years. Hard to believe one would just suddenly show up here.
J'zargo regrets that there was no chance to speak with the Psijic Monk.
You must excuse me. I shouldn't be here.
It is good to meet you in person.
I hope you have good news for Mirabelle.
Please, make sure Winterhold is safe!
Well? Is everything out there all right?
Find Savos, and get him back here if you can!

What have we gotten ourselves into now?
Well, this certainly won't help our image.

This can't be happening!
Protect yourself! We're under some kind of attack!

We never should have brought that thing here!
I hope this isn't something I did.
If this is somehow your fault...
By the gods... what was that?
We need to find out what Ancano's up to.
I don't know what he's doing, but he won't get away with it.
I trust that you'll inform me as soon as the Staff is recovered.
I hope Mirabelle is helpful in locating the Staff.
So you're off to find some staff now? I don't see the point of that.
very sly
Have you managed to track down the Synod, or the Staff of Magnus?
Please, tell me you've found the crystal. I've no wish to die in this place.
Unless you can find that crystal, there's no point in wasting more time with talk.
It's very important you do this correctly.
We've got to find a way to put a stop to this.
I hope whatever you're going to do will work.
You'll defeat Ancano, won't you?
What are we going to do? How do we save the College?
I hope you know what you're doing.
I can't lose all my research. There has to be a way to save the College.
You really think the Staff of Magnus is the key?
How long can we keep this up?
J'zargo knows that you will save the College. You must.
J'zargo is sure this is the end. And this was supposed to be a safe place...
If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?
I've never seen anything like this, in all my years.
Can you imagine the kind of power behind this?
We never should have pulled that thing out of Saarthal.
Do you think Ancano knew all along what the Eye was capable of?
This is going to be terrible for business...
You're still alive!
Get to the College, before it's too late!
What are you doing here? You need to get that Staff, or else we don't stand a chance!
Our order will not forget your deeds.
You have done the world a great service.
Now what's going on?!
Psijics? Here now? What in Talos' name...
I knew you could do it!
We must hurry if we're going to defeat Ancano.
Gods, you'd better have something good up your sleeve. I've got nothing left.
We never should have brought that thing here...
I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.
If only we'd stayed out of Saarthal.
I can't believe any of this is happening!
J'zargo is going to stay right here until this is all over.
If only Savos were alive to see this...
To Oblivion with the rest of them - save yourself!
Why doesn't someone do something?
I'm not ready to die. I'm just not...

Fine, then wait here. This should only take a second.

Yamarz has fallen. It is now up to you to return the giant's hammer to Atub.
The tribe may yet survive, but only if you are willing to do what is right.
Yamarz has revealed himself as a coward and a schemer, and has earned the fate of all who follow that path.
Take the giant's hammer to Atub, and tell her what has happened here.

We're so grateful for your help.
What're you looking at?
I know this place looks horrible -- please don't hold it against the Company.
A very powerful family in Windhelm.
They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves.
Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.
Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that.
They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron.
She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.
If it were to somehow end up in my hands, I wouldn't argue.
We used to think the pirates had an army of battlemages at their side.
As it turns out, it was just one. Haldyn. I've since learned more about him.
The most dangerous sort of man -- quick to anger, but patient in exacting vengeance.
He also has a fearsome control of Destruction magic.
I wish you the best of luck.
Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too - the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days.
It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do.
The old tales tell of Dragonborn heroes who slew dragons and took their power.
It seems those tales are true.
With the dragons returning, and now a Dragonborn appearing... maybe the Greybeards know what it all means.
It means you can kill dragons and steal their power - even speak with a dragon's voice, they say.
as awed as Galmar can get
I don't know much. Only the old tales about the ancient heroes who would use the Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim.
They say the Emperors used to be Dragonborn, but that all ended when Martin died during the Oblivion Crisis.
The Greybeards can tell you much more than I can. They're the masters of the Way of the Voice and taught Tiber Septim himself.
The only thing I remember is the old story of Tiber Septim being called Dragonborn by the Nords, before they switched sides and joined the Empire.
No doubt those Greybeards up at High Hrothgar will talk your ear off about it.
They live in seclusion on the slopes of the Throat of the World, the great mountain of Skyrim.
They're masters of the Way of the Voice. If you really are Dragonborn, they're the ones who can teach you how to use your power.
Near as I can tell, a bunch of ancient Nord hermits who live on top of a mountain.
musing -- maybe they aren't just a bunch of old kooks?
They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice - of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World.
If you're really Dragonborn, they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon the Dragonborn for training.
Ulfric can tell you more than most anyone. He was studying to be a Greybeard himself, back before the Great War.
In the old tales, Nord heroes would use the power of their Voice to Shout down the gates of cities and strike down their enemies.
But only the Greybeards study the Way of the Voice any more. If you can Shout... you need to talk to them.
Old Nord folk tales always talk about Shouting their enemies to pieces. I always thought it was just a myth.
If you think you might be able to do that kind of thing, the Legion could certainly use your help.
Go talk to the Greybeards, see what they can tell you.
Well, I only know what I've heard in the old tales. Shouting is an ancient form of magic - the use of one's voice to project their power.
If you can Shout, you need to go see the Greybeards. They'll know what to do.
I know more than most. I trained with the Greybeards at High Hrothgar when I was a boy.
The Way of the Voice is an ancient, spiritual form of magic in which you project your vital essence into a [QUOTE]thu'um[QUOTE] or Shout.
Most people would need to train for years before they could even attempt a single Shout.
The Dragonborn is different - you have an inborn ability to Shout, the same way dragons are said to.
All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else.

I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride.
However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed.

You found me! Laelette was trying to find me too, but I'm glad you found me first.
Laelette was told to burn mommy and me, but she didn't want to.
She wanted to play with me forever and ever.
She kissed me on the neck, and I got so cold that the fire didn't even hurt.
Laelette thought she could take me and keep me, but she can't. I'm all burned up.
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for a while now.
Now there's a mystery.
She ran away when the war started. Her husband, Thonnir, was devastated. No note or nothin'.
I'm pretty sure she up and joined the Stormcloaks.
Grief stricken
I thought Laelette left to join the war. I hadn't heard from her since she left.

Speak with Ulfric, he's expecting word from Whiterun.
Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcomed those... shunned by society.
Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten year-old vampires... what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked.
Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways... simply are not our ways.
He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.
Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years.
If you say Cicero has gone there, it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground.
Tread carefully.
Should have figured Astrid would send you.
wounded, it's hard to breathe
What gave it away?
coughing - he's laughing through a really painful wound.
Yeah, got to admit that little jester is good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got.
In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase.
All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'd be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep.
Pained and wounded. It hurts to talk.
Kill me if you must. But I can't promise I won't haunt you till the end of your days if... if the Dread Lord lets me. Ha ha ha ha ha.

This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while.
Places where you can overhear things. See things.
And the Whispering Lady.
I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do.
That he worries about being chased from Whiterun.
That he... that I'm...  that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.
She won't tell me her name.
I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me.
I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets.
But I can't open the door.
In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it.
I bet she'll talk to you, too.
Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly.
But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore.
The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role.
First, you must open this door.
A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals.
I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.
Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly.
Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid.
Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!
I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...
Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?
Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you.
She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just... just rest.

I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life!
But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right.
After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild.
Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down.
You must be the one Falk spoke so highly of. Welcome.
You've returned! I'm hoping successfully.
You know what needs to be done. Is there something more you need?
The courier must have found you.
Speak to Styrr. He can help.
I won't be able to relax until I'm sure Potema is dealt with.
Sure is. I've got another client -- wants me to do some enchanting. You can do the pick-up for me, if you want.
There's more enchanting to be done. You can acquire whatever it is and bring it back here, and I'll take care of it.
All right. Be quick about it, will you? This is a good way for the College to bring in some money.
Here's the name and location of the client.
Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece.
Ah, you're from the College? I've been waiting for you.
Please make sure this arrives in a timely manner. And don't scratch it up.
Oh, good. I've been waiting for you. Here you go, it's all ready.
Now, Sergius knows what I want. I'm hoping he can get it done quickly.
It's about time someone arrived. Here, make sure this is handled properly.
Oh yes, that. Here you go. I hope this can be ready soon.
Yes, yes. Let's keep our voices down, all right? Just make sure this gets there.
I need some more supplies. Can you help out with that?
I'm running low on Petty Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Lesser Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Common Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Greater Soul Gems.
I'm running low on Grand Soul Gems.
If you can bring me three more, that would be helpful.
I need at least five more, if you can find them.
Bring me another seven of them, if you can.
Ten more would keep me stocked for a bit.
In fact, there is. I need a soul gem filled, if you're up to it.
Here, take this Grand Soul Gem, fill it for me, and bring it right back. I'll be waiting.
Some other time? That's not going to help me much, now is it?
Ah, yes. Thank you. I'll get to work on this right away.
I'll add it to the list of things I need to take care of. Thank you.
Excellent. Thank you, I'll see that this gets put to good use.
Yes, a Grand one. Soon, please.
If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations.
There are more books to be recovered and secured here in the Arcanaeum.
Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful.
Ah. Some other time, perhaps?
I had to use your pay to smooth things over with the client. They didn't want to be associated with a criminal. Next time, don't get arrested.
Gettin' pinched and endin' up in jail doesn't cut it with our clients. If you want to get paid next time, stay clean.
Yeah, your right. Probably a waste of your time anyway.
Sure, no problem. We'll find someone else to do it.
Don't even give it a second thought. Maybe next time.
A bit afraid to say this
Consider it forgotten, boss.
Are you bloody serious? You're not going to get ahead by quitting around here, that I can promise you.
You can't keep quittin' jobs when it strikes your fancy. You're going to make us all look like a bunch of amateurs. Think next time.
Keep droppin' these jobs and I might quit assignin' them to you.
Being connected to a criminal didn't make the client happy... next time, act like a real thief and don't get caught.
Good going... you got arrested. Now how do you think that looks for the Guild? Better luck next time.
Good. Here's what you need to do.
Fine. Here's everything you need to know.
All right. Take this and get out of here.
Fine. Just keep it clean. Here you go.
Good, just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second. Now take this and go.
Here you go. Hope you don't muck it up.
Here. Just don't make me look like an ass in front of the Guild and mess it up.
Whatever, just get it done. Here's the job.
Oh, you're back? I suppose you'll be wanting your pay then.
You did the job and you did it clean; that's all we ever ask. Enjoy the gold.
Didn't muck it up I hear. Good. Here's your share.
I suppose you want your share now? Here you go.
And with no strings attached. Not bad. Here, got some coin for you.
Amazing what people leave laying around for us to take, isn't it?
Fine. I guess you'll need your coin then.
Here's your gold. Try not to spend it all in one place.
No problem, I'll get someone else to take it.
Fine. Next time, save me the trouble and pass on it from the beginning.
Make up your mind, will you? You're starting to make us look bad.
First you take the job, now you don't even want it. I wish you'd make up your mind.
You've done a great thing, today. It doesn't matter who you support in the war; Potema would have been a blight on the land for both sides.
Without you this would have been a disaster. I should have paid more heed to Varnius' warnings.  I won't make that mistake again.
Ready to get moving?
So, what's the plan?
We heading out?
Whenever you're ready to leave.
You're ready to get going?
Shall we get moving?
We going?
Ready to get going?
You are ready to move, yes?
We are leaving?
Waiting.
Still standing here.
Mara protect us both.
I'm itching for a fight.
Still here.
Lead on. I'm behind you.
To Oblivion and back, as they say.
Ours is to follow, friend.
Khajiit guards your back.
If anyone sneaks up on us, I'll smell them coming. Or I might not. We'll see.
An Orc follows to the death.
My blood's calm. I prefer it boiling.
You have a grim look.
We've stopped. What is it?
I'm still here.
No! Not again! I shall not be denied again!
Potema herself? Please tell me you stopped them.
Any resident of Solitude can tell you, she was the deadliest person ever to come out of Skyrim.
Queen of Solitude, granddaughter of Emperor Uriel Septim II, five hundred years ago. Her fight for succession nearly tore the empire apart.
After twenty years of fighting, she had raised armies of the dead, led by vampire generals. If she returns to power, nobody could stop her.
A curious figure. Unrepentantly evil and nasty, of course, but also astonishingly brilliant, and obviously quite a necromancer at her end.
She was always so close to being Empress, but despite her machinations, it was never to be hers.
Ironically, if she were alive today, she'd be the only living member of the Septim bloodline. By all rights, she would now be Empress.

A likely story. They won't even do their own dirty work now, eh? Well, you won't get the better of me!
Now tell me where my brother is!
No? So you don't know anything about my brother?
Then what are you doing here?
Thorald... Thorald Gray-Mane? Fighting for the Stormcloaks, disappeared and believed dead?
You really don't know anything about this, do you?
Because they've got Thorald locked away somewhere, and if they find me here I'll disappear too!
I am not going to let that happen!
I can't do this all on my own. Are you... are you offering to help me?
What's there to say? You go against the Empire, you wind up dead. Thorald got what was coming to him.
Between the two of us, his family is better off thinking he's dead.
Thorald and I have history, all right? We used to be friends. So I looked into it when he disappeared.
I found out the Thalmor have him. And they don't let anyone go.
So I've kept my mouth shut. Like I said, his family is better off believing he's gone, because he's never coming back.
He fought on the wrong side, and he paid for it. That's all I have to say.
Oh come on, leave it alone. He's gone. There's no use in talking about it anymore.
I wish everyone could just get past that and get on with their lives.
It's been a while now. I miss him, but it's clear he's not coming back.
He knew what he was getting into. I don't... I don't blame anyone.
I used some contacts in the Legion, asked some questions. Was told I should mind my own business.
Last I'd heard, he'd been carted off to Northwatch Keep. Ever heard of it?
If you go in there, you don't come out. Ever.
Here, see for yourself. This is the last word I received. I'm telling you, he's gone for good.
Oh no. No, no, no. This can't be happening.
Please, you can't tell anyone. It must remain a secret! I'll do whatever you want.
What makes you think I know anything? Everyone knows he's dead and gone!
Okay, okay!
All I know is that Idolaf made some effort to find out what happened to him, but was told to stop asking questions.
He got some letter from the Legion and has left it alone since then.
I'll prove it to you, all right? I'll get you the letter. Just... meet me at the statue of Talos, and don't tell anyone about this.
That's privileged information. Now move along.

I'll round up what men I can, and meet you outside Northwatch Keep. We'll get in and out as fast as possible.
Well, well. I was looking for this little beauty.
If you happen across any other unusual trinkets like this, be sure and bring them to me. I promise it'll be worth the effort.
Here you go. This should cover it.
I think you'll find this payment to be more than fair.
Really? And what might that be?

And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus?

I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything?
I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done.
This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you now.
A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself.
I certainly do.
Since you went so far as seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.
Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?
I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you.
I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it.
They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.
sarcastic, disbelieving
But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of.
Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes.
But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt that it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure.
The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.
The Augur?
concerned, surprised
Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years.
My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic.
I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me... uneasy.
It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power.
No one here does.
The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all I remember.
It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why.
I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative.
Mother's calling me. It's time for me to sleep now. I'm so tired. Thank you for making her feel better.
Who's there? Is that you, father?
<humming>
Have you found proof of Alva's treachery?
Is Hroggar innocent or not?
You better get proof of your accusations against Alva.
Any word on that fire?
I hear the steward asked you to look into the fire.
Have you found out anything about Alva?
Have you seen Laelette? Have you seen my wife?
She's dead. Laelette is dead.
Now I'm going to have to kill you!

Helgi. But father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Are you a stranger?
I remember you. You're the stranger. Father says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
The smoke woke me up. It was hot and I was scared, so I hid.
Then it got cold and dark. I'm not scared anymore.
But I'm lonely. Will you play with me?
Like I said. It got hot and smoky. Now it's cold and quiet.
I wish someone would find me.
You know him?
He made my favorite dolly, but I can't find her.
Are you sure you aren't a stranger?
Don't you remember? His name is Hroggar.
Okay! Let's play hide and seek. You find me and I'll tell you.
We have to wait for nighttime though. The other one is playing too, and she can't come out until then.
That's cheating. We're playing hide and seek. You have to find me before Laelette does.

Soldiers! They're everywhere these days. And not a one of them knows how to pick up after themselves.
My poor Fralia thinks Thorald's still alive, but I know better.
Whiterun belongs to the true sons of Skyrim now, just as it should.
We Gray-Manes got just as much to be proud of as them Battle-Borns, but you won't see us with our noses in the air.
Got of lot of steel to shape.
I ain't much for talkin'.
Why you still starin' at me?
Never much cared for that Balgruuf myself. He was in the Empire's pocket, so to speak.
My Eorlund is the finest blacksmith in Skyrim, and that's not just a wife's boasting.
I can't stand those braggart Battle-Borns. They think they're the gods' gift to Whiterun.
Eorlund and I... we both miss our son terribly. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.
I...I miss our son terribly, especially since Eorlund died. Thorald... he went missing, fighting the Imperials.
Oh, I always knew my Thorald was alive. Ain't a man in Skyrim who can keep a Gray-Mane down.
Everyone thinks Thorald is dead. But not me. I know my boy is alive out there. Somewhere...
Confident, certain
It's not easy being a woman in Skyrim, I know. But stay strong, and men will come to respect you, and maybe even fear you.
What's the matter? You can't stand the sight of a strong Nord woman?
I miss the days when the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns got along. Ever since the war started, we've been at each others' throats.
There's nothing a man can do that I can't do better, whether it's serving drinks or slaying trolls.
The daughters of this land are just as strong and loyal as its men.
You wouldn't know it now, but the Gray-Manes and Battle-Borns were once fast friends.
I enjoy this work well enough, but I'm ready to retire. I've been thinking of selling the inn to Ysolda. Anyway, what do you need?
What can I get you?
Hungry, tired, or just plain thirsty?
I'm just out and about, love. The Bannered Mare can do without me for a bit, I suspect.
I don't get much time time off from the tavern, but I enjoy it when I do.
I'll get back to the Bannered Mare soon enough. Just need to stretch my legs a bit...

Want to hear a little Nord wisdom? You don't really know a woman 'til you've had a strong drink and a fistfight with her.

Most of our weapons were crafted by Adrianne Avenicci. My woman's an artist, is what she is.

Whiterun once again belongs to its rightful heirs. It's a glorious day for Skyrim.
We Gray-Manes have been feuding with the Battle-Borns for years. There's no more bitter enemy than an old friend.
When the Empire surrendered to the Aldmeri Dominion, they shamed us all!
The people saw fit to name me Jarl, and I don't intend to let them down.
You're lookin' at a real warrior! At least I used to be.
Look at you! Betcha think you're something, huh?
For thirty years, I served the Legion as a commander. Fought in the Great War.
Vignar and I have our hands full. It's no small task, running an entire hold.
When I became Steward, I had to give up the bottle. The people of the hold need me at my best.
I'd be dead if not for Vignar. He took me in and helped me turn my life around.
I had a bad time a few years back, an' I turned to drink. But Vignar, he wouldn't let me stay weak.
Oh, I'm just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I'm sure.
I've been tending to the warriors of Jorrvaskr for as long as I can remember.

Damn those Gray-Manes to Oblivion. They want to back the Stormcloaks, they'll get what's comin' to 'em.
Avulstein Gray-Mane and I were best friends as children. If I see that traitor again, I'll throw him in jail myself!
The cold, frightening truth is that the Empire represents progress. Anyone who fears progress is a coward.
The Stormcloaks are content to live in the past forever. No wonder the Provincials think we're all baseless savages.

You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.
People have forgotten humor, poetry and romance. I love a good sword fight as much as the next man, but there's more to life.
It's my desire to enter the Bards College. My parents are hesitant, but I pray they let me attend.
All I want it is to escape from this madness. And if Olfina can come with me, all the better. But I've probably said too much.
It's no fun getting pushed around all the time...
I don't know what you did, but Braith won't even look at me now! So thanks!
My friend Olava? The seer? She says things will get better for me, once I start sticking up for myself.
I can't fight. Not even a little bit. My family thinks I'm a little milk drinker.
By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?
Maybe some other time I'll reveal your destiny, hmm? Tea leaves, palm reading, crystal scrying... Oooh! Maybe trepanning? Ha ha ha ha.
Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood.
Oh, I tell the future, all right. When I feel up to the task, that is. But I'm afraid my energies haven't quite peaked yet today.
I've got a hungry daughter to feed, so selling my produce is really the only thing I care about.
I hope you're looking at me like that because you want to buy something?
I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work.
Did you know there are some fruits that actually grow better in the cold weather?
You'd be surprised how much work it is selling things at a stall. It's not all standing around and chatting.
Praise Talos and all the Divines! Whiterun has been liberated by the true sons of Skyrim!
You have come! You have come to hear the word of Talos!
The Imperials silence us because they fear us! They are cowards! Cowards and fools who have forgotten the truth!
There are those who would silence the Dragon's truth! But not I! Not Heimskr! His word will be known!
The truth, child of Talos, is that the Dragon's children have come! To purge the world in fire and righteousness!
He has returned... Oh, how Talos has returned. Helgen has been purged in his light. Will Whiterun be next?
Once I've made enough money trading with the Khajiit caravans, I'm going to buy the Bannered Mare from Hulda.
I spend a lot of time at the market stalls so I can learn the merchant's trade.  I need more experience if I'm going to run an inn someday.
They say there's nothing a Nord woman can't do if she puts her mind to it.
We Nords are strong, and we're as tough as stone. But I'll bet you didn't know there's some of us with a good head for business, too.
obviously smitten
I just want to go home and read.
Excuse me, but I'm trying to read.
Nothing like a good adventure or romance to lose yourself in.
I import books  whenever I can. Most Nord works are too bawdy and violent for my tastes.
My daughter Braith says I read too much. [QUOTE]Play with me, mother![QUOTE] Girls need to learn how to take care of themselves.
Really, I wish my girl would read more. It would certainly keep her out of all those fights.
If you'll excuse me, I really just want to get home.
You tried mercenary work? It might suit you.
Sometimes I miss the soldier's life, but when I hold my daughter in my arms, I know I made the right choice.
My wife's a good woman. She can be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I love her just the same.
My wife was a good woman. She could be a little hard-headed sometimes, but I loved her just the same. Gods I miss her.
What're you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder.
Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there's nobody I won't fight!
I don't fight Lars no more, if that's what you're worried about.
Stupid Lars Battle-Born. I fight him almost every day, but it's not much of a fight, 'cause he don't fight back.
I spend so much time among the dead, I sometimes forget how much I miss the company of the living.
With this terrible war, I'm a bit overwhelmed. As are the catacombs.
As Whiterun's priest of Arkay, I spread his word whenever I'm able. In the meantime, most of my hours are spent with the city's dearly departed.
I ain't done nothin'.
What? Why you lookin' at me?
That Heimskr's crazy. Him and his talk o' Talos. Wish he'd just shut up.
Emphasis on [QUOTE]my[QUOTE]
Oho! And what do you want, hmm?
You can't kick me out of here. You want me gone, you're gonna have to kill me.
Now I don't care about no deeds, or laws, or other nonsense like that. This house was empty, so I settled in. And now it's mine.
I'm a generous man, to those who treat me right. Might be I'll even let you live here with me, if you mind your manners.
Hello, child of Kynareth.
Lately it seems I am more nurse than priestess, tending to those who have suffered, both in mind and body, from this terrible war.
These are trying times for us all, I know. Many come to the Temple of Kynareth to pray, and I assist them as best I'm able.
Come to chat with an old woman, hmm? Do your good deed for the day?
Looking for a horse? I own these stables, but Skulvar can help you with a purchase.
Do you like horses? You  should visit the stables. I own them, you see. And our stock is excellent.
My friend Maven and I - have you met Maven, in Riften? - we know our place in this world. Know the place of others, too.
Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying - of course you don't.
Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously.
I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head.
There's a nip in the air. Cold won't be good for my crops. Never is.
I own the Pelagia Farm, just outside the city walls. Nimriel takes good care of things for me.
I had my years of war and fighting. Senseless, all of it. All I want now is a rake and a patch of good soil.
Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the [QUOTE]great warriors[QUOTE]?
It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me, I prefer my books, and my spells.
There's a tranquility in magic, don't you think? It is simply energy, to be harnessed by those with the will and knowledge to do so.
Got some good pieces out here, if you're looking to buy. More inside.
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane's got that honor. Man's steel is legendary. All I ask is a fair chance.
I don't claim to be the best blacksmith in Whiterun. Eorlund Gray-Mane was that and more, but now he's dead. All I ask is a fair chance.
Have you met my father? He's the steward, up at Dragonsreach.
Have you met my father? He was the steward, up at Dragonsreach when Balgruuf was Jarl.
I help my father in more ways than people realize.
You think all the council my father provides the Jarl is his alone? Hmph. Let's just say I advise the advisor, and leave it at that.
Be warned, the Jarl is in a foul mood since the Stormcloaks overran Whiterun.
I serve Jarl Baalgruuf as steward.
The Jarl is, as you can imagine, very busy. Perhaps I can assist you?
The task of Steward is more important than you realize. The Jarl often asks for my invaluable council.
I'm kept so busy, I don't get to see my daughter as often as I'd like. Perhaps you've met her? Adrianne? She owns the shop, Warmaiden's.
Steely, ominous, and angry. he is really pissed.
You should be talking to my Steward.
I'm the Jarl, not a barkeep. Speak your business.
Quickly now, or would you prefer I let Whiterun fall to the Stormcloaks?
You might be a guest in Dragonsreach, but you're starting to try my patience.
What is it that you need?
You have my attention.
Speak your mind.
It pleases me to see you again.
All this standing around is rubbish. We should be taking the fight to the Stormcloaks.
I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me, and point me at the enemy.
My brother takes council from Proventus Avenicci? What a laugh. He takes council from his daughter, and she's a bloody blacksmith.
I'm the commander of the guard here in Whiterun.
My boys'll keep you safe. Don't you worry.
You're not thinking of causing trouble here in this beautiful city, now are you? 'Cause I'd strongly advise against such foolishness.
I'll always be a commander, even if those Stormcloak dogs have stripped away my power.
The Legion will regain control of this city. Mark my words.
I'm commander of the guard, now.
The Stormcloaks can keep this city safe better than those Legion lapdogs.
The security in Whiterun is terrible. Shameful, is what it is.
The guards in this city are all lazy and undisciplined. Things need to change...
Commander Cauis walks around Dragonsreach like a preening rooster. I could do his job blindfolded....
You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household.
We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not.
Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.
It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us.
giving a scary, understated command
Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching.
Got the fleetest steeds in all o' Skyrim.
Gal like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.
Man like you needs a warhorse, I reckon.
Only thing better than ridin' a swift horse is ridin' a swift horse over the enemy.
Lookin' to shatter records or bones? My beasts can do both.
Need a horse? Talk to my father, Skulvar.
Old lady Maiden-Loom owns the stables. But my father and me, we run things.
So I mostly sweep and shovel. You got a problem with that?
Father says I ain't smart enough to be stablemaster. Some day.
My father never thought I was smart enough to be a stablemaster. I just wish he was around to see me now.
Come to gawk at the dark elf?
I mean no offense. I am but a humble farmer, not a great wanderer, like you.
Slightly drunk, maybe slurring just a bit
Careful if you cross the river to the east. Old Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his brigands are holed up in that cave, White River Watch.
The circle of stones to the southwest? That's Secunda's Kiss. The giants hold it sacred, so tread carefully.
You know, I saw something near Shimmermist Cave, to the northeast. Some kind of creature... small and wicked. Never seen its like before.
If you're heading east, steer clear of Hillgrund's Tomb. Thing about those old crypts - the dead having trouble staying that way.
Looking to do some hunting? Avoid Brittleshin Pass. It's southeast of here.
Yesterday, I saw a dragon fly right over the city. Headed northeast. Toward Shearpoint, by the looks of it.
Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall.
You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can.
Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready.
Need a blade? You should talk to Adrianne, at the forge.
Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock.
If you need potions, you should try Arcadia's Cauldron.
Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come.
I worry about the other settlements in the hold. Unwalled, lightly manned - prime targets for those damned dragons.
Rorikstead's a nice enough little hamlet, but a boring posting for a guard. If a dragon attacks, well... then it'll be a different story.
You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent.
Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself.
On top of the Throat of the World is a patch of snow that's never melted.
They say the Greybeards taught it to ignore the sun, and heat simply washes over it.
The original Phial was made from this snow. We'll only need a small bit for the repairs.
The ivory produced by those beasts is as hard as iron. But the giants have found ways to make it yield.
They're able to grind it down so fine that it can be infused into the lattice of packed snow.
The finished material has the delicate nature of fresh powder snow, but the strength of the hardest steel.
The final tempering of the Phial was performed with a type of old magic that's been lost since the Dragon War.
The nearest modern incarnation of it is the strange rituals practiced by the Forsworn.
With the heart of one of their Briar Warriors, I can lock the Phial's magic into its physical form.
It's difficult to explain to the layman -- forgive me if I begin waxing alchemic.
Figures -- I doubt you have sufficient knowledge to harm the Phial even if you wanted to.
Either way, this is the end of it.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm not quite in the mood to entertain guests. I trust you can show yourself out.
Here's for your trouble.
Command me, my Listener.
Anything you need, Listener.
Oh yes, Listener!
sound of a dog barking
Show me.
Yes, my Thane?
It shall be done.
Of course. Right away.
With pleasure, my Listener!
sound of a dog happily woofing after being told to do something
Okay, got it.
It will be done.
As you say, it will happen.
Then that is my task.
No problem, I'll handle it.
Oh Listener. Can't you see that's impossible?
Sorry, Listener. It can't be done.
If only I could, Listener.
sound of a dog whining pathetically
Can't do that. Sorry.
Not possible.
That can't be done.
Can't do it.
No. Not possible.
I'm sorry, that can't be done.
We are devoted to the Goddess Mara, who gave mortals the gift of love that they might have a hint of eternity.
Her blessings are many. To love is to know the true nature of the gods.
Are you the one sent by Mara?
I'm sure I know what this is about.
She thinks she's in love with Bassianus and wants to leave town. With him.
Let me tell you how I see it.
Until a few months ago, the girl was head over heels for Klimmek. Wouldn't stop talking about him.
Now if I thought she was really in love with Bassianus, that would be one thing. But she's a child.
It will pass.
Oh, my love. How I long to take her away from all of this.
Why did Boti send you to me?
Oh, Fastred. I'm not sure what happened. One moment she's smiling at me, the next I can't even meet her eyes.
I'll bet Bassianus would know what's going on. He understands women.
Are you prepared to receive my golden words?
Wonderful. I'll write it out so you won't forget it.
Hmmm. I don't think you've got enough to cover my expenses with Silver-Bloods, much less convince me give my words away.
Come back when you've got the gold, then.
Pardon me?
This is... more than I could have hoped for. Have you really done this for me?
I have to see her. Please, excuse me.
Not all can hear the broad echoes of deepest dawn.
To receive the touch of Mara, you must first act as her hands in the world.
Explore the facets of the infinite jewel.
The dawn surely opens upon you, child. You must bear its light that all may see.
In a reverie
clarifying, coming out of a vision
This is the prayer heard by the goddess and relayed to her servants. Return when she has seen her path.
I will entreat Mara on your behalf.
May you carry the warmth of Mara to all corners of the frozen wastes.
I prayed to Mara and she spoke to me in a dream. She said a stranger would appear to help me.
Is that you?
My parents are being impossible.
Bassianus wants to marry me. And I think I love him. But he wants to move to Riften afterwards, and my father won't allow it.
He only cares about this stupid town, but Bassianus makes me happier than anyone ever has.
My mother's not any help, either.
Oh, thank you so much! It's wonderful to have someone around who understands.
You know how children are. Her fancies change with the moon.
And like always, the boy lacks any kind of spine. He'll need some convincing.
A little push and this would all be simpler.
Look around here. There's not much left.
Used to be a good-sized town, but folks have been moving to Riften for a while now.
If all the young people leave, what happens to Ivarstead?
Oh my. Probably something about the men. We all wish we had her problems.
Now, don't tell my husband, but I don't have any problem with Bassianus.
Even if it means her leaving Ivarstead, I want Fastred to be happy.
If they just snuck out of town together, I could manage my husband.
What did you call me?
Ysmir's beard, you're right! No fish was ever caught by staying away from the shore. I'm off to see her!
Fastred, I have something to say to you.
Klimmek? What is it?
I don't want you to leave Ivarstead.
Why not?
Because... I would miss you.
But I thought you only cared about your fishing!
What good are fish if you have to eat them alone?
Oh, Klimmek...
Fastred, we must speak.
Bassianus, sweetie, what is it?
We must leave. Your father will never approve of us, and I grow weary of this place.
Where will we go?
To Riften, my pet. How you'll adore the city.
Oh, and to be with you!
I always had a feeling she liked me. More than that brute Jofthor, at least.
Jofthor... what about him? He'll come after us and... it will be unpleasant.
The trouble is that I can't seem to speak around her.
My mouth goes dry, and I start to shake.
I could never hope to approach her.
Then you know what a beauty she is.
Well, suffice to say she is resplendent, but not without resolve. Striking, in all senses.
Faleen... I...
Sssh. It's all right. You don't need to say anymore. I had no idea you were so... nuanced.
I love you.
So I hear. Come here, you.
I'm not sure what this is all about.
This is... lovely. Calcelmo wrote this... about me? I never knew he had such feeling in him.
Clearly. I've never even thought of him in that manner. I wish that I was as skilled with words as he.
Here, take him this letter. I may not be as eloquent as he is, but I hope he understands.
The goddess smiles at your efforts, child. The dawn shines bright upon you.
You have seen the young, fickle love of youth, and helped a more seasoned love find its way.
There is one final aspect we wish for you to explore. For a strong love can withstand storms and even survive death.
Take this symbol of Mara. She will guide you to the wandering souls of two whose love was so great that their entwinement binds them to this world.
Nothing else? I'm always eager.
That everything?
Is that all?
sound of a dog happily panting
Anything else?
Do you need anything else?
That it?
Anything else before you go?
Now wait a minute, Listener. Even Cicero has his limits! Not many, mind you... but I do have them...
I won't do it. You ask too much.
But Listener... Are you sure? I just can't bring myself to do it...
sound of dog growling in anger
Not for you. Not for anyone.
Even Khajiit have their limits. No.
Maybe you want to rethink what you're asking?
I will not drag my honor through the mud for you, or anyone.
Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do something like that. Even for you.
Your efforts have helped illuminate the entire province. I trust by now you've achieved a higher comprehension of love.
Carry the blessings of Mara with you, so the rest of the province may shine with her glories.
J'zargo is listening.
trying to lighten the mood
Name it.
dog barking expectantly
All right. What is it?
Go ahead. What is it?
Fine. What?
Yes, Thane. What is it?
You want me to do something or not?
Do you have any orders?
Still something you'd like me to do?
Did you require something of J'zargo?
Did you still need me for something?
So, did you still need my assistance?
dog happily panting, waiting for your command
Still need me to do something?
Do you still need me to do something?
You wanted me to do something, yes?
You still wish something of me?
Still have something you need?
I'm on it.
Right away.
dog woofing happily
Let's see it.
Point the way.
Let us see it, then.
As you will.
Okie dokie, Listener.
All right.
dog barking in acknowledgement
Your call.
Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.
Life's hard enough with all these men propositioning me. But that bard is the worst.
We're used to getting by on scraps, but the Shatter-Shields want everything for nothing.
Poor Roggi. If you're feeling charitable, buy the Nord a mead. He's good for it.
Ranmir beg a drink from you, yet? That's gold wasted, friend.
You a fighting man? How about a little bet?
You a fighting girl? How about a little bet?
Think you can go blade to blade with me? You'd be dead in six seconds.
You. You a Dark Elf lover? Get out of our city, you filthy piece of trash.
You damn gray-skin. Go back to Morrowind!
I'm the best warrior in Morthal, and that's no boast.
The corn stores are getting low again, Orgnar.
I still need you to make a batch of those fried potatoes. We can serve them with the ale.

It's about your singing. Well, not your singing, your songs. But you know what I'm talking about.
sighs, like he's accepting his fate
Wonderful. And let's not have this chat again next week. Agreed?
Lucan, we don't sell silver buckles, do we? One of the customers was asking.
We don't sell any imports from Summerset Isle, do we, Lucan?
Lucan, I was thinking we should have a grand sale. Lower the prices by half, maybe get some jugglers. We could attract lots of new customers.
No, dear sister. We do not.
I'm afraid not.
Hmm. All right. Do you think... maybe we should?
Well, I was thinking... we should. We could stock all kinds of specialty items. You know, to cater to some of our more.... [QUOTE]eclectic[QUOTE] customers.
emphasis on [QUOTE]new[QUOTE]
That's really not at the top of my list, no. Please, Camilla, I need you to focus.
Dear sister, we talked about this sort of thing before. We sell dry goods, nothing more, nothing less.
Camilla, really? You don't have better things to do? Because I could certainly find quite a few tasks...
Of course, Lucan. Of course. I was just, well... Never mind.
Okay, okay. Just trying make this place a little less... boring.
I know, I know. My head's in the clouds again. Just... forget I said anything.
Can I make something now, papa?
Is it time yet? Time for me to make my sword? Or maybe... an axe?
I'm bored standing around, papa. I could take over for you...
Later, little one. I need to finish what I'm working on. But keep watching. Watch, and learn.
He he. Not just yet, Dorthe. I need to keep forging, and you need to keep watching.
Patience, Dorthe. You'll get some time at the forge, I promise you. But not right now. You need to keep watching me. That's how you'll learn.
Don't worry, I am.
All right. But I am getting a bit tired of waiting.
Dorthe, dear, I've been growin' some really lovely vegetables. Maybe tomorrow you could help me plant a new patch? What do you say?
Dorthe... I was thinkin' I'd knit a couple of blankets, sell them to Lucan. Would you like to make one? Might be fun, workin' together.
You know, Dorthe, with all those vegetables I've been growing lately, I was thinkin' we could make a right lovely stew. Together. How about it?
awkwardly getting out of something
frustrated/sighing
It's just that papa promised I could make something at the forge. So maybe we could do something together, hmmm... next week? Is... that okay?
Just stop trying to change me, mother! I'm not a baby anymore! I'm almost a woman! I... I can't be who I want to be!
I'm sorry, mother. I can't help it. All that stuff you like to do, it's just so... boring.
Ho, now... Keep me out of this...

Sighing, exasperated
Well. I can see your father and I are going to have to talk about this. And when we do, things are going to change.
Hey boy, I heard you nailed a Septim into Lucan's doorstep. Damn near drove him crazy. That true?
Tell me, son. Any truth to these stories I been hearing. About you gluing a cow's udders shut? You really do something like that?
Heard me a rumor, boy. Something about you putting bugs in the stew over at the Sleeping Giant. You do this?
Sure I did. And I'd do it again.
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I sure did. It was one of my best pranks yet, father.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's my boy!
Ha! I knew it! Had your name written all over it, that one did!
See, now that's what I'm talking about. Working hard, making your mark on this world. Good job, son.
He he he he he.
You just wait. My new pranks are going to the best ever! You'll see! He he he he.

You mean the Dragon Bridge issue? I'll be honest with you, I was planning to let that go. Varnius is a bit jumpy at the best of times.
The cave has a bad history. Long ago, Potema the Wolf Queen used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name.
That was over 500 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.

There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful.
The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing.
The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.
As you may be aware, the College has gone to great lengths to purify and enhance the natural energies of the world.
This both enhances our connection to the realm of magic, and eliminates possible interference from outside sources.
These energies, on occasion, become... polluted. Effort must be made to see that they are kept pure, clean.
Do you wish to aid in this cleansing?
Very well. These specially enchanted gloves will allow you to delve directly into the focal points for these energies.
Go to each focal point and remove whatever impurities you may find there.
Return the gloves to me when you have finished.
Please exercise caution. This is not a procedure without possible... consequences.
Use the gloves to clear the focal points. Return to me when you have finished. I thought I made this rather clear.
I see.
Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most.
Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.
Mara will protect you.
I'll wait here.
I'll just be here, then.
We'll be waiting, then.
I will wait.
I'll be right here, then.
I'm ready, let's continue.
All set, let's go.
You lead, I'll follow.
Let's get going, then.
We follow, then.
Khajiit will follow.
Lead on, friend.
May the Hist guide us.
Let's tread softly.
Lead. I'll follow.
casual prayer while on the road
Lead us to our next task.
Lead on, then.
Following.
Here you are. Now remember, people in Skyrim respond to deeds. You will find more people interested in your love if you help them.
Good luck. Mara bless you.
Lost the last one I gave you? Very well, here you are. Mara keep you.
I'm sorry, but even Mara's Temple needs coin. We will have a symbol ready for you when you come back with enough gold.
You've embarrassed the temple and spat in the face of love. What do you want?

The Sybil of Dibella spends her entire life in direct communion with the goddess.
From the time she's a little girl to the moment she expires, she is a direct connection with the heavenly mother.
From her reverie, we know the mind of our god.
We have had a vision of the next Sybil, living in a village to the north. She must be brought to the temple for her reverie to begin.
It's considered a great honor for the family. Their daughter will never know hardship, and the goddess blesses them with great bounty.
We prefer not to announce that the Sybil has died until we can introduce the new one. People like to know that we're connected to the goddess.
You, my dear, can earn the Blessing of Dibella. You'll find men to be more pliable in the future... or more vulnerable.
Have you heard of the Blessing of Dibella? It can help you with the wooing of women, if that's your aim.
Or give you strength if you happen to offend one.
Typically we avoid bestowing it upon men, but for the Sybil's escort, we could make an exception.
Our daughter, Fjotra, was taken from here. The Forsworn descended and... they didn't touch anything else. Just our little girl.
It was the Forsworn from Broken Tower. Never been much trouble before. What's it to you?
She... really? That's... I wouldn't have dreamed. Of course, we need her in Markarth, then. I'll come with you.
That's... that's good of you. If you were to save her, I would be very grateful. I don't think there's anything I could give you, though...
My mother's been haunting me ever since she died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad she's here.
My father's been haunting me ever since he died. At first it was a little strange, but now I'm glad he's here.
A parent should never outlive a child. Having my son's spirit here... it's as if he never died.

I'm worried about my daughter. I'm keeping an eye on her for a little while before I pass on.

We got everything in hand here. You aren't needed 'round here.
We chop trees, we mill the wood. What more would you want to know?
It's a hard way to make a living, but we find ways to make ends meet.
We don't take kindly to people snooping around our business.
These axes can chop a lot more than wood, you know.
Hey, welcome to the mill!
My brother and me bought this place when we left the army. Boy, did we lose a bundle, but at least we're not fighting the war!
We're making our money back, bit by bit. Every extra bit of work helps...
We served our time in the Legion. Now we're just trying to make it day to day.
I used to serve with Trilf and Steirod. Good guys, but don't get on their bad side, you know?
I once saw Steirod tear a whole tree out the ground with his bare hands. Glad he's on our side!
These boys do good work for the Empire!
Nice to be here on the home-front. Wouldn't mind being down in Cyrodiil, though.
Ha, enjoy the Chill.
You'll never see the sun again. No one escapes Cidhna Mine. No one.
It's off to Cidhna Mine for you.
You're going to rot in the Dragonsreach Dungeon.
A stretch in the Castle Dour Dungeon will straighten you right out.
I guess you're smarter than you look.
grimly - emphasis on the first word, [QUOTE]that[QUOTE]
grimly, but with a smile.
You aren't fooling me. Trusted witnesses have seen you commit several murders.
And there are accounts of your suspicious behavior throughout the city. Now come quietly.
threatening but happy, in a sly way
Good enough. I'll just confiscate any stolen goods you're carrying, then you're free to go.
hardly daring to hope
I feared as much. I thought it was him we saw flying east after your battle.
Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you...
There is one possibility. But... no, the Jarl would never agree.
Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace?
Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.
Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago.
Before the Blades wiped them all out.
a bit eagerly -- getting into this idea
firmly and seriously
Well, yes. This is rather embarrassing, but it seems I've misplaced something.
I can't find my Alembic. I suppose I could use another one, but... well, it sounds silly, but mine has sentimental value.
If you happen to see it, would you mind bringing it to me?
I seem to have misplaced the book I was reading.
My Alembic. I need it for some research, and can't seem to find it.
A book of mine. I was at least halfway through, and wanted to finish it, but apparently I put it down somewhere.
Deliver the message to the warring parties. If they will listen, I will do what I can to bring them to terms.

Although I fear the Jarl may not be easy to persuade.
Remember, the Way of the Voice trains you for more than battle. Indeed, we believe that battle is the least of its uses.

It's Grelod!
If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again, are we clear on all of this?
I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?
Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.
Very well, I trust that you wouldn't be here were it not significant.
I... see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more... specific explanation.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes?
Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject.
Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is aware of anything that matches your discovery.
And... good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful.
Damn it, man, are you trying to taunt us?
Damn it, woman, are you trying to taunt us?

talking around something he doesn't want to mention
I thought Enmon and Mean had a little girl, but I haven't seen her in a while.
I think you might be looking for Enmon.
And what's that have to do with me?
Yeah, we're all looking for something.
Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?
You... you found her? I can't believe it. Let the girl come with me and we can begin her preparation.
I will send word to her family that she is in good hands.
You've truly earned the Blessing of Dibella, child. Prostrate yourself before her altar, and she will bestow her gift.
Hold on, now, we only want to...
Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!

grudgingly
Come with us. We need to get out of here.
Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!
gruffly
Grab what you can, and let's go.
calling, spitefully
Aye, a whole heap of it. You see that Temple? Way up there?
All them women, keeping to themselves. Won't let poor Degaine in, no.
Not even for a look.
But they've got a treasure in there. Gold statue, size of a child. Who knows what they use it for, but I know what I'll use it for.
Well let's not put it like that. Wouldn't want the Thieves Guild catching wind of us, eh?
Nah, just creep in and have a go at taking it out. I'll be here, and pay you half of what my man in Riften promised for it.
You'll be helping out an old beggar, and the Divines smile on that sort of thing.
The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd.
And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all.
The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time.
Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins...
Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.
I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself.
I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry.
How in the world did that happen?
Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?
Hold, mage, and listen well...
Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped.
Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing.
emphasis on [QUOTE]will[QUOTE] -- it's a warning
This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you.
You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster.
Take great care, and know that the Order is watching.
I... I swear I felt something rather strange just then.
What just happened?
I'm afraid I didn't see anything...
Can you tell me more about what you saw?
Hey! What're you doing in here?
Get out of here or I'll call the guards!
That's it! You're leaving, right now.
You look new. I'm new, too. I think we could be friends.
If you're looking for opportunities to make some coin, well... I'm your man.
Everyone needs work, right? I have good work for you.
I believe you know what needs to be done. Something about putting out a fire?
Looks like you had no trouble.
Get moving. I'll see if I can't delay any patrols out there.
I knew you looked like a clever one...
Turn me in? For what? What crime's been committed? I'm just making idle talk about what would most undoubtedly be a tragic event...
A tragic, and very, very profitable event.
The effects have already been felt. The Icerunner has failed to dock on time.
Without the Lighthouse, the Icerunner will have swung wide of the western shoal and run aground on the eastern coast.
My sister Deeja will be at the wreck with our Blackblood Marauders. She knows to expect you.
Don't worry about them. We'll make sure they wash up safe. Maybe they'll even pay us for the heroic rescue from their sad crash.
Hroggar's house? It burned down not too long ago.
It's a real pity about his wife and kid. The screams woke half the town.
Most folk won't go near it now for fear it's cursed.
Do they? How delightful!
I'm lucky to have a man that is so devoted to me.
Hroggar's house? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
The townsfolk won't go near it. Superstitious lot.
Hroggar's house fire? Aye. He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
My people believe it to be cursed now. Who am I to gainsay them?
Hroggar's house fire? He lost his wife and daughter in the blaze.
It's bad luck to talk about that place.
Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.
Hroggar claims it was a hearth fire. Some folks say Hroggar started it himself.
Bear fat in the hearth fire, if you believe Hroggar.
I do, but some folk here think he set the fire himself.
Hroggar blames his wife for spilling bear fat in the fire.
Many folk think he set the fire himself.
That's what they say.
See, he's living with Alva now. That started the day after the fire.
It ain't right, movin' in with a new love the day after your kin die like that.
They think he did it to get rid of his wife so he could be with Alva.
He moved in with her the day after the fire. Even I find that suspicious.
Lust can make a man do the unthinkable.
The ashes were still warm when he pledged himself to Alva.
Aye. Our Jarl would sure like to know if he did though. Might even pay to find out.
Can't prove it. But I could use your help, being unbiased and all.
See if you can find anything in the burned out house.
I'll pay you to figure it, whether or not he's guilty.
On rumor and gossip? No. But you, a stranger, might find the truth for us.
Sift through the ashes that others are too fearful to touch. See what they tell you.
Should you prove him guilty or innocent, I will reward you.
Susanna's the third. It's always the same: young girl, killed at night, body torn up.
Seen it before. Disturbed, but no longer shocked.
It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade.
Bristling at the accusation that he's ineffectual.
Mistrusting, dismissive
I'm going to examine the body before the rats can get to it.
The [QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] is sarcastic.
You'll need to talk to Jorleif, though. We can't just let anyone go around claiming to be on official business.
If he's willing, then we'll talk.
I'm sorry -- she was very dear to me, and it's rather painful to think about.
I'd rather not talk about my daughter, if you'll excuse me.
Well... all right. What exactly do you need to know?
I've had enough troubles recently. What is it that you're after?
Good day.
Hjerim? Well, I'm not sure what you think you'll find there, but you're welcome to have a look.
They say they're too busy with the war -- I say what good is winning a war if we're still terrorized by one of our own?
Oh, they care all right. Just none of them thinks to do anything about it.
They say I'm just snooping around bothering people, but I'm trying to save lives!
I've been trying to put those up around the city, to warn people. Have them keep their eyes open.
But someone keeps taking them down.
You say you found it in Hjerim? Friga's old place. Let's go have a look around there.
I've got a feeling about this one.
I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets.
Might even give you a bit of gold for it.
He's lying. This is really a magical artifact of great power which he had and misplaced. He's attempting to throw the player off the track of the mur
Traditionally it's carried by the court mage.
He wants this badly, but doesn't want to tip his hand as to how badly.
For a piece like that, I could pay... 500 gold?
The Wheelstone? Have you decided to sell it, yet?
I'll meet you over there.
Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here alone any longer than I have to.
Emphasize private -- he considers this to be highly valuable. It's more important that he has it than that others see it.
Wuunferth? Bah. It's purely ceremonial, and he has no use for it.
Besides, I wouldn't want to be the one to give it to him. Gives me the creeps. They say he dabbles in necromancy.
Suit yourself. It's only of value to collectors, though. Good luck finding anyone else who will appraise it that highly!
Wuunferth. There have been rumors swirling about him for years. As long as I can remember.
But he's a dangerous man. It's why they call him [QUOTE]the Unliving.[QUOTE] I wouldn't approach him directly.
Emphasize [QUOTE]you,[QUOTE] contrasting that he would *not* listen to Viola.
I don't want to believe it. Wuunferth has been a trusted friend to Ulfric for many years.
It pains me to see that the whispers had truth to them.
Wuunferth shall be apprehended. I thank you for your diligence in getting to the bottom of this matter.
The streets of Windhelm are now safe.
What made you think I was to blame in the first place? I've actually been after the killer myself.
More of those things. Bah. Viola Giordano's been putting them all around the city.
Frankly, whoever keeps taking them down should get a medal.
Oh, Friga Shatter-Shield's old place?
Well, since she's not using it anymore, Ulfric might just let you have it, if you have the money. And if he likes you.
Or you could head over to the family and see if they'll let you in. But I wouldn't want to do that myself. Bad luck over there.
Doesn't mean anything to me. Got an unusual shine to it, though.
I'd take it to Calixto. He's got a good eye for pieces like that.
I don't know if I've ever seen any of those before. I've heard about them, though. Sorry, can't help you.
Sorry, I don't know anything about those kinds of things.
Not very good quality, is it? Probably came from the Gray Quarter. Have a talk with Revyn Sadri.
He usually knows what's going in and out of that place. Thankfully that means I don't have to.
Looks like something one of the dark elves would wear. Ask Revyn Sadri, he probably sold whatever it used to be.
Nothing anybody I know would wear. Maybe ask one of the Dark Elves, they usually have some kind of rag falling off of them.
The one who sells things, what's his name. Oh, yes! Revyn Sadri. Maybe he'd know something.
Of course, of course. But such things are valuable, and usually falling apart anyway.
I don't see why someone would actually use them.
Although... that court wizard does all manner of experiments. And I know he owns some truly strange things.
Nobody else would even know which end to hold.
If I were you, I'd go straight to the steward with this information.
Oh, good, more of those.
Did you know Viola Giordano wanted to put one of them on my front door?
[QUOTE]Everyone will see it![QUOTE] she said. Of course! That was my problem with it.
If you want to ask her about them, good luck. But I'm not going near her.
Are you joking? Even I wouldn't sell something like that.
They definitely have some magic in them, I can tell you that much. But it's nothing I know about.
How goes the investigation?
Any luck finding the Butcher?
Please, tell me you have good news.
Mmm hmm. Anything else?
Now that's interesting. Tell me more.
Good observation. What else?
Well, come back when you have some more evidence. I think you're on the trail, though.
That's absurd. Come on now.
So what do you think about it all, then?
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right.
Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing!
They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!
Dismissing the ridiculous notion of a wheelstone, then realizing the implication of someone falsely identifying an artifact to frame him. Final sente
very suspicious, putting together the puzzle
The same kind of resignation we saw in Gandalf when he realized what the Ring was.
That is the Necromancer's Amulet, of legend.
It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this.
Eehh.. Calixto and his books are often confused about such matters. It happens to the best of us.
I've been noting a pattern to when the killings happen.
Now that we know they're tied in to some sort of necromantic ritual, I think I know when the next might occur.
Doing calculations in his head during the ellipsis.
Keep watch in the Stone Quarter tomorrow night. That's almost certainly where the killer will strike next.
Come, Legate. There's much to do.
Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.
This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf.
Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich.
You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say.
Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.
a wink and a nod
Let me show you the operation, then you can ask your questions.
It's just this way. Keep following me.
Keep following, it isn't far.
Go, leave me in peace.
Let's wait until Brynjolf's here before we begin.
They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame.
Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business better than a huge column of smoke.
Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal.
Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was... well, angry to put it kindly.
So we send in Vex and find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.
Hmph, yeah I did. That wood elf s'wit... he's a lot smarter than I expected.
Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must be eight of them in there.
It was like he was daring us to come and get him.
You did this didn't you? I'll get you for this!
I haven't heard even a scratch at the door. Have you done it?
What is it now? We have a tasting to attend to!
Was something we discussed unclear?
I can't believe that worked.
I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm.
Can't a man drink in peace?
I believe Brynjolf wishes to speak with you. We're done here.
I trust you have good news for me.
Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?
About time you showed up.
anxious to hear the news
I'm certain Maven wishes you to be in Whiterun, not wasting time here.
Maven wants to see you right away. I suggest you head right over.
I'll never submit!
Do your worst, monster!
I won't bend. Never!
I'll see you back in Riverwood.
groan of pain
Let's get out of here.
Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?
No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.
Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon.
If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it.
Ha. I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.
I just cook, and clean, and do whatever it is they ask of me.
I can't even keep track of all the people who have been in and out of this fort. They come, they go. I barely notice.
Hard enough to keep up with who owns this fort. One side takes over, the other runs away. I tell them, [QUOTE]I ain't leaving! I come with the place![QUOTE] Ha!
I remember one morning, long time ago, I woke up and the place was run by some Orcs. Went to bed that night, it was all vampires. Don't matter to me.
Now, then. I been gabbin' long enough. Too much cleanin' to do.
Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow - whatever you feel is best.
Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus.
Me? I like to talk to my targets before the kill. Taunt them, scare them... even challenge them.
That can have interesting results. Some victims may flee, others may cower in fear.
Help! Get that beast out of my house!
It's still here! Get it out!
Get that thing out of here!
Thank you! I thought that beast would be the end of me!
No? I daresay we don't have all day.
Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here.
I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.
What... What was that? Everything seemed to shimmer for a moment.
What happened?
And here we all are. Shall we step inside?
What could this place be?
Be prepared to defend yourself.
This is simply fascinating.
Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.
Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?
Who knows what we might find in here.
You know, there might be gold somewhere in here.
To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed.
I'm not seeing signs of any warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago.
This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?
This is exciting, isn't it?
I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.
Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here...
I'm not so sure we should be here.
I find it hard to believe this excavation was approved.
Don't touch anything!
It's going to take forever to sift through all this.
I'll be amazed if we find anything useful here.
Well, certainly none of this will benefit my research...
Well, are there any questions before we begin?
Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds.
I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins.
Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.
Find Arniel Gane. He's somewhere in the northern section of the ruins. He'll show you what to do.
Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do?
Brelyna, my dear, why don't you search for warding magics. Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them.
Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any... residual energies. Alive or undead.
J'zargo... what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs.
All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun!
What? Why? I don't understand... I have done nothing to wrong you. Please, mercy!
What? You dare challenge Ma'randru-jo? You will suffer for your insolence!
Why are you still standing around here? Go get me the Phial, you fool.
Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus.
This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder.
Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me.
But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone.
Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away.
The scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it.
For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.
Who do you think brought Septimus here? Who do you think protected you on your journey to open the box and loose my knowledge on this world?
Your free will is an illusion. Whether you acknowledge me or not is your own business. But I will be in your mind.
Here's what I can spare.

Now, how would you like me to align the Phial's properties?
I'm not as skilled as Curalmil, so I'm afraid it will only ever refill with one type of liquid.
It's just one of those things that happens. The lungs just... give up. Even elves get old.

But to answer your question, the White-Gold Concordat was the fancy name they put on the peace treaty between the Empire and the Thalmor.
It ended the war and saved the Empire to fight another day.
Also trampled on the sacred name of Talos, and gave the Thalmor free reign to stamp out Talos worship throughout the Empire.

Assur had to move away because of the Empire. But we get to stay.
The mages don't let us go in the College. They said it's not safe in there.
Assur says his pa says the College made lots of bad things happen, but the mages I've seen look nice.
Assur and I are playing a game. Don't tell him where I am!
There's not many people left in Winterhold, so I only have Assur to play with, and sometimes he's mean.
Assur always wants to play [QUOTE]Hunt the Elf[QUOTE] and he makes me be the Elf.
Pa says the Empire made us leave, but the Empire just does whatever the elves tell them to.
How come you're in Winterhold? My pa says people like you are the reason no one lives here anymore.
[QUOTE]elves[QUOTE] with disgust
My pa says elves are bad and not to trust 'em.
Did you know that most of Winterhold fell into the sea? I heard it's because of that College.
Someday I'm gonna grow up and be the Jarl.
I heard the College teaches you how to kill people with magic. Is that true?
I'm just the Housecarl. If you need something, you should speak to Kraldar.
I'm very busy, you know. I'm the only one Kraldar can rely on to assist him.
Kraldar's family was once very powerful in Winterhold. It's my honor to assist him even now.
Kraldar has big plans for Winterhold. We'd be better off if he was in charge.
Some people can't be trusted to accomplish anything that's asked of them. They don't take pride in their work.
I'm not one to complain, but I'm not sure why Kraldar insists on keeping Malur Seloth around.
Thonjolf is convinced I've got some connections at the College, so he goes easy on me.
I don't really know anyone at the College. I guess everyone just assumes I do because I'm a Dunmer.
People won't say it, but they're afraid of me, so they leave me alone.
It turns out that if people think you're some sort of secret wizard, they'll let you get away with a lot.
I'm trying to do as little as possible. You're getting in the way of that.
With the Empire's help, Winterhold will be back on its feet in no time.
There's yet hope that our relationship with the College can be repaired.
Winterhold may not look impressive, but it has a very rich history.
Winterhold was once the capital of Skyrim, you know. Quite an honor.
I'd like nothing more than to see Winterhold regain its former glory.
It's hard to recover from something like the Great Collapse, but I believe Winterhold can do it.
The College of Winterhold is truly an asset to our city... err, town.
self-important
Just say the word if you need a drink or something to eat.
We may not have as much to offer as Whiterun or Solitude, but we'll do what we can to make your stay a pleasant one.
Winterhold doesn't offer much, but we like living here. Been here all our lives.
If you're here for the College, don't let the folks in town bother you. Just try and keep to yourself.
The Mages at the College keep to themselves for the most part, so we don't see much of them.
Most of our business comes from folks traveling to and from the College.
If you need a drink, just say the word.
Something I can get for you?
If there's anything you need, just let me know.
If you've business with the College, you're welcome to stay here. It's where most of our business comes from, in fact.
Unlike some folks here in town, we have nothing against the College or the people that come and go.
Don't worry about Nelacar. He has a permanent room here at the Inn, but he keeps to himself and doesn't cause any trouble.
Let me know if you need anything. We're here to provide.
Without us looking out for Winterhold, it's doomed. Simply doomed.
I'd rather see the Sea of Ghosts swallow Winterhold entirely than have it run by the Empire.
Ours is the only family left that truly cares what happens to Winterhold.
Korir will be the first to tell you that if it weren't for that College, we'd all be better off. I agree with him.
Winterhold might yet thrive if that College had never been built.
We do the best we can, even though we have next to nothing. But we Nords don't give up, not ever.
Assur is going to grow up to be a great man, because he'll have lived through such hardship.
You know Winterhold used to be the seat of power in Skyrim? Now it's a shell.
Few will admit it, but we know the truth about the Great Collapse.
Those cursed mages... It's their fault Winterhold is gone.
The College is the worst thing that's ever happened to Winterhold, maybe to Skyrim.
You want something?
Empire's in charge now, huh? Only a matter of time before we start getting bothered by them Thalmoricars... err, Justimors... Y'know, them elves.
Unless you're bringin' me another round, you can just keep walking.
I'm just trying to have a quiet drink here, all right?
It's not like there's anything to do here but drink anyway.
You ask me, not enough of Winterhold fell off into the sea.
Nothing to do here but drink till you forget you got nothing to do.
I'll sell just about anything, if it's worth my time. Keep that in mind, will you?
I do what's necessary so we can get by. Have to, since I can't count on my brother for anything.
Things are easier now that I don't have to worry about Ranmir anymore.
I still can't believe you were able to help Ranmir pull himself together.
Without all our money going to drink, I can afford to expand my selection a bit.
If you're looking for Ranmir, he's either passed out in bed, or working on winding up that way.
My brother's a good-for-nothing drunk. We'd have lost the house by now if it were up to him.
Just because we live in the middle of nowhere doesn't give Ranmir the right to drink himself into oblivion.
Ranmir has no problem drinking himself under the table, so I have to be the one to make ends meet.
I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking.
My days at the College are long behind me, but I prefer to stay close by.
Dagur and I have an understanding. He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn.
If you're here for sight-seeing, well then you've seen the sights. Might as well head somewhere warmer.
Don't worry about those Stormcloaks. You're safe from them here. As if they'd want the place anyway.
Keep clear of the College, and keep yourself out of trouble.
Hard to believe I ever complained about Riften being cold...
Take care if you're venturing too far from town. That's a bitter wind coming off the Sea of Ghosts.
Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages.
Traumatized. He truly felt he was safe and this latest murder has shocked him to his core.
You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?
[QUOTE]Obviously[QUOTE] is a mixture of deadpan and angry.
Sarcastic, mocking.
Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.
I'm glad you were able to correct your mistake. I'll release Wuunferth immediately.
Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected...
We need to get back to Jorrvaskr.
A smart man came and told us about a blade piece.
Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you.
One of those icebrains who wanders the land getting people's hopes up.
From my view, I don't think we'll find anything here.
You'd better hope there's still a chance for you to prove yourself, though, or this Trial might last longer than you'd like.
He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.
He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him.
whimsically
She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter.
He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire.
The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself.
He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in all of Skyrim.
Apparently so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client.
He's an Argonian layabout, likes to scavenge shipwrecks. My guess is he'll run if threatened. Or swim, if given the chance.
He's an accomplished wizard. And, locating him may be challenging, as he travels with the caravans.
The wood elf may run a stall in the city, but he retreats to the plains outside Whiterun to hunt. Kill him there, and no one will bear witness...
She's a maid. Old, and feeble. But with this contract it's much more a matter of [QUOTE]where[QUOTE] than [QUOTE]who.[QUOTE]
Your political affairs are your own, but any allegiance you may have in the ongoing war could very well affect your access to Fort Greymoor.
He's dangerous. Very dangerous. A rogue Dark Elf mage doing research into Dwarven artifacts should be both respected... and feared.
He's the housecarl of Falkreath. You know what that means? He's the bodyguard to the Jarl himself. So be careful.
Ah, yes. The pirate captain. A ruthless she-devil, by all accounts. Deadly with a blade.
And let's not forget her crew - loyal and bloodthirsty, the lot of them.
This is my final contract, and certainly the most challenging. Be careful with this one, my friend.
No! Oh, by the gods, please no!
Oh... Oh no... Please, please... I ain't never harmed no one... Old Narfi just wants to be left alone...
Do... do you want something? Look, if you ain't gonna talk, or spare no coin, just go away...
What? What do you mean?
Oh! Oh... no... No!
Aiiiiiiiieeeeee!
Who are you? You... you're with the Dark Brotherhood, ain'tcha? I knew it. I knew you'd come for me!
And let me guess, that someone is my so-called husband Leigelf? Well the feeling's mutual.
What? Well, we'll see about that now, won't we?
I've a mine to run, so if you'll excuse me...
Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!
Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals.
Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death...
Leave here. Leave here and never return.
Ha! Oh, that's a good one, friend. Killing Lurbuk... I mean, can you even imagine something so ludicrous? Depriving the world of my unique talents?
Hmm... All right... How about this?
Singing
Brilliant, I know. It's a gift.
What's the matter, friend? Khajiit got your tongue? Maybe you need a little ditty to loosen your gob, hmm?
You'll have to catch me first!
Go away! I don't know who you are, but this is my spot! Whatever's on that ship is mine!
Emphasis on [QUOTE]friend[QUOTE] -- says it threateningly
Now aren't you a strange one. Well, if you're here to shop, shop. If not, find some other caravan to stalk.
Are you... threatening me? Walk away fool. It's not worth it.
Is that so? We shall see, villain. We shall see!
Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that...
But I have many more rooms to clean. Fort Greymoor is quite large, and rather filthy if I do say.
Sleep? I can't sleep now! There's too much to be done. And what's this Void you're rambling on about?
I swear, you people are an odd bunch. Please, just step aside, that I may return to my duties!
Death? Oh, there's death to be found here, to be sure.
But not my own!
Yes... quite. But if that power could be harnessed. Controlled. The possibilities would be...
But... who exactly are you? And why are you in here? I think it best you leave Mzinchaleft. These ruins can be quite... dangerous.
Who are you? Why are you here? Leave this place. I have much work to conduct....
And why would I... Oh. Oh! Guards! Guards, I need assistance!
Fiend! You will not leave here alive! Guards! Guards!
Right. Well. If you have some kind of official business with the jarl, I'm afraid now's not the time. Go on then. Off with you.
The Dark Brotherhood? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think this is the first contract I've had on my life?
I'm a pirate, sweetie. Assassination attempts are an occupational hazard. Now, shall we?
finishing the player's sentence
Okay, here's how this works. You try to assassinate me, and I kill you. Horribly. I have done this dance before, you know.
Ah, I see. The old Dark Brotherhood [QUOTE]silent intimidation[QUOTE] treatment.
Oh, I know who you are. Don't be so surprised. You ain't the first assassin sent to kill me. Won't be the last. Now let's get this over with.
I have some thoughts. There are three crucial elements. Some may be easier to find than others.
On the top of the Throat of the World is a patch of Unmelting Snow. No heat can touch it.
Then we need the tusk of a mammoth, ground to a fine powder as only the giants know how.
The final step is tricky. It requires the briar heart from a Forsworn of the Reach.
If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole.
You've shown yourself useful so far. All these lunks are too afraid of Haldyn to head in before the fog's cleared.
So if you're willing to perform one more service for the Company, we could put this matter behind us for good.
Take out Haldyn, and we'll handle the rest.
The one who calls himself Ancano.
He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different.
His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need.
No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions.
Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed towards something.
It is a good path, one untraveled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further.
You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware.
To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff.
Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.
Ainethach's in charge of Karthwasten. You should bother him.
What do you want? Can't people leave us alone?
Strangers are nothing but trouble.
Karthwasten has enough problems. Leave us alone.
Ainethach's dead, but that doesn't mean we can stop working.
I work in the mines. I hunt. Everything else I do is my business.
These Reach folk are so... nosy.
Ragnar has a strong arm. Pity he isn't an Orc.
dignified but depressed
Ainethach is dead. What will happen to Karthwasten now?
I'm Ainethach's right-hand man. I help supervise the mines.
Not many Nords would work for a Reachman, but Ainethach is a good man.
whiny, lazy
You're not from here, and we don't need to be talking.
You should talk to Ainethach. He's in charge.
Don't have nothing to say to you, stranger.
Karthwasten doesn't need outsiders prying in our business.
The mine is closed. Get lost.
I've been sent by Silver-Bloods to keep this mine [QUOTE]safe.[QUOTE]
Our business is done here.
We're in control of this mine. No sudden moves.
Time to find another job.
whispering/conspiratorial
I'm not going to warn you again.
Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.
Don't do that again. Last warning.
You're pushing your luck.
What's the matter with you?
Stop that.
Hey, be careful!
I'm on your side!

That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?

With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately.
Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.
You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor.
emphasis on NOT
There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor.
Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?
She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness.
I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.
Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased!
disappointed that player doesn't trust you
worried player doesn't believe you
Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire... a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways.
Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others.
The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed.
What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day.
You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body.
Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own.
Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate as to whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina.
I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back.
Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled.
Unless you're here to solve this nightmare problem, I don't need you.
Need a room? Don't worry. Nightmares don't seem to happen for travelers.
You come to Dawnstar at a bad time. Tempers are... fiery.
The Jarl is... tired. Be mindful of that.
These dreams are real I tell you. Real!
Can't sleep well no matter how much drink I put in me.
I envy you travelers. Dreams aren't affecting anyone not from here.
What is it? I haven't had much sleep.
If I get any rest soon, I'll count myself richer than a king.
If you're here about the nightmares, I'm afraid my pleas to the College of Winterhold go unheard.
Seems like no one is getting a decent night's rest in Dawnstar, stranger. Best buy your steel and move on.
Gods I'm so tired.
Please. I must remain uninterrupted if I am to complete the ritual. Have no fear, your time will come.
What troubles you, my son?
What troubles you, my daughter?
Yes, my son, what is it I can help with?
Yes, my daughter, what is it I can help with?
You're wrong to come here, stranger. No rest in Dawnstar.
By the Divines, I'm tired.
No. I don't have anything for bad dreams, so don't ask.
Lady Mara will save us from these nightmares. You'll see.
Wish to converse with the crazy old elf, eh? Very well. Go on.
Apologies accepted. I understand how this entire story can be mistaken for fiction since the circumstances are so abstract.
However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to keep you safe if you're willing to help me.
Amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to continue my research. I have no time for idle chatter with any simpleton who strikes up a conversation.
Thank Mara. I was afraid I'd never be able to convince you.
Allow me to gather the materials I need for my ritual, and then I will meet you outside the ruins.
Let me take a look...
Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum.
It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.
I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample.
Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.
thinking to self
There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done.
I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on.
Farewell, Brother Casimir.
Go now! The orcs could breach the inner sanctum at any moment!
Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives if necessary.
And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?
Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you.
Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!
But... no more than a handful of us remain, brother.
We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.
The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren.
These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.
Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.
There goes another one.
Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.
They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible.
As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be.
You hear that? The others must have found something!
We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.
All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious.
Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full.  Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level.
I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood.
In the southwest reaches of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view.
When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE] Then you're in. And your new life begins.
I'll see you at home.
The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names.
Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing.
Today, she's... well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper.
Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago.
All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit.
Bottom line - respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place.
They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers.
The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client.
But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor.
But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual... and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out.
I don't know who you are, or what's going on here, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
angry and getting panicked, voice muffled, because there's a bag over his head

Thank you! Thank you! I won't tell anyone what happened here, I swear it!
Ah, sweet freedom. Now that's more like it. You have my thanks, stranger.
Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil.
The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation.
I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon.
Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived for so long.

At last. I can rest safely. You have done me a great service, warrior. I cannot thank you enough.
Take this reward. I managed to sneak some of my wealth out of Hammerfell when I left. It's the least I can do.
For now, I will maintain my ruse here. You are always welcome in the Bannered Mare.
Assassins? No, nothing so crass.
[QUOTE]Saadia[QUOTE], as you know her, is wanted by the noble houses of Taneth for treason. We were hired to see her returned to Hammerfell for her crimes.
You can help us with that, and make sure no one else gets hurt.
I'd hoped we could work something out, that you would see reason.
polite, but with a bit of menace
Very well, then. If that's the way you want to play it, we will.
She trusts you, at least to some extent. She sent you after us, and has no reason to think that you'd do anything other than that.
Convince her that we'll be coming for her, and she needs to leave. Lead her to the stables outside Whiterun.
We'll be waiting to take her into custody.
I'll gladly share a portion of the bounty in return for your efforts in seeing proper justice done.
Good. We'll be waiting for you at the stables.
It will be good to finally be able to return home.

What are you on about? Let's just get the treasure here and go.
Some nights I dream about the mists of Sovngarde.
When you get to be my age, you'll come to miss the smell of blood. Strange, I know.
How goes the hunting, brother?
How goes the hunting, sister?
A stranger comes to our hall.
Greetings outsider. If you have some business here, speak it.
Are you still here?
Let's not waste too much time talking when there is glory to be had.
Get a move on.
Haven't seen your face before. I'm watching you.
This is a place for warriors, new blood. What brings you here?
You still need to prove yourself, whelp.
You might make a decent Companion yet.
sarcastic, as if the player can't handle things on his own
This had better be important.
You again?
What now?
I can't keep helping you with everything.
Blood on the wind today. Good hunt ahead of us.
Do you have guidance for me, Harbinger?
I've been running interference for you around here. I don't think anyone's caught on to our little campaign. Yet.
Have you been bringing the battle to the Silver Hand, friend? I wish I could be there with you. Soon enough.
I hope the hunting goes well, sister. We've got the cowards on their heels now.
I hope the hunting goes well, brother. We've got the cowards on their heels now.
I've heard you may actually be stronger than you look. Perhaps we can hunt together someday.
Don't let them intimidate you, sister. We both know how to keep our heads while the men let their hearts rule.
It's good to have another quick-eyed Shield-Sister in the hall. Come to me with any troubles.
If you wish to hunt with me, your feet need to be quick, and your eyes quicker.
Ysgramor himself wouldn't have the patience to deal with all the rabble around here.
Are you on the hunt?
Blood running hot?
You look strong. Come to Jorrvaskr and be a Companion!
Vilkas said you are the new Kodlak. I don't know what that means, but you seem honorable, so that's good.
Skjor says that I have the strength of Ysgramor, and my brother has his smarts.
Some people don't think I'm smart. Those people get my fist. But you, I like.
You are new here. I don't trust the new.
My brother Vilkas is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.
I'm here to help.
Thinking I need to train some more.
Getting tired of hanging around talking all day.
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to be the Harbinger, but Kodlak trusted your judgment. And so will I.
last line said with a chuckle (Vignar is senile/forgetful)
What brings you to me? Find some strange creature in your travels?
I think by now I've killed one of every living thing in Skyrim. May be time for a trip to Morrowind.
Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?
Did you just wander in out of the white?
I suppose you have another question?
You're a talkative one, aren't you.
I swear, every wanderer who shows up in Whiterun looks weaker than the last.
I always thought the new Harbinger would be taller, myself.
Ah, fresh blood. Hope you know how to handle yourself.
I never thought they would actually let me join the Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days.
I avoid going to Eastmarch if I can. Something in the air... I think it's just too close to the border.
Are you thinking you're better than me? I crawled west out of the wasteland, so show some respect.
We are all Ashlanders now, brother. Good to find another family that cares where they came from, eh?
Look, I've got training to get to.
You don't belong here. What do you think you have to offer?
I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place.
If the Circle vouches for you, I'm sworn to respect their judgment. But that doesn't mean I like it.
What guidance could you offer me?
incredibly impatient
disdainful
Fight with us and you'll have stories to tell. Come up to Jorrvaskr if you're worth anything in a fight.
Here to be a Companion? Well, they just let me in, so there's probably no more room.
I was the newest Companion, until you came along. I guess that's ok. Just means I can show you the ropes!
Oh, hey there. I killed a bear yesterday. Did you kill anything?
Good to have some fresh eyes up there at the top. I follow your lead, Harbinger.
Oh, got more to say?
Oh, so you're the one in charge now? Fine, fine.
I haven't seen you before. Have I? Have we met? I'm sorry if I've forgotten.
The latest recruit! Right? Wait, is that right?
Might head down to the meadery later. See what they're brewing up. You can smell the honey on the wind.
What do you want from me, now?
You're a talker, eh?
I don't think we're going to get those potatoes to come in.
Well of course, not with an attitude like that!
The ground is practically frozen. We can't dig down far enough.
Come on, we just need a little elbow grease.
Now, I've been reading about the best ways to grow corn in permafrost...
I keep telling you, without a warming enchantment, it will never grow past your ankles.
Right, but if you plow the soil with fire salts...
Then you've salted it and nothing will grow at all. Genius.
Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that.
I'll bet this is better than trying to grow something in Morrowind, though, isn't it?
Firstly, I've never even seen Morrowind. Secondly, in volcanic soil the plants practically grow themselves.
Oh, my, I hadn't thought of that.
There are places in the world that aren't wrapped in ice, you know.
I was wondering if you had ordered the shipment of that frostwheat, sir.
Yes, but that fool Endario can't get it in. I'll thrash him when I get back to the city, don't you worry.
I wasn't wanting to get anyone in trouble, sir. Just wanting to get the new planting started, is all.
Dripping with sarcasm (this area is a permanently frozen wasteland)
Make sure the back fence is repaired. I swear I saw some skeevers in nibbling the leaves yesterday.
Oh, no skeevers out here, sir. They can't stand the cold.
Maybe, but the way you burn through all that wood to keep the cabin toasty, they might mistake this place for Elsweyr.
Sorry, sir. These old bones do like a bit of warmth in the evening. There's no need to make fun.
You just need to remember that there's a war on, and firewood isn't cheap these days.
So have you ever actually spoken to Captain Lonely-Gale?
By the gods, he's just a retired ship's captain.
Maybe to you, but he's just so... his story is...
He's just a guard captain. And not a very good one, at that.
How have things been with you?
I got another harangue from Torsten yesterday.
Don't worry about him. I know you work hard, and I'm the one who gets you your money.
Thank you, miss, I appreciate that.
And what about the dogs? How are those precious little angels?
Healthy and strong. Ysgramor's coat's gotten so thick, he looks fat!
Oh, that's just adorable.
Tulvur! I've just completed inspection of the farmhouse.
It's filthy in there! Dirt everywhere, and it looks like the dogs have the run of the place.
Well, sir, it's a farmhouse. It's not going to be as clean as your house in the city.
I just know that our sailors are able to keep their ship quarters clean, and I expect the same of you.
I'll do my best, sir.
Sir, I'm going to need some better equipment if you want me plowing the frost.
Like what?
Well, some tools that aren't rusted through would be a start.
I'll provide you wood and timber to make whatever riggings you'll need.
I'm not building a ship, sir. I'm trying to make things grow.
Did I tell you I got a letter from General Tullius? They've conscripted some more archers and will need...
Sssssh! That's not something we want everyone to be hearing.
Oh, like the sleepy rebel supporters in this town are going to tell anyone.
Let's just not take the chance. We can talk about this later.
That last brigade of soldiers said there's a tall forest on the eastern edge of the White River.
Yes, but that's too close to Mixwater Mill. We don't want to get Gilfre angry at us by stealing her trees.
Well we have to harvest somewhere! This is getting absurd.
I want to make money just as much as you do, but we don't want to make the Nords angry.
Who could tell the difference?
We've got a new order in.
Is that a joke?
No! Roggi and Kjeld need some more support timbers for the mine.
I suppose Kjeld asked for the usual discount?
Well, he is the mayor.
bitter, spiteful, sarcastic
What about Ulfric? Did you ever hear back from him?
No, but his housecarl sent us a letter.
Why didn't you tell me? What did he say?
He... thanked us for contacting him, but said they didn't need any more lumber at the moment.
You see? That's why I didn't tell you!
There is some good news though. I think the borders of the shrine may be smaller than we think.
Wait, so you think we'll be able to harvest some of the sacred trees up there?
Well that's just it. Some of them might not be sacred.
I'll let you explain that one to the Nords.
They have to be reasonable about it at some point.
Gemma. This town is called [QUOTE]Kynesgrove.[QUOTE] That stand of trees is Kyne's Grove. You don't honestly think you can just cut some down.
Well, we have to cut down something!
Maybe we should just admit that this is a horrible place for a mill.
I'll never understand why you're so bitter about everything.
I'm bitter because we had lives in Cyrodiil. And we came out here to be paupers.
But we choose our own path now.
And a whole lot of good that's gotten us.
Mama, when can we go play in the river again?
Not with all those soldiers all over the hold. Their horses can't see you, you know.
I know, but...
And you'll be trampled to death!
Please take the Lexicon.
It's yours now. I won't take it back. I won't.
Avanchnzel. Take it to Avanchnzel. You must take it back.
No way. I'm quick!
Well why don't you be quick about finding my book that you lost?
You need to take better care of your sister.
But she's so stupid!
She said you threw her into a goat pen yesterday.
Because she was being stupid!
Don't make me bring your father into this.
I'm going to need your help in the kitchen tomorrow.
But papa was going to take me hunting tomorrow!
Oh, I don't think you're old enough for that yet. You can help me salt the cheese curd.
Why can't Froa do it?
emphasize [QUOTE]you[QUOTE]
Papa, mama's making me do kitchen work again.
And what did you say to that?
She can't tell me what to do!
There you go, son. Be your own man!
And then I told her about the vampires and how much they would pay me for her.
That is rich. What did she do?
She's a girl. She cried.
It's good to toughen her up. Not an easy world out here. Keep at it.
When do I get to go hunting?
Miss Grelod is... well she's a terrible old crone. No person could be that cruel. I think she's part hagraven.
She only lets us out in the yard once. In the morning. And she just stands there watching us.
Like I said. Hagraven.
Sometimes, when she goes to her room to work or sleep, I slip out for a bit. Noontime, every day - that's when I hit the streets.
A boy's gotta make a livin', right?
I hate her. Everyone hates her. She's the meanest person I ever met. Sometimes she even locks us in the... room.
Constance tries to stop her, and is real good to us, but it's never enough.
I ain't afraid of the old hag. Still, I wish Constance was in charge. She treats us real good.
Constance, sometimes she gives me little snacks. Which is good, 'cause we only get but one meal. Late, too, in the afternoon.
I'm a growing boy. I need as much food as I can get.
I will do nothing of the sort. You have no business here. I'm sorry, but you really must leave.
When you're able to draw a bow all the way to your shoulder.
I can do that! I did it yesterday!
skeptical, teasing a child
So can I come?
We'll see.
Have you heard about Goldenglow Meadery?
Did something happen to it?
All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again.
Do the bees need to be happy?
Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!
If you like mead so much, why not go live in Riften?
Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines.
Maybe you could be a taster or something.
Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!
How are the little ones?
Oh, you know. Little Kjeld is a handful, and Froa is just so quiet.
He takes after his father, and she takes after you.
Well, that's the good and the bad of it.
I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...
But don't you get it? She thought he was a troll!
I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.
Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself.
So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?
not exactly sarcastic, but not believing (his friend is a philanderer)
sly, creepy
I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.
That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be.
very uncomfortable with this man's openness with his cheating on his wife
How much do you know about the brewing of mead?
I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine.
I've been trying to figure out what makes Riften mead better than the stuff from Whiterun.
Better honey?
There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from.
I hear Mauhulakh is wandering again. He's after a new woman.
He's lonely. What do you expect?
No matter. You'll take care of things like you always have.
Please, let's not have it come to that.
True... we could simply make sure she never reaches Narzulbur.
That wasn't what I meant.
If he does show up with a bride, we'll have to move quickly.
Once she's with child, I will not harm her.
You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!
Yes, you've made that quite clear in the past. And now we have Urog and Dushnamub because of your weakness.
They are good, loyal children.
Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!
Yes, you. You, who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task - journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre.
What? What treachery! Defiler! Debaser and defiler! You have violated the sanctity of the Night Mother's coffin! Explain yourself!
Speak, worm!
She... spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener!
emphasis on [QUOTE]Listener[QUOTE]
They squander their father's love. We can't dally this time.
Have you scried anything new in the entrails?
Very little. It's an uncertain time.
Not for us, it isn't.
For all of us.
Come back to me when you have something useful.
He's been spending a lot of time at the graves again.
Good. The more time he pines for the dead wives, the less time he spends finding a new one.
Be careful. The spirits can speak to the living if there's a strong connection.
Excellent. Now, you must come with me. You've become a part of this. You must be present for the ritual.
In a Daedra, of course.
Now, we begin the ritual...
Why are we bothering with this?
You pathetic weakling!
What's that?
You dare summon me, Yamarz?
What? What is this?
Bah. He never had a connection with any of them beyond what his loins told him.
You don't deserve to call yourself an Orc! You're weak, you're small, and you're an embarrassment!
You let giants... Giants!... overrun my shrine. Bring me their leader's club as an offering, and I might release you from this curse!
So it will be. Malacath has spoken, Yamarz. Your path is clear.
Very well. You, outsider, come here! I want a word.
Thanks to you, I've just been issued a challenge in front of my whole tribe, by a Daedric Prince, no less. I can't ignore that.
I didn't say I wouldn't fight the giant. I just said you're going to help me get to it.
Meet me outside Fallowstone Cave. You clear the way to the giant for me, and I'll make sure you get paid for it.
This giant... It's not the only thing in Fallowstone Cave. Getting to it isn't going to be easy.
You're going to clear a path to the giant, so I can conserve my strength. I'll make sure you're paid for it.
So you meet me at Fallowstone Cave, and we'll get this over with. I can have my tribe back, and you can... You can leave us alone.
If there's a chance this will save me, then I'm taking it.
I'll lead the way, but you'd better back me up.
Maybe, but...
We're the ones he loves. Me, and you.
Bolar, I must ask you something.
Have the spirits told you where I may find a wife? One who will be safe from this curse?
Oh, all things in time, my boy. All things in time.
What more do you need that Yatul and I cannot provide?
First off, we've learned the location of some rebels scouting our positions throughout the hold. Need to take them out.
First off, there's a couple of Imperials skulking about the hold. Need to cut their throats so they can't make their reports.
First off, they've got some rebels holed up in a nearby settlement. Need to clean them out so our boys can move in.
First off, there's a band of Imperials hiding in a nearby village. We're going to flush them out and put them to the sword.
First, we need to limit Stormcloak capacity and send them a not so subtle message by sabotaging a resource they claim to control.
First problem here is a pack of Imperial dogs drooling over resources stolen from the people. A little sabotage will sour the taste of that victory.
First, we have information regarding the movements of a rebel courier. We need to intercept him and confiscate his package.
First, we've learnt the whereabouts of an Imperial cur fetching documents for his master in Solitude. We need to put a muzzle on that, don't we?
First of all, one of our men was captured by rebels who refuse to surrender him. So we're going to break him out.
First of all, a son of Skyrim rots in an Imperial prison. We'll be getting him out of there soon.
commander briefing a special agent
First, our intelligence suggests one of the rebel garrisons has become disaffected. If we play our cards right, we should be able to turn them.
First off, seems the Jarl's Steward might be vulnerable to blackmail. Need to investigate that possibility.
First off, it seems that we might be able to blackmail the Jarl's Steward. I need to find out for sure.
Secondly, some rebel scouts that have seen too much are moving through the hold. Need to take them out before they report back to their leaders.
Secondly, we got a couple of Imperial spies roaming through the hold. Need to put an end to that.
Secondly, we got more of 'em hiding in a village, using the local populace as shields. Not to worry. We can dispatch them without harming the locals.
Secondly, we plan on liberating a settlement from Imperial hands.
Secondly, I need to cripple rebel production capabilities with a little sabotage.
Next problem - Imperial thieves have, yet again, stolen an important resource.  So we're gonna take it from them permanently - by destroying it.
Soldiers win wars, but where to put them is the key. We have word of an enemy courier in the area. We aim to confiscate his documents.
And then, it seems an Imperial worm wiggles it's way back home, carrying information stolen from us. We need to steal it back.
And perhaps more importantly, I need to break one of our boys out of a rebel controlled fort.
And perhaps more importantly, we have a brother rotting in an Imperial prison. He won't languish in there long, will he now?
And we have an opportunity to slay the rebel field commander. Without a clear command structure, they should fall into confusion and disarray.
We also have the opportunity to slay an Imperial Legate. That'll put fear and confusion into those faithless dogs.
And we understand a rebel garrison is close to abandoning the resistance. We need to send them a little encouragement.
And we hear a handful of Imperials are realizing they are Stormcloaks at heart. We need to send them a little encouragement.
Next, I need a little investigating to confirm the possibility of blackmailing the Jarl's Steward.
Next, I need dirt on the Jarl's Steward. Heard there's blackmail potential there.
(sarcastic) briefing a special agent
I need more children.
fearful for his life
Well, that's a different matter...
Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore.

Then I thank you for showing me mercy. Here, take this coin to him. If it keeps us together, it's worth its weight.

I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city.
Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!
I knew when we were married, this would come between us one day. I don't want to lose what we have, so I'll pay him gladly.
You... you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?

Start out snide, but the illusion is crumbling. You're scared.
Are the gods angry with me?

I'm going to put my neck on the line. We need people like you in our outfit.

Tell you what. You keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?
I look forward to it.
The hags are hateful of anything which grows from the earth. They made the weapon strong against the natural world.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam. Stick it in, give it a twist, and the stuff will just flow out.
It's the only thing I've even heard of that could cut Eldergleam.
Eldergleam's sanctuary grove is to the east of here.
You can use Nettlebane to retrieve some of its sap.
Shall we proceed, friend?
I understand. Some journeys must be taken alone. I'll be here if you change your mind.
Why do you ask me that?
Why else have they cursed me? Killed all my wives?
Perhaps it's actually a sign of their love for you. They don't want to see you with unworthy mates.
Then they should send one they consider worthy.
Patience, boy.
Don't you ever wonder, father?
All the time.
But your aunts don't even seem to care.
They are good women. They love me. You will speak no more ill of them.
I've just never heard of a midwife losing all her mothers like that.
Father, I'm worried about Gadba and Mul.
What about them?
If Ulfric's making a move for Whiterun, then we need to be there to stop him.

We'll let it seem like it's his idea.

You Nords and your bloody sense of honor.
assenting to a slur against her people
You don't worry about two Orc men coming into your stronghold? That they might challenge you?
They're miners. Harmless.
I've just learned not to trust luck around here.
Someday, you can have your own stronghold.
I think it may have to be far away from here.
Oh, if you're worried about me trying to meddle with you...
It's not you I'm worried about.
How is your hunting with Yatul?
We are strong. We get the job done.
I'm proud of you for helping provide for us.
Well someone has to provide around here.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
I was apprenticed to Balimund before he died. He taught me everything I know about forging armor and weapons.
Balimund pulled me out of Grelod's orphanage when I was just a child. I don't know what he saw in me, but I was glad to get out of there.
I've spent years watching his techniques and learning his tricks. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be as talented as he was.
Catchy, isn't it?
In my youth I was a fisherman... I had a beautiful ship named [QUOTE]The Brawny Prawn.[QUOTE] But the years have a way of creeping up on you.
I ended up selling that ship to open this place. Seemed only fitting to name it after her. Well, changed it a bit I suppose.
If I had been smarter, I would have kept my boat. Coming to this city was a big mistake.
Well, then this should be no problem at all for you.
That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.
That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson.
Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go.
I'm trying to pay attention.
After I've finished showing you the grounds, we can talk.
Welcome to the College.
How do you think we should spend the remainder of our classroom time?
If you have any further questions, can you please hold them until I've finished?
Greetings. Welcome to the College of Winterhold.
If it's true, and you do have the Voice, would you mind showing me? I've never seen it first-hand.
Much knowledge lies within the College's walls.
The College is an asset to Skyrim, even if it goes unnoticed or unappreciated.
Winterhold's glory days may lie behind it, but the College lives on.
No matter what, the College will endure.
I don't know what your aunts told you, but...
They're not my aunts. They're your aunts. And they told me enough.
About how the Divines cursed you. What horrible thing did you do to deserve it?
Nothing! I... it's ill fortune. That's all.
Well, your ill fortune means I have no mother.
What I am doing is none of your business!
Why are you here? Did you follow me?
I demand that you leave at once and never speak of this again.
It is none of your concern, I assure you. Just... Forget that you ever saw me here.
I am under no obligation to tell you anything. Now, leave me at once and never mention that you saw me.
Is that so?
I should have expected as much. Fine, I shall give you 200 gold, and you shall leave me in peace.
Now go, leave me to my work.
Thank you. I will not forget this.
Ah, Falion. Always looking where he shouldn't for things he doesn't need.
What has he done now?
I've never trusted him... what has he done?
I... I'm sorry.
Haven't I always been a good father? A good chief?
Yatul and I do all the hunting. Mul and Gadba do all the mining. It seems like all you do is find more wives to get killed.
That's not fair, now.
Ah, so it is not just dreams then. I have seen this.
I will see that it is dealt with. Thank you for bringing clarity.
Is that so? Well, I'll make sure that's taken care of immediately.
It's good that you brought this to my attention.
I see. If something does happen, you know where I am.
Either this is some kind of a joke, or you're keeping something from me.
Whichever it is, I don't like it.
Falion, I am disappointed.
I'm told that you're up to something out in the marsh, Falion.
You've been exploring places you shouldn't, and you know it.
I don't even want to know what it is you've been doing.
It stops at once, or else there will be consequences of an unpleasant nature. Do you understand?
It doesn't happen again, or else I'll have you thrown in jail. Clear?
defeated, regretful
There's a... A problem, yes.
I'm worried about Idgrod, and I don't know what to do.
Yes, but... not so loud!
Will you take it to Captain Aldis?
She's so lost in her visions, and it's only getting worse.
I've looked after her safety for so long...
If she can't tell what's real and what's not, how will she continue to lead Hjaalmarch?
Yes, I suppose there is.
There is a letter, one I have had for some time now. I think it is time it gets delivered.
I cannot leave Idgrod's side, so I must stay here. Could you see that it reaches Captain Aldis in Solitude?
For me? From whom?
Well now, that is something. Hand it over, please.
I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.
But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts.
Now you're speaking my language.
Tell you what. If you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them.
Consider me your new friend in the north.
disappointed, resigned
The last time we'd discussed this issue was before this damnable war broke out. Things were different then.
Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.
What's it say?
These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts.
My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary.
I'm happy to lend a hand as much as I can, as well.
Slightly impatient, not wanting to deal with the player.
I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here.
Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.
Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.
Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down.
Ask her about it if you want an earful.
Very Mrs. Kravitz (from Bewitched). Busybody, nosy neighbor. Paranoid, delusional, and utterly correct.
The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.
Just... try and keep out of our way.
Bolar has been in a bad mood for weeks, now.
Oh? I hadn't noticed.
Since Galka was taken from us. She's been... sad, I guess.
She's just worried about you. We all are. We just want you to be happy. We want to make you happy.
Bolar said you had been looking for a new wife?
Well, I...
I don't think you're quite ready yet.
How will I know when I'm ready?
Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.
Please... How long must I do this? I keep praying, Night Mother. Why won't you answer me?
So... very tired...
Grelod, you old crone. You'll get what you deserve. The Dark Brotherhood will see to that...
Die, Grelod! Die!
Bolar and I will tell you.
How much longer do we have to work this backwoods mine?
A bit longer, yet. We need more money if we want to be chiefs of our own.
But I thought there was only one chief.
Well, right. One of us will be a chief.
What about the other one?
Which other one?
The other chief!
There's only one chief!
I found a big load of ebony at the bottom pocket in the mine.
I can't believe it's come to this.
I really thought you'd be able to save me.
Please, let's hurry.
Let's get to the stables before they find me.
Any news of the Alik'r?
Please, we need to speak in private.
Can you help me find someone? There's gold in it for you.
We're looking for someone. Maybe you can help.
I have some questions for you. I'm trying to find someone.
The Alik'r are not permitted within the city walls.
You're not one of those Alik'r thugs, are you?
By decree of the Jarl, the Alik'r are banned from Whiterun.
Do you have news of our quarry?
Thank you for your trust. I am eager to return to my homeland.
A woman -- a foreigner in these lands. Redguard, like us.
She is likely not using her true name. We will pay for any information regarding her location.
We are not welcome here in Whiterun, so we will be in Rorikstead if you learn anything.
We're looking for information about a woman -- a foreigner in these lands. She's a Redguard, like us.
We believe she may be hiding in Whiterun, but we're checking everywhere to be sure.
Are you sure?
Oh no! They've found me? I need your help!
Please, come with me. I need to speak to you privately.
The who? I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
We're looking for a fugitive who comes from Hammerfell. A Redguard woman. She may be somewhere in this city.
No. There are too many people around. Come with me.
I've told you, we can't talk out in the open. Come with me.
scared, almost desperate but trying to sound brave
You have a death wish, then? If you know that name, you must know to meet him would be to meet your end.
But it seems we both have needs, friend. Perhaps we can help each other out.
You buy my way out of here, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
I have dishonored my brothers by being captured, and so they have left me here.
My life with the Alik'r is over now, but I have no wish to die in this gods-forsaken land. If I can be released from prison, I may start over.
See to that, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
100 gold will secure my release. You can afford that, can't you?
I suppose you'd better hope you can, if you want the information.
Get the money into the hands of one of these guards, and I'll tell you what you want to know.
Kematu is west of Whiterun. It's an unassuming little cave called Swindler's Den.
You realize if you set foot in there, you're never coming back out. They'll kill you.
But that's your problem, not mine.
Then we have nothing more to say to one another.
Because I was clumsy enough to be captured.
Kematu always says we're supposed to be the best of the best. I wasn't.
There will be. Of that, you can be assured.
Of course, sent by... what is it that she's calling herself these days? Shazra? Saadia? One of those, correct?
Did she appeal to your sense of honor? Your greed? A more... base need, perhaps? It doesn't matter.
No doubt she's convinced you that she's the victim. But, do you know why we pursue her?
Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.
I heard a scream and came running, but she was already... like this... when I got here.
Sorry. I thought I saw a fellow running away, but didn't get a good look at him.
Eehhh... no. Sorry. But I did notice that her coinpurse was still intact, so whoever did this wasn't after gold.
I'm going to keep preparing the body, if you'll excuse me.
Mournful, exasperated.
Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
To the east of here is a hidden grove where the Eldergleam resides. It's the oldest living thing in Skyrim. Maybe all of Tamriel.
Our tree here in the city was grown from a cutting of that tree. You can still feel the glory of the mother tree through it.
Even its name is an echo.
Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I said sorry, yes?
Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear it.
I'll already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!
Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what we're all about.
going from angry to purely defiant
I'm not paying any of you a single septim... ever! Now get out of my inn!
With the rumors going around about how poorly your Guild's been doing, she's become much too bold.
I'm not that foolish. The last thing I want is a war with your people.
sudden snap of anger
reluctant to say this
Just please, don't harm anyone. I couldn't bear the thought.
All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical...
In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic.
I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?
Did you mark it?
No, I don't need to mark it. I remember it.
Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Aventus really did it! He got the Dark Brotherhood to kill old Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Hooray!
We love you, Dark Brotherhood! Ha ha ha ha ha!
So where is it?
You can tell it because it has lots of ebony.
Do you ever get a weird feeling about those sisters?
Who has a sister?
Mauhulakh's aunts. You know... the way they're all around him all the time.
That's just how it is with families. When we're chiefs, you'll see how it is.
Can we both be chiefs?
Not today, we can't.
Sometimes I think your head is made of rocks.
That would be good! I could use it to smash other rocks. Easier to mine, then.
Oh, good point. I wish my head were made of rocks.
Come, child, I will tell you how to track a snow cat.
But you said that was impossible.
No, just very difficult. You have to look for shift in various shades of white.
My eyes are sharp.
They are, but your mind has to be sharp, too.
Cough Cough
What's the most dangerous beast you've ever killed?
Oh, probably a troll.
They're fearsome!
They are indeed. Nothing like your mother, though!
That's what everyone keeps saying. But you didn't kill her. That's what I was asking.
Oh of course. My mistake.
What about my father? Was he a good hunter?
It's a wonderful house, my love. If you don't mind, I'm going to start a small store. Something to do whenever you're on the road.
You have quite a house. I'm thinking of setting up a small store here. Sell odds and ends.
Strange house, but strong. Solid. I think I'll open a store. A task to tend to whenever you're away.
This house of yours is wondrous, at least to these eyes. I've thought about starting a store. Something to do here when you're out.
This house is huge. I'll be tripping my feet all over this place. Hey, I think I'll start a little business here. Something to do, you know?
I've seen bigger houses, but it's yours, so I like it. Now, I think I need something to do if you're ever away, so I'll be opening a store.
A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed.
Hello, my love. Back from some adventure I bet.
It's good to see you again, dear.
It's pleasing to see you again.
Ah, it's my love, come to visit.
You and I, we're the only people in Skyrim worth loving. That's what I think.
Good to see you, dear.
Yes, my love? What do you need?
Do you need anything, my love?
Speak. You can ask anything of me, love.
Is there anything you need, dearest?
I love you. You know that, right?
What do you need, love? Ask anything.
Yes, love?
Oh, you've seen your father just trying to chase a skeever from his house. He's a bit soft.
Sometimes I'm surprised he's still the chief.
We all are, my dear, but sometimes the Divines reward those who don't seem to deserve it. Call it dumb luck.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Surprised and loud, then goes into a whisper

I... I'm grateful. It's just this... this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and...
I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and... in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered...
sad, and unbelieving
overcome with anger and grief
Ah, you're back. So, how went your first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager.
Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well.
Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more... personal nature.
Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely...
Very well. I respect your discretion.
If you're looking for a room, you want the Four Shields.
You look like you've seen your share of adventure.
It's no easy thing to make a living in the wilds of Skyrim.
Don't see many travelers out this way.
This land's tough and unforgiving, but beautiful, too.
You hear all this talk about a war? I hope it never comes here.
Seen some mean-spirited folk pass through lately. Thought I was rid of those sorts when I left Markarth.
Welcome, traveler. Mind yourself in our town.
We aren't a big city like Solitude or Markarth, but we like it this way.
If it weren't for Michel, I'd probably be dead in a Markarth gutter by now.
Got a loving wife, a healthy son and a patch of land to call my own. What more could a man ask for?
An eager child
Pa says I'm too young to fight in the war, but I can still help by patrolling the town.
I wish I was a soldier! They get to travel and stay up late and have fun!
Have you met Lucky? He's my pet goat, and he helps me patrol the town.
I'm hoping to run my own inn someday.
Faida's teaching me the innkeeper's trade. She runs the Four Shields.
Please stop looking at me like that.
First the war and now there's talk of dragons. What's next?
Working hard gives a man reason for drinking hard! Well, that and putting up with a wife like mine.
You're a well-traveled sort, I can tell just looking at you.
You been to Markarth? They've got a tavern called the Silver-Blood Inn. Best ale this side of Skyrim.
Money's been tight since the mill burned down. My wife won't let me forget it.
They say a strong drink, a sharp axe and a good woman are all a Nord needs to be happy. Two out of three's not bad.
Rest a spell! Can't work every minute of your life.
Where is that lazy man?
You going to try and sell me something? Well, I ain't interested.
Did my worthless husband send you?
Got nothing to say to strange folk.
Keep walking, stranger.
Got nothing to spare for travelers nor refugees, here.
If you're looking for handouts, look somewhere else.
You want anything in this life, you gotta take it. Just not from me.
Faida's the name. I keep the inn.
Something different about you, I can tell. Hope you ain't here to cause trouble.
The meals I serve ain't what I'd call a Jarl's feast, but they'll fill your belly.
Seen a lot of travelers lately. Mostly soldier, nowadays.
You met the Lylvieves? Quiet family, but they're the heart of Dragon Bridge.
Poor Horgeir. Everyone in town knows about his wife's affair but him. Probably better if he doesn't know.
I think the dragons are here to test us, and make sure we're still true Nords.
I was a barmaid at the Winking Skeever when I met my husband, rest his soul. Wasn't for him, I'd still be working there!
Respect the law, and you'll have no trouble in Dragon Bridge.
Mind you don't cross Tassius. He's in charge around here.
Don't start any trouble and I think we'll get along just fine.
Dropping the tough facade
Another quiet day.
Another quiet day... I hope.
Heard there were wolves on the road up north.
Those rebels better not try coming to Haafingar.
Oh my, a guest!
Please, make yourself at home!
A little creepy
Creepy
A guest, oh my!
Is Hert his sister or his wife? Or both?
Hert keeps giving me this look. I don't know if she wants me or if she wants to eat me.
Just my luck, stuck in the sticks with this crazy old woman.
I grew up hearing songs about Eyldi the Bear! She wrestled a storm out of the sky!
Now that our [QUOTE]ghost[QUOTE] has been unmasked, I hope we see more visitors in town than just the occasional pilgrim.
If I were you, I'd keep away from the barrow on the east side of town... it's haunted.
We don't get many visitors through here, unless their headed up to High Hrothgar of course.
Need a room? Maybe a drink? You name it.
Let me know if I can get you anything.
Anything I can help you with? A drink or a room perhaps?
Pardon me, milord. Would you care to hear me play my lute?
Pardon me, milady. Would you care to hear me play my lute?
If you fancy a bit of music, let me know.
I can't believe Fastred's gone. I... I should have been nicer to her.
If you ever settle down to have children, think twice before you do it.
Any idea how I can get my daughter's head out of the clouds?
You a pilgrim or just passing through?
Watch yourself on High Hrothgar, I hear wolves prowl the steps.
I hope Fastred's doing well in Riften. I miss her.
Pilgrim or not, if I were you, I'd move right through our backwards little town.
You better not be here to stir up any trouble.
And to think that we've been supplying the Greybeards with our own food supplies. What have they ever done for us?
Oh! You're a traveler! You must have so much to tell about the world outside this boring town!
Have anything interesting to tell me?
I can't imagine how exciting it must be like to journey from place to place. You're so lucky!
crazy babbling
You don't look like a pilgrim. Why bother visiting Ivarstead?
Is it absolutely necessary for you to bother me right now?
Thanks again for delivering those supplies to the Greybeards.
Ah, good to see you again! How did that delivery go?
Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.
I wish I could make my deliveries more often, but the road's getting dangerous.
muttering aloud to self
I'm going to put those pelts you gave me to good use.
So, have you shown those furry menaces that I mean business?
This has to be the worst place in Skyrim to run a mill. How am I supposed to do anything with all those bears running around?
These damn bears are driving me crazy!
Can you believe it? Another pile of logs ruined.
I swear, if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to burn my mill to the ground!
Miss Temba is much happier now that you took care of those bears. She may not look like she is, but I can tell.
Those bears are making Miss Temba so angry. I hope you can do something about them.

But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this [QUOTE]insanity[QUOTE] when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice.
Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.
See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that.
Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void.  I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way.
Am I to take your silence as acceptance?
Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away.
Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything.
But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts.
Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting.
Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your... endeavors.
Soon, my dearest. Soon.
I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
Hmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery.
Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.
You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?
Divines smile on you, friend.
I hope the wilds claim you, one of these days.
What do you need, my friend?
I've had just about all I'm willing to take from you. What is it?
You and me, we're the only people around who aren't complete fools.
Now why would I want to talk to you?
Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.
Something you need, you miserable wretch?
Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.
I don't like talking to someone who holds their honor so cheaply.
Good to have you by my side, friend. I need reliable people around.
You have something to say, dog? Something on your mind?
You're someone who can get things done. I like that.
I should bash your face in after all you've done.
You've been a good friend to me. That means something.
What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.
Good to see you again, friend.
You. What do you want?
Now here's a man I'm glad to see.
Now here's a woman I'm glad to see.
You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.
It's so good to see you again.
I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.
Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.
Gods strike you down.
My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.
Just looking at you makes me upset.
Good to see Skyrim still has such fine people. You give an old man hope.
You're just rotten. No good.
I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.
Leave me alone. Can't an old man have some peace?
You're not as dumb as you look.
Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.
Well, look at you. If only everyone acted like you did.
You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.
It's a fine day with you around.
You're nothing but trouble.
Good day, friend! Keeping well?
Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.
Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.
Every time I think of you, I imagine a Saber Cat closing its claws around your face.
You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.
You're the best! Can you be my father?
You're the best! Can you be my mother?
I hope monsters come and eat you.
I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.
The gods know what you've done.
A fine day to you, friend. May you die with a sword in your hands.
What do you want, milk drinker?
May the gods watch over your battles, friend.
Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.
Oh, it's you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant.
So nice to have pleasant company for a change.
There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.
There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.
We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you.
Azura's wisdom to you, friend.
Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.
What do you want? Aren't your hands coated with enough blood?
May your next fight bring you victory, friend.
For your crimes, may Malacath boil your blood and grind your bones.
May your weapons be sharp and your prey fresh.
Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.
These sands are cold, but Khajiit feels warmness from your presence.
Its scent is foul, unclean. Hurtful.
Speak. Khajiit will listen until all the sugars in the world turn sour.
It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?
Ours is to smile at your passing, friend.
It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?
It is our most favored company.

Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?
Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out.
That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!
That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing.
Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!
Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?
The one and only.
Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!
How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!
My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine.
One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!
How much does it cost?
Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.
Grow back that missing limb!
See into other people's thoughts!
Learn a library's worth of knowledge in moments!
Wield powerful magic incantations!

Only twenty septims a bottle!
He has to be lying!
Twenty coins? No one has that much.
Don't listen to him, he's making this up.
Why would you even listen to him?
He gives other merchants a bad name.
This is ridiculous.
I dunno, sounds like I should try it.
What if he's right? Maybe I'll buy one.
I could get rich and stop selling these trinkets.
This is just what I need right now.
I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?
That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will.
Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy.
What a waste of time.
Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.
Brand-Shei = [QUOTE]Brand-Shay[QUOTE]
Now, since we're not the Dark Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him, we're just going to make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days.
You're going to have to sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the strongbox.
You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds.
Not going to weigh in either way?
I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct.
See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?

We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?
Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years.
It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite the lack of imagination on your part.

Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen.
So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous.
Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.
Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!
Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned.
What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.
Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!
Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.
But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?
I wasn't sure that he'd see the light, but I'm sure you [QUOTE]explained[QUOTE] it to him. Well done!
The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.
She's as stubborn as she is beautiful, isn't she? Glad you found a way to get her to pay.
Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine that she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.
Hmph. Yes. Yes, I believe you are. Very well, then.
You need to find and kill Safia, the captain of the pirate ship Red Wave.
The ship travels the northern coast, and sometimes isn't even in Skyrim at all. So you'll have to be patient. Good luck.

Now what did you want? I already paid you.
I know you... everyone's been talking about it. What are you here for?
I'm not paying you or Brynjolf a single coin! Now get out of my tavern!
I said get out! I'm not paying a single coin!
Here for a room or something to drink? Show me some coin first.
You want something or not?
We got the message... now just take your business elsewhere.

Look, I got the message. What else did you want?
It's you! Please, don't hurt me!
Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!
Say last sentence a bit quieter (under breath)
If you're looking for a room, try the Bee and Barb. This place is for the working man.
I'll be here when you're done.
Come back when you grow a backbone.
Just leave me in peace.
I hope Brynjolf chokes on his gold.
I can't stand this city. It's impossible to make a decent living here.
She was the toughest of the bunch. Honestly, I'm amazed she didn't kick you out of the Bee and Barb herself.

Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all.
This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable.
Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared.
Here's your payment.
sarcastic, but happy/funny
semi-sarcastic
Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours... they're murder.
I could do this all day. Here's your payment.
No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done.
And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette.
Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment.
Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and... mirth.
Your payment, as per the usual.
Personally, I've always found Argonians to be incredibly unpredictable opponents. Especially near water.
In any event, nice work. Here's your payment.
Ah! Well done! Well done!
Those caravaners can be an elusive bunch. Takes a fair bit of stalking to take one down. But then, that's half the fun, isn't it?
Here's your payment. Well earned, indeed.
Ah, so the hunter came to know the fear of the hunted, hmm?
Your payment, my friend. Well done.
Don't worry, my friend, I'll spare you the facetious quip about killing a defenseless old woman.
Infiltrating an occupied fort and making it out in one piece is nothing to joke about. Well done.
Your payment for services rendered.
I hope the elf didn't give you too much trouble. I once got set on fire by a sorcerer. Nasty business, that.
But I digress. Here's your payment.
Hmph. Well, that's sure to throw a branch into Falkreath's well-oiled political machine.
Here's your payment. Well earned, as always.
By Sithis, now I am truly impressed!
To kill a pirate captain, on her own ship no less? Simply masterful!
You've not only earned your payment, but my respect as well. And believe me, friend - that does not come easily.
I'm afraid that concludes our business. You have exhausted all available additional contracts.
But I'm sure you've got plenty to keep you busy right about now, hmm?
As a matter of fact, I do. Two of them. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
Your first target is an Orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern.
Happy hunting.
I'm sorry, I don't. Come see me again later.
Well then, your timing couldn't be better.
As it turns out, I've got two new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge.
More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last set of contracts I gave you. Why don't you concentrate on eliminating that final target.
More work? My friend, you still haven't finished the last two contracts I gave you. Let's get those done, hmm?
Well aren't we the eager one? Sorry to disappoint, but there's nothing. Try me again later.
There are indeed. Three, to be exact.
There's Deekus, a shipwreck scavenger. Ma'randru-jo, a traveling caravaner. And Anoriath, a hunter.
Hmph. How about, instead of giving you another contract, I simply deride you for not finishing the one you still have?
So it would appear. Though I'd suspect she'd want you to complete your other contracts first. Do those, then we'll talk about something new.
Just one right now, actually.
I need you to eliminate an old woman named Agnis, a servant in Fort Greymoor.
Well, yes. Two of them. But you're reaching the end of what I have available.
Your targets are a dark elf wizard named Maluril, in the dwarven ruin of Mzinchaleft. And Helvard, the housecarl of Falkreath.
Kill these two, and I'll have one last contract to give you. I'm just finalizing some details now.

anger, about to kill an evil bastard
Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords.
We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared.
Our newest members are housed here in the Hall of Attainment.
I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or... delicate experiments.
Now I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly.
This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others.
Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions.
Initially you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards.
Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know.
anger, executing an evil bastard
dripping with hate, referring to a corpse of an evil bastard
Well would you look at that!
This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes.
I'm not sure. I certainly wasn't expecting this.
thinking to yourself, afraid of what dragons might mean
Close the door.
Come on, close the door.
sarcastically - not a big strong adventurer like you?
Now we can talk.
Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?
Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear.
It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.
That's her business. Not mine. Probably not yours either.
Another new student... I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately.
Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes.
I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?
Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?
Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off.
Well, please let me know when you are.
The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years.
The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings.
It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either.
But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit - the targets aren't going anywhere.
You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you.
Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now.
Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss.
When you've completed all those, we'll see if I might have some more.
You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates.
Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill... that you stole.
A kill you must repay.
Look. Something is happening here. I'm not sure entirely what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out.
If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it.
And I think we'd both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary.
So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads. Hmm?
Best put your other tasks aside. The real challenge is about to begin.
Extra power in the last sentence. Like she's emphasizing the significance of it.
And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life.
Ah, and of course, a bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold... simple and pure. Spend it as you will.
Now then. Time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.
Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit.
Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin.
Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden nearly as much as he should lately.
And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?
You are not worthy.
Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Write of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him.
Oh yes, it is Cicero! You were a fool to spare me. What, did you think I would be grateful? Cicero should be Listener! Not you! Now you will die!
non verbal line - you just look at someone with a blank stare
Ahhh.... gotcha! Oh, Listener, you should see the look on your face! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, Cicero has returned! Not to kill the kind Listener, but to serve, until one of us dies horribly, in service to our Mother! Best friends forever!
In the meantime, I'll make myself at home in the Sanctuary. I'm sure Mother needs... tending.
You! You're responsible for the siege of Solitude! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!
You! You're responsible for the siege of that... city! By Sithis, this undermines all our plans! Fool! Finish that mess, and only then will we speak!
There you go. Take a look around, there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I can find something for these burns.
Let me see if I can get that door open.
Let's keep moving. That thing is still out there.
Second sentence is muffled - like the person's she talking about might be close, and she doesn't want them to hear.
I do indeed.
You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in The Hag's Cure, when the shop is open.
The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament.
Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out.
Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done.
Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are.
You go speak with Muiri. I've got to deal with the Night Mother and her little... clown.
It's all up to you now... Listener.
It's time we put a little kink in the Emperor's security.
Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.
Goodbye, assassin.
You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it.
Go on, now.
Good luck. And try not to get yourself killed.
Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.
Humble Cicero lives to serve.
Angry, thinking and muttering to herself
You may go now...
I am yours, master.
I am yours, mistress.
Walk always in shadow, my Listener.
Just say the word, master.
Just say the word, mistress.
Ready when you need me, Listener.
Cynical, disappointed
Angry, frustrated, exasperated.
Frustrated, annoyed.
Hmph. Suit yourself.
It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?
I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague.
But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King.
I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.
Good. Maybe he's realized he's beaten. The way things are going, we'll be knocking at the gates of Solitude itself before too long.
Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us.
Good. They've had their victories, but Tullius is no fool. The Empire can't afford to keep this up much longer.
I can't agree to any peace council until I know Tullius will be there. The other Jarls could take that as a sign of weakness.
mulling his options
But you're right. Victory is within our grasp. We can afford to give the Empire one more chance to withdraw.
Show up these Imperials for the foreigners they really are.
Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.
The enemy is mustering for a final attack.
Join the forces mustering at the [CAPITAL] (infos conditions on location go here)
Yes, my friend. Though no one has been able to get close to her for as long as I can remember.
As you can see, Eldergleam's roots are large and stretch far, blocking any path to her trunk.
Though, believe it or not, there are rumors of a weapon that even Eldergleam herself would lift her roots for, more out of fear than respect.
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have nothing more to discuss. I encourage you to take your time and enjoy yourself. You look like you could use the rest.
Mama, can we talk. You know, about papa?
Of course, sweetie. What'd you like to know?
I don't know. What'd he look like?
He had your soft face, and that silly grin you get when you've done something wrong. That's his, too.
You are in Eldergleam Sanctuary - just a small glimpse of what beauty Kynareth has to offer. Wonderful place, isn't it?
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?
Welcome to Eldergleam Sanctuary, my friend. If you have any questions, speak to Asta.
Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend. Besides, who would ever want to harm such... Wait, it can't be.
The rumors were true! You carry the one weapon Eldergleam fears - Nettlebane. I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.
The rumors were true... I beg of you, don't harm the tree! Nothing good can come of it.
(Growling)
Not now. The Underforge, tonight.
Not here. The Underforge. Come on.
Thank you for coming, brother.
Thank you for coming, sister.
The blood calls, brother.
The blood calls, sister.
Speak to me, Shield-Brother.
Speak to me, Shield-Sister.
Let's make the bastards pay.
Skjor's somewhere ahead. We need to find him.
Less talk, more hunt.
You've returned.
You don't know what you're dealing with. There will be consequences if you harm that tree. Leave this place - you're not welcome here anymore.
Yes, you were going to demonstrate your ability, were you not?
A standard spell for one skilled in Destruction magic is the Firebolt. Casting one at the seal on the ground here would be sufficient.
Those invested in Restoration magic find Healing Hands to be essential. Can you cast it on me? That would prove your skill.
The Fear spell has saved the life of many an Illusion mage. If you could cast it on the seal here on the ground, that would prove your skill.
The Flame Atronach is a vital companion for anyone relying on Conjuration. Summoning one here would certainly show your skill.
The Mage Light spell is useful to any mage, not just those specializing in Alteration. Can you cast one on the seal on the ground?
It would seem that you have yet to reach a level of skill that the College would find valuable, so I'm afraid I can't allow you to join at this time.
Unfortunately, one needs to be able to cast at least Apprentice level spells in any school of magic before being allowed to join the College.
And thus, you're not skilled enough to be a candidate. I'm afraid we're not interested.
Nords don't care much for magic. The College in Winterhold is about the only place it's not looked down on.
Otherwise you could talk to the Jarl's pet wizard in Solitude.
The College of Winterhold is the only place in Skyrim open-minded enough to teach magic.
Although Ulfric's court wizard has been known to take on apprentices once in a while.
Magic? Goodness, not here! Nothing dangerous like that! That's all kept to that College up in Winterhold.
Better that than dealing with Ulfric's wizard like some do.
Magic is for the weak. Elves, I mean. They keep to that College in Winterhold. They know their place.
Of course there is Farengar. He might be the Jarl's wizard, but at least he's a Nord.
Pfft, I should've guessed as much. Your kind sticks to that College in Winterhold, as well they should.
You'd never think to learn from a Nord like the Jarl's wizard.
There's a College in Winterhold that teaches magic. It's very secretive, though, and you know how people hate secrets.
The Jarl's court wizard was taught there. That one's full of secrets.
Magic? That's dangerous. You want to learn that, go to that College in Winterhold. They teach that stuff there.
Hey! I know. The Jarl's wizard could teach ya. He's lots closer.
I've got no interest in magic users. No use for their kind at all. They're way up north in Winterhold, and that's fine with me.
I don't even like our Jarl havin' a  court wizard.
Bit of advice, folks here don't care for magic or those that use it. If you're intent on it, check at the College up in Winterhold.
Either that or go see the Jarl's court wizard.
smirking at his own joke
Be a lot safer just to have the Jarl's wizard teach you a thing or two.
Magic is nothing but trouble. If you're set on it, there's that College in Winterhold or Ulfric's court wizard. But don't say I didn't warn you.
The people of Skyrim don't like magic much, so about the only place you're likely to find a teacher is the College of Winterhold.
That'd be the College in Winterhold. I suppose you'll be headed there, then. Well, don't let me get in your way.
Seen enough magic in my day to know to stay away from it. I'd stay away from the Jarl's wizard in Dawnstar too.
If you wanna be a damn fool, go to the College in Winterhold instead.
You lookin' for Falion? Why don't you go bother those mages at their College in Winterhold and leave my brother alone?
Any aspiring mage would do well to look for the College in Winterhold. Head there, and you'll get what you're after.
Although our Jarl's humble wizard might be willing to help you too.
Magic? Got no good use for that here. Mages keep to their College in Winterhold. Go bother them.
Wish the Jarl's wizard would up and leave with ya.
Head north to Winterhold. There's a College there, they teach magic. Most Nords don't care for them.
Else you could go see the Jarl's wizard. Might be able to help you.
Magic? You're on the wrong side of Skyrim. You want Winterhold... that College there. They teach it.
Otherwise you can try the Jarl's wizard. I wouldn't, though.
Winterhold. You want the College there. They teach quite a bit.
Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn.
Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it.
Magic is... frowned upon in Skyrim. Only the mages at the College of Winterhold teach it freely. If you wish to learn, join them.
A prospective student, are you? Well, I'm afraid I'm not much good at teaching. You should try your luck at the College of Winterhold.
That's right. College of Winterhold, just north of town. Hard to miss.
No? Very well, it's your choice.
Well done, indeed.
deadpan, sarcastic.
You'll want to speak with Mirabelle Ervine right away. And welcome to the College of Winterhold.
Good to see you again, friend! We've opened the mine back up. If you're here for work, I'll buy any ore you have.
I never thought I'd see Kolskeggr again.
The mine is just how I remember it.
It's good to be mining again.
I've never seen Pavo so happy. It's good to be back in Kolskeggr.
I feel like we're mining even more ore than before.
It's the rush of good fortune, my friend. It makes you work harder.
Are you worried the Forsworn might return?
I doubt the Forsworn would risk holding this mine a second time. They lost many of their warriors.
Do you remember the Legion? Fighting the Thalmor in the Great War?
Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war.
We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.
There were many good battles, friend. I miss those days.
You miss them? I don't know how many times I feared for my life.
Well I can't just tell that to any skeever that washes up.
From the look of you, I'm guessing you're more looking to cause some trouble for the Horkers.
Haldyn will take my hide for this, but Skyrim's been feeling a bit confining lately.
We draw council at Japhet's Folly. The fools in Windhelm won't go near it, which is fine by us.
If you'll pardon me now, my crew needs gathering. Should be in Hammerfell before the other Horkers know who let slip their secret.
Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me!
Here, just like I promised. This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.
humble... halting
That twisted jester will pay for what's he's done...
I'm afraid I don't have a primary contract for you yet.
Why am I not surprised to learn Cicero is alive? I still can't stomach the little clown, but if you've welcomed him here, I won't question it.
Maybe I'll make the Potage le Magnifique, hmm? You may have killed the Gourmet, but true artistry never dies.
referencing the player making a poison batch of soup, think that was funny
I've been expecting you.
Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.
So, what of the old beggar, Narfi? Is it done? Has he groveled for his last septim?
How went your meeting with Ennodius Papius? Did you prove his paranoia legitimate?
I see you're back from Dawnstar. Beitild lies dead, I hope?
You're alive. Then I guess you haven't paid a visit to the vampire yet, hmm?
Please tell me you flayed that horrible bard alive and made a drum from his skin...
Taken care of that layabout Deekus, yet? Or does the idea of killing a fellow Argonian make your scales crawl?
No new boots? Does this mean the Argonian is still alive?
You smell like dead cat. Can I assume Ma'randru-jo has been taken care of?
How went your encounter with  Ma'randru-jo? Back in Hammerfell, I always loved watching two cats rip each other to shreds...
Hmph. No arrows protruding from your skull... Can I assume Anoriath is dead, then?
Ah, back from Fort Graymoor. The old servant has been put out of her misery, I hope?
So, you've returned from Mzinchaleft! A Dwarven ruin... what an exotic place for a kill. Assuming Maluril is actually... dead?
Back from your little vacation in Falkreath. So, did you enjoy the sights, sample the food... kill the housecarl?
You haven't faced that pirate captain yet, have you? Safia? I only ask because you're still alive...
So many contracts, so little time...
Will there ever come a time when the people of Skyrim no longer need our services? I think not.
Still here? What's the matter, can't handle what I'm throwing your way?
I wish I had more contracts to dole out. You handled those jobs like a born killer.
You reek of death, my friend. I salute you.
Remember the passphrase: [QUOTE]Silence, my brother.[QUOTE]
The Sanctuary is in the southern Pine Forest. Close to the road, but away from prying eyes.
Have you talked to Nazir? He's sure to have some additional contracts for you.
I don't have anything for you just yet. Please, talk to Nazir, and see what he has available.
I'm still trying to find a suitable contract for you. Continue to work with Nazir on the, um, supplemental assignments.
The Keeper will be arriving soon, with the body of the Night Mother. So many preparations to be made...
Go, take care of the Muiri contract. There will be plenty more, I promise you.
Why are you still standing there? Hurry, before the meeting begins.
Speak with Nazir and see if he has any contracts available. I need time to read Motierre's letter.
What are you waiting for? My husband is out there somewhere with that lunatic. Find them! Do what you've been tasked to do!
Shouldn't you be out ruining someone's special day?
Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.
Ah, good to see you, sister. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed.
Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!
Let's kill someone.
Citizen?
You must be lost. The tavern is down the road a piece.
I'm fairly certain you wandered into the wrong building, friend...
Yes, Listener?
I am yours to command.
How may I serve you, my Listener?
Yes, Listener? How may I serve you?
Listener. It is an honor to stand before you.
Please...
What is it you want?
Just... just stop. And I'll tell you where I've hidden my treasure.
It's... in a hollowed-out rock. In the tundra. A bit west of Whiterun. Now please... please stop.
Oh gods, you've taken everything I have. Just kill me and be done with it...
Why are you people doing this?
Is it information you want?
This... this is about the inheritance, isn't it? All right! I'll tell you where I've hidden it.
It's in a hollowed-out tree stump. In the marsh, south of Solitude. Now please, you'll let me go now. Right?
Why don't you be a dear and let me go now. All right? I won't say a word to anyone. Our little secret. I promise.
You... you can't do this to me...
Do you have any idea who I am? When my father hears about this, he will gut you.
Ah, now I understand. This is about that my father's hidden cache, isn't it? The dowry for my wedding.
Ha! Well it's safely hidden away, in a hollowed-out tree stump. Just outside Riften, tucked away nice and secure. You'll never find it.
Damn it. I gave it away, didn't I?
I'll tell you anything. Anything! Just please stop... hurting me...
I just...  can't take the pain. Not a second longer.
I'll give you money. Treasure. I have some things hidden away. Take them all. They're yours. Just please... stop.
Just north of Windhelm. There's a hollowed-out rock. I have some things hidden in there. Take them! They're yours.
I've told you everything I can. I don't know what else you could want...
So... wait. Cicero is alive? And we're all friends again? I swear, I can hardly keep up...
You know, I can still sell you some potions and such, or train you in alchemy.
I like it here. We should have moved to Dawnstar ages ago.
Do you need alchemy components? Or training?
Hello, Listener.
realize you're sort of verbalizing internal thoughts, and probably shouldn't be
What do you need, Listener?
Listener, please... if Cicero is going to be a part of this Sanctuary I'll accept that. But can't you do something about the... dancing?
Got to admit, I find the Night Mother's presence... comforting.
The new initiates are working out well. Eager, dedicated, and not afraid to get their hands wet.
Things proceeding well, Listener?
The Dark Brotherhood is on the rise again, Listener. I can feel it.
Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.
Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment...
Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?
You didn't die. A battle you live through is a great honor.
Did you ever want to return to your stronghold? Go back to your family?
Excuse me? What kind of question is that?
I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment.
And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years.
Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere [QUOTE]pranks.[QUOTE]
This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff.
Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through.  But you... you're going places.
Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...
My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.
Wake up!
That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!
Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this.
Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid.
It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it!
I did the Black Sacrament, over and over. With the body, and the... the things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!
Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!
It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.
You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract.
My mother, she... she died. I... I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall.
The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us.
So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind!
Finally! My prayers have been answered!
You've come at last! I knew you would!
Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.
It's Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften.
Well? Is it done?
Grelod the Kind. Is she... you know?
What do you want? You have no business being in here!
Riff-raff! That's all you Riften people are!
This is an orphanage, not an inn. Begone from here.
You don't scare me.
You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!
I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.
The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!
Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him! And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!
What are you staring at, you worthless piece of gutter trash? I simply must start locking the doors again...
Is someone there?
Be careful!
Hey, watch it!
Don't do that.
What are you doing that for?
You could have just asked.
What do you think you're doing?
You're not supposed to be in here.
distraught, seeing a dead friend / a relative
You dirty thief!
Stop, thief!
It can't be helped.
Not my problem.
It would seem so.
It's all in this note.
You've done well.
Maybe you can help me.
Thank you. Here, this is for you.
Just bring it back to me.
I can pay you.
pressured to agree
reluctant acceptance

No need to get rough!

A little coin always greases the wheels.
Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?
For that price? Sure.
You expect me to believe that?
Nah. I don't think so.
That doesn't change anything.
I'll teach you to talk to me that way!
Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!
I don't have to take that from you!
reaction to someone getting instantly killed right next to you
We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!
Gods help us!
What in the...?
I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you.
I would need to challenge the chief, and take his head, to return home. I'd rather stay here.
Don't tell me you, of all people, are afraid of a battle.
If you had to kill your own brother to be allowed back home, you'd think twice as well.
You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?
Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant.
Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant?
You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away.
You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda!
And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.
You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick?
Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back - you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.
Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day!
I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it.
Only bit I could make out was [QUOTE]repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,[QUOTE] and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there.
So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.
It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love.
But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces.
Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring?
That's really a shame - I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.
How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard.
You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook.
Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding.
You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff there that would handle all the guests.
I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.

Head to the Riften jail and talk to Sibbi. Get him to tell you where Frost and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside Riften.
You'll be well paid for your time.
Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering contracts we haven't had the chance to complete just yet.
And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure.
You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum.
I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see.
None can stand against the Wolf Queen!
Well? What is the meaning of this?
even toned, calm, playing innocent
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it that you want?

I'm not sure what just happened but I assure you I will get to the bottom of it.
Whatever it is those Psijics are up to. They cannot be trusted.
For all we know, he's here to scout out the College. I'm sure they want to undermine our efforts.
This! This... Orb. The Eye of Magnus, whatever you want to call it. It's clearly powerful, and no doubt they want it for themselves!
I expect to be informed if they make any future attempts to contact you.
Great Malacath, we beseech you, aid us in our time of need...
Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on.
I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it.
Excited, not wanting to know the details. (Like if a mafia goomba handed you the keys to a Mercedes.)
Discovering as he reads
Business-like.
Try to find out where their fortress is. The captain, Stig Salt-Plank, has to know something.

Just in time. This is Adelaisa, one of my superiors from the Company.
She's been dispatched to... eh... see to it that we get back on schedule.
You should probably speak to her.
I can't express how much easier you've made my job.
Maybe Adelaisa will finally ease up, but I expect she won't.
Ah, yes, your pay. The Company thanks you for your services. Should we ever be able to help you, stop by.
Wistful, mildly angry.
Absent-minded, like he just remembered.

Go on, then. Deliver my message to Sibbi.
I may not be fond of Letrush, but even I've got to admit he's got the upper hand.
Good man. You won't regret it.
Ah, you're a smart woman. That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
That's a real shame. You would've fit the bill nicely.
Give a good [QUOTE]hmph[QUOTE]  before the first sentence
I'm aware of who stole Frost. And why.
SHOCKED, like you just saw somebody punch a baby.
I had no idea you were a woman of violence. What exactly are you intending to do here?
You would violate this marvel of Kynareth's glory to fix that half-breed stump in Whiterun?
Horrified, appalled
Sarcastic, dismissive, then warning. Emphasize *will* in the last sentence.
Just realizing, having an idea. Dismissive until the ellipsis.
Emphasize [QUOTE]could.[QUOTE]
Horrified, disdainful.
Not sure if it will work, but hopeful.
I am a traveler. A pilgrim. I follow the voice of Kynareth wherever it can be heard.
I've dreamed of seeing Eldergleam for years. Might I travel alongside you? I promise not to get in the way.
A hint of [QUOTE]peace be on you.[QUOTE]
You've been here for a while, right? What was it like back when we could still make runs out to the coast?
Well, before that cave-in sealed our ships in here we could loot any size ship we wanted.
Where did you keep all that loot?  I've been here almost a year and haven't seen any of it.
The Captain has it locked away in that drowned ship by his quarters. He says it's [QUOTE]to keep it safe[QUOTE] but I know he's just keeping it for himself.
If only we could get our hands on that treasure. We could get out of here and never look back.
Maybe. For now just lay low and do your job. I have a feeling we'll be rid of the Captain soon...
Frustrated at having a conscience
Gleefully hatching a scheme. Voice fades out at the end.
I knew I could trust you!
Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt.
Don't worry. I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me.
Well... I guess you could say I got on his nerves. I tend to be the voice of reason and he finds that... irksome.
Of course, because of our separation, Vile is now much weaker. I guess he figured it was a small price to pay for not having to listen to me anymore.
Wistfully thinking about the fun he could have.
Clarifying that his offer wasn't nice and friendly, but vicious and delightfully cruel.
Disappointed at the lack of originality
As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas.
Making a dangerous offer
There's an axe. An incredibly powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed.
If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you.
As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side.
Vaguely menacing
Regretful
Death feeds new life.
Hopeful, grateful
One of the quickest ways to make some coin in Skyrim is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.
If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning.
What do you say?
I think we have a nice wealthy home for you to break into. Think you can clear the place of valuables and keep it quiet?
These people just inherited some heirlooms from a relative. Good timing for us, bad timing for them, eh?
Just got a tip on this house... should be stuffed with loot. Care to head over there and find out?
Got a message from one of my people that this place just came into some coin. Should be a good target. Want to take it?
Someone with connections to our Guild wants us to hit this place and send a message by clearing it of valuables. You want to handle it?
Good timing. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail. How about you make them pay for it.
You can give this house a once over. I hear they're fairly well-off and probably have lots of good stuff ripe for the picking. Sound good?
The owner of this place just got an inheritance from a relative lost in the war. Sound like something you can sink your teeth into?
You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.
What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.
It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war.
Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful.
Well, here as in this plane. Mundus. Tamriel. Nearby, relatively speaking.
On the cosmological scale, it's all nearby.
Under deep. Below the dark. The hidden keep. Tower Mzark.
Alftand. The point of puncture, of first entry, of the tapping.
Delve to its limits, and Blackreach lies just beyond.
But not all can enter there. Only Septimus knows the hidden key to loose the lock to jump beneath the deathly rock.
Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected.
This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find  you if he has further need.
The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur.
To harness it is to know. The fundaments. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me.
The Elder Scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening.
This man is completely insane.
It lick the panes and smokes the glass...
emphasize [QUOTE]is[QUOTE] in [QUOTE]a god is knowledge[QUOTE]
I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity.
The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.
I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much.
So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.

We were told you may be coming.
Return when you have completed the Great Hunt.
Greetings, fellow hunter.
May Hircine guide our blades.
We follow you, hunt-master.
The Bloodmoon lights the way.
Show us the path to the prey.
Hircine chose you to lead the Great Hunt. So lead.
A sad time.
I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine.
There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic.
It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it. I tracked it into these woods, but then had my... accident with the child.
I want to beg his forgiveness. Give him back the ring. But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free.
Mind your own business.
We've got nothing to talk about.
Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any trouble?
That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke. Now then...
That's not for you to decide. Soldier.
I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it. Now then...
admitting perhaps he was in the wrong.
But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then...
By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers...

Tempting and ominous, like the biblical serpent
Saying [QUOTE]woof[QUOTE], not actually barking.
Well, well. Hello there, big man.
Hello there, miss.
Barbas, at your service.
Full of vanity and self-aggrandizement.
You have business with Clavicus Vile?
It's nice to be rid of that detestable dog. Things are so much more fun without his incessant preaching.
Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person.
All right, then. We'll get together later.
Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal.
Slowly coming to doubt his own words and changing his mind
Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines.
I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there.
If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you... okay?
Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost... storybook.
Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it...
But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.
Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining.
Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then.
Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend...
And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me.
Slick and corruptively persuasive, tempting the player to kill.
Hrmph. You're no fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere.
And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!
It's a shame, isn't it?
So, have you gotten Nettlebane back from those filthy Hagravens yet?
Do you have the Eldergleam sap?
Welcome, child.
What's happened to the Gildergreen is a travesty.
Please move quickly. Eldergleam awaits us.
Is it much further to the sanctuary?
I can't believe I've finally made it here.
It's like it was in my dreams.
I can almost hear its heart.
Oh. I... well, I honestly didn't expect you to come back. Of course, I'm glad you did!
Now... I don't really want to touch that thing, though. Do you think you could handle the next steps?
Wonderful. I'll use it to repair the tree. Thank you so much for all your help.
Angry, exasperated
Boss was looking for you - said he'd be up at the summit. Better not keep him waiting.
Hey! Somebody get down here! Help!
Anybody there?
I know I heard something.
Hello? Who's there?
You can't hide from me forever.
I know you're here somewhere.

Oh well. Must have run off.

Can't hide from me.
Oh, and when you find Esbern... if you think I'm paranoid... you may have some trouble getting him to trust you.

And when the elves marched into your beloved Cyrodiil, and everyone took up arms against them, wasn't that treason? Against the Dominion? Huh?
Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life.

Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter.
But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize.

It's nothing, I just... It's Nazeem. How did we get to this point, Danica? Is there no love left between us?
Hmm? Oh, well... To be honest, I was just thinking of Nazeem. The gap between us seems to be widening. He is just so... self-absorbed.

If you don't mind me saying so, Ahlam, your husband is a damn fool. Any moment spent thinking about him is a moment wasted.
Ahlam, let's be honest. Your husband is an arrogant, domineering buffoon. These are the words you used to describe him to me... remember?
Oh dearest, who cares? So your husband is a lout. The work you do here, with me, is invaluable. The people of Whiterun know your true worth.
But it's more than that. Nazeem is obsessed with this civil war, as is all of Skyrim. I swear, it will consume us all.
Maybe Nazeem's obsession has merit. This civil war seems so big, so unceasing... I'm afraid, Danica. Afraid for us all.
Ha! Well, when you put it like that, it certainly puts things into perspective. But enough wallowing. And thank you, Danica.
Oh, you are terrible. You do know that, right? Ha ha ha ha ha.
Sir, we really must talk.
Balgruuf, my Jarl. A word, if I may.
I need but a moment of your time, my lord.
Speak.
You've got sixty seconds. Go.
Well... It's your son. Nelkir. The boy has been acting increasingly peculiar. Moreso than normal, I mean. Something really should be done...
We really must discuss the security here in Dragonsreach. Perhaps we could limit patrols in the city, and retain more guards here?
There's been talk again in the streets. A general fear that the giants may move south, and then... Well, you understand.
One of the servants had a wonderful idea. Fireproofing Dragonsreach. In case of attack by, um... air.
My daughter Adrianne wants to forge a new sword for you. Now, it wouldn't be a Skyforge blade, I know, but she really is quite gifted...

Damn it, Proventus. I've got war lurking just outside my gates, and this is what you offer me? This? Begone.
Yes, yes. Take care of it, Proventus. Whatever it is you're talking about...
Proventus, you're my steward. Your job is to offer me counsel. This? This is not counsel.
Hmm... All right, yes, I see your point. Make the necessary arrangements.
Of course, sir.
As you say, my Jarl.
Don't you need my help?
Well, I... If you're sure...
I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you.
Well, I was only trying to help.
Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage.
I was only trying to help you, you know!
I hope the Caller turns you inside out!
trying to be brave
So you do. Thank you, this will help quite a bit.
Good morning, wife.
Hello, husband. You're rising late. You spent too long at the Sleeping Giant last night, didn't you?
Hello, husband. You slept well?
Ah. Uh. Of course I'm not just rising. You must have been out when I woke up.
Like a stone.
Well, I'd better get to work. I have to fix another saw blade for Gerdur's mill.
Take care, husband.
Expecting free information, eh? Help me deal with business first, then we'll see how I can help you.
Besides, you look like your pockets are a little light on coin, am I right?
What is life's greatest illusion?

Are you prepared to make that commitment?
Changed your mind? Decided you want to soldier for the Empire after all?
Well, then. Repeat after me.

Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?
Not now, I'm working.
Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?

Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring.

Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me.
Ha! That's my girl.
Saadia dear?
Oh Saadia...
Yes, mum?
Don't forget to polish those glasses later.
You still need to remove that blood stain. From the... incident.
Just a reminder, sweetie - the blankets still need to be washed.
We're running low on the Black-Briar mead. In a couple days I'll have you make a run, fetch some more.
I'll be needing you to mop the place down extra tonight. Lots of spills!
Of course, mum.
Oh, yes, Miss Hulda.
Certainly, mum.
Oh yes, mum. I'll make sure it gets done.
Well, look at this. Another city rat crawled outside the walls. I don't suppose you've come up here to tell old Froki about your supposed Divines?
you are clearly grumpy.
Start with an approving [QUOTE]Hmph[QUOTE]
They're stolen idols! Imposter gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials.
start with [QUOTE]Bah![QUOTE]
You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne.
You're a grumpy old man, but eager to talk about this.
Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.
Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down.
I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair.
Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever.
So Mikael, what'll it be tonight, hmm? Something upbeat? A Breton jig maybe?
Mikael, son. How about something with a bit o' kick?
Well, I was thinking maybe something mournful. A High Elf dirge, perhaps? These are rather trying times, after all.
You know, Hulda, there's this lovely Argonian ballad I've been studying...
You trying to scare off my customers, son? Lively! Keep it lively!
We've been down this road before, Mikael. Save the sap and sadness for your lady friends. My patrons need life! Cheeriness!
Hmm... Yes, you do raise a good point. What about the [QUOTE]Sweet Maidenfair from Hadleyshire[QUOTE]?
Alright, alright... Um... How about [QUOTE]The Guttersnipe[QUOTE]?
I think [QUOTE]Seven Septims for Sigurd[QUOTE] will do nicely. Especially when they're in their cups.
Well, that's not bad. But I was thinking [QUOTE]Mogo's Mead[QUOTE] really gets the place moving.
Well then, consider it done.
Ah! An excellent suggestion. I'll do that one, then.
Going straight through or did you want to stop somewhere along the way?
Just sit back. This won't take long.
Climb in back and we'll be off.
Sit back and enjoy the ride.
Don't be long. I can't wait around forever.
That's fine.
Where do you want to go?
Ready to go?
I don't do charity. No gold, no ride.
You'd best hurry it up.
I can't wait here forever.
What do you suppose this is all about?
You ready to go yet?
Here we are. Solitude. Safe and sound, as always.
End of the road. Markarth, right on schedule.
Here we are. Whiterun. Everybody out.
This is it. Riften, jewel of Skyrim. End of the road.
We made it. Windhelm. Hope you enjoyed the ride.
No problem.
Hold on. This can get a bit tricky.
We're almost there. Windhelm's just ahead.
That's Solitude just ahead. Only a few more minutes now.
Ah, good. Markarth is just ahead. I'm glad to make it through the Reach one more time.
That's Whiterun up on the hill there. We'll be at the main gate before you know it.
Just a few more minutes and we'll be in Riften.
Fatherly concern
You aren't embarrassed of being racist, but matter-of-fact polite in your apology.
Old Embershard Mine's up there. Used to produce a lot of iron, but collapsed and taken over by criminals, I hear.
Good-natured.  Maybe laughing.
See those stones peeking through the surface? Used to be an old Imperial fort on the lake. Really! Stories say it up and sunk one day, but who knows?
You nod in approval a bit. Those thieves were a pain in your ass.
You only half-believe this, but want to scare the person you're talking to.
You tsk in disapproval. Politicians.
Matter-of-fact racism. You are unashamed of it.
You ever hear the one about the Breton and the bear-tamer?
I wouldn't wander here alone at night. Folk go missing around Chillwind Depths, the cave just over those falls.
There's Treva's Watch. I hear bandits moved in while the steward was off fighting the war. I wonder if he ever got that sorted out?
This place gives you the willies

I don't blame you for being angry about it. I would be, too, in your shoes.
But it was all a mistake. You weren't supposed to be on that cart with those Stormcloak traitors.
And the Imperial Legion needs your help, especially now, with that dragon out there somewhere, and Ulfric back on the loose.
with fear and wonder
But you can bet he'll be trying to figure it out. This could shift the whole balance of the war.
If you want to help stop that dragon, your best bet is to go to Solitude and join up with the Legion.
Stick close. Damn rebels could be anywhere. Don't worry, though. General Tullius will have them on the run soon enough.
Well... maybe not. Dragons haven't been seen in Skyrim for an age or more.
Besides, you have your own score to settle with the Empire now. And with that dragon.
Yes, youngling. Have a seat.

Good morning.
Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...

Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim.
Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War.

Let me see if I can find the right panel...

Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall.
You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.
Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history.

Let's go see if Esbern's right about Alduin's Wall.
After you, Dragonborn.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help.
I hoped to avoid involving them in this, but we have no other choice.
You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in this, but it seems we have no choice.
You did? Maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now.
I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush.
But there isn't any other way through, Legate.
Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way.
Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting.

Hello there, friend. Have you come to enjoy the sights and sounds of this beautiful sanctuary, as I have? Truly remarkable, isn't it?
Amazing that such beauty could exist in a place as desolate as the volcanic tundra.
Praise Kynareth for allowing such beauty in the world.
A truly remarkable place, isn't it?
Kynareth humbles us with her beauty.
Don't come any closer. I don't want Kynareth to think I'm on your side.

I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine.
And skillfully, too. I've been watching you for ages, it seems. You have the makings of a fine hunter.
You may even be my champion. Perhaps.
Your fealty is precious to me. I will make good use of it.
You bear my ring.
I may consider it. But you must first do a service for my glory.
The one who stole it has fled to what he thinks is his sanctuary.
Just as a bear climbs a tree to escape the hunt, but only ends up trapping himself.
Seek out this rogue shifter. Tear the skin from his body, and make it an offering to me.
Fly, my hunter. There are others who vie for my favor. A bit of competition. Don't dally while the prey flees.
There is no retribution in the hunt. It is not vengeance I seek, but the blood course of a living hunt.
There are others who would gladly accept my favor.
They will hunt him while you delay. Your choice.
You've done well, hunter.
And found my favor. That skin will serve you well, child.
Look more closely at it. My glories shall protect you from all this world's grievances.
puzzled, a little whiny
sharply, protective father, you don't want your son to see what happens next
Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one.
With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately.
Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit.
You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor.
Agallon is an efficient man, and will certainly already have begun his tour of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we don't have his schedule.
So, you've got two options. Try to find Agallon yourself, somewhere on his route between the major cities. Or... find and steal his schedule.
You'll find that in his office, in the Legion stronghold of Dragon Bridge. It's your choice. Now go, and may Sithis speed you.
Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to.
You are trying my patience, citizen. Back away. Now.
shocked/surprised/angry
Is that a threat? Back off, or by the Eight I'll cleave that arrogant head from its shoulders.
I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for this. Move along.
You're back. Good. You'll want to hear this.
Lucan at the Riverwood Trader had his store broken into the other night. Oddly enough, barely anything's been stolen.
Nobody trusts those mages, way up north in their college. Gods only know what they do up there.
There have been whispers. A boy, up in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Been trying to contact... the Dark Brotherhood.
Folk been hearing some strange stuff coming from the Aretino place. Chanting. Talk is, little Aventus is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...
A little boy, Aventus Aretino, got sent to the orphanage. Now there's talk he's trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. No good can come of that...
I was walking by the old Aretino Residence, heard the little boy, Aventus? He was chanting. It was the Black Sacrament, I tell ya.
Hear about the little Imperial boy, Aventus Aretino? The stupid whelp is trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood...
Have you heard about Aventus Aretino? He's a little boy, lives in Windhelm. They say he's been trying to get in touch with the Dark Brotherhood...
Been talk of a little boy in Windhelm, name of Aventus Aretino. Get this - he's been trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Foolish lad...
I heard tell of a lad in Windhelm. Aventus Aretino. They say he's been doing the Black Sacrament, trying to contact the Dark Brotherhood. Damn fool.

What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him.
You will? Thank you! Ten pinches of fire salts should give me all I need to bring this forge back to life.
Shutting this place down would dishonor my family's heritage, but what other choice will I have?
Amazing! These must have been very hard to come by.
You've saved my business and warmed an old smith's heart. For that, I thank you.
A flame atronach's body might provide fire salt. They're dangerous creatures that can be summoned by wizards.
Of course, it would be much easier to check with an alchemist. They occasionally have them for sale.
I can't believe you did that. You people are monsters!
You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves.
Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.
Wonderful! Remarkably well-preserved, too.
