Just throw a bunch of random numbers together. That’s an algorithm, right? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why do you want to scan my messages?
It was broken
But we don’t need it and it all goes in the ~~hole in the ground~~ dumpster below
This isn’t a game
*taxes Skarm every time he kills me*
If we’re taxing people now...
I throw things that we don’t need out of the ~~Hole in the wall~~ window
Why do I keep getting taxed?
*throws a truckload of ice at Master*
Said what? <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
That’s just one of my many corpses from the times Skarm ~~and RC~~ have killed me
We have potholes here?

That works surprisingly well

Thanks for the $1 million Skarm
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>

Knowing the bot, it will probably explode

My family cares because a lot of them served in the military
Today was both Memorial Day and my dad’s and grandmother’s birthday
It’s a Persona 5 joke

You guys having a “discussion” on English?

My nose?
*makes Skarm come up with 10 examples*
*brings RC with me*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*throws pulled pork at Flubs instead* this is what I had
No, that was the stuff Skarm gave to me. I’m just waiting to see it explode
*throws deodorant out the window*
*throws bloody shirt at Skarm*
Why do I not have my pancreas?
You recorded yourself giving me deodorant?
Can’t you be helpful Skarm?
*throws Skarm at Flubs*

Ok, cheesecake time

It builds up more on top and it doesn’t get stupidly long
I hate that
My hair gets thick instead of long
Probably someone from ChinaTown
I’d say wrong number
And I just got a voicemail from someone in New York City, speaking Chinese
Just got done having a late lunch with the family for Memorial Day. And it’s also my dad and grandmother’s birthday

The only thing I miss about high school was seeing the handful of people that I liked
I have been enjoying not being in college. But I was working a lot and it did take away my motivation to do anything
I’m glad I didn’t have to take any finals <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I also think Skarm doesn’t want to kill me for real because he gets too much enjoyment out of this
But I always respawn
Wrong target
*throws Skarm at shaco*
*takes a drill and drills that into Gummy’s brain*
Ok, Autocorrect: why do you want “talk” to be “y’all”?
*inserts Star Wars dark side talk here*
*makes Skarm do something loud*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
A butt with a hat?
~~You never know~~
*makes Skarm rip Dragonite’s hair out because he thinks it’s fun*
Gummy, don’t rip you hair out. Unless you want to be bald <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, I had a really weird dream. I was at some place that was a mix between a game store and a clothing store where I met a YouTuber I watch, but SpongeBob was there at some point. And then it ended with me at a warehouse for some reason
Ok, I’m tired. Off to sleep...
But, today’s episode was pretty good
Ok. MLP is a little different from the shows I mentioned because I no longer have the channel it airs on, so I have to look online for a website that has it or use someone’s reaction just to watch the episode. Which can make me not want to bother watching them
I haven’t really been keeping up with many shows anymore. I’ve been trying to stick with DuckTales, Steven Universe, and MLP to some extent, but my interest in animation has been going down over the past few months
I never actually watched that show. Does it still have fans?
Hi Dragonite 👋
~~Greetings and Salutations, Demon Lord! Welcome to the Kingdom of Zeal!~~
Lol
NO 😨
*noms peanut butter*
Blame Disney, got it
Or I can just blame Skarm and move on
Something mental or psychological or something
Why must I feel really tired when not in bed but when I get in bed, I feel wide awake?
You’re really into watching animals suffer 🤔
*throws RC out the window*
It’s 7:32 and I already feel like going to bed. Help
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
It’s 84 degrees and I have to go to work. Send help

And what did she say?

So...
Everyone here
Yeah, like that one guy
Nothing...
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
Jokes on you, I’m not wearing pants
I guess it’s “Take RC’s Door” day instead of that

That would suck but be hilarious and ironic
Hooray to technology being shit sometimes!

Why must I still feel tired after sleeping?
From The Waterboy
“Ben Franklin is THE DEVIL”
Fallout: New Vegas, Gummy
I never played New Vegas; only 3 and 4
I still think Fallout 3 is a bad game. I had very little enjoyment playing it
What’s Pride and Predjudice?
Bad graphics (even for the time), bland color palette, uninteresting world to explore thanks to that and a lot of repetitive locations, stiff gameplay, an uninteresting story, and making it so you can’t explore after the ending
I still don’t like Fallout 3.
*gives Gummy a CD with Persona songs on it instead*
They both have flaws, but I think 3 has more flaws
I don’t know how people can say Fallout 3 is better than 4
😐
*throws copies of Fallout 4 at Rainy*
It’s better than 3; I really didn’t like Fallout 3
I like Fallout 4
For a second, I read “Yosuke” as “Yusuke” and I thought “WAIT, YOU COULD GIVE BEST P5 CHARACTER A PIGGYBACK RIDE?!” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That would’ve been hilarious
That scene in the anime was great
This is pointless
*throws Fortnite out the window*
YouTube: stop recommending me Fortnite videos. I never cared about it
*gives Bella some batteries*
*moves pizza places closer to me*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I guess he didn’t like the rock
*gives the broken rock to Skarm*
Break time
*breaks a rock*
God dammit YouTube...
I really hate when you enjoy a subject but the teacher sucks
It usually feels like medicine barely helps me in general
I have to work all day today with my cold and it doesn’t feel like medicine is helping
~~Yeah, that’s my job~~
😒
Go back to bed Skarm
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Just woke up
Morgana? Is he telling you to go to sleep?
*breaks a chest with shit in it* I did it just fine
It’s a broken radio
This plastic club is actually 10 times better than any club I’ve seen
Thanks RC, I could use another golf club
Yes
I will say, to enjoy golf, you need to be either really good, really bad, or really drunk
I like golf
I haven’t bothered with codes because I have lost interest in Gen 7
That’s all I remember
I remember the Cubs winning the World Series
I read that last word as “salt” 😛

One kid was called on in class and started explaining it and I said out loud, “WHAT?”
When we were learning that in high school, I was completely lost
The answer is 0

Hey, Dragonite suggested it
*throws Gummy to Master’s grandma*
Now what do we do?
Why else would he call him? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*shrug*
I never answer 900 numbers because of shit like that
One 900 number I looked up that called me was apparently a scam number
I get a lot of random numbers
Someone called me earlier. I didn’t answer, but he left a voicemail saying he wants his money back and then bye
My parents were arguing so I went up to close the door and my dad got mad at me for closing the door
I hope their paid online service will help them in the long run
Nintendo has a really shitty time with their internet connections
Yes
And I want to play Splatoon 2 on the tv, but I keep getting disconnected halfway through matches
Because this stand is in the way, I guess?
I don’t know why, but it stays connected better when I’m in my bedroom upstairs than here on the same floor as the router+modem
And I can’t just move the dock because there’s a lot of stuff here I’d have to move
Ok, I really hate how spotty the WiFi is for the Switch. I don’t know why, but where the dock is, sometimes it has a hard time staying connected. Like, I could move the system a couple feet in any other direction and it would be fine
So, what did you do to Skarm?
😏
And there were a couple kids who made puns every day. They were the best
But, I really enjoyed it
Most people didn’t like most of the videos because we were all bad at making videos with no budget <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It was nothing news related
We made videos and they were apart of a “Newscast” that they air through the school
But still, I only really enjoyed one class; Video Production
The smart kids took Physics. The dumb kids took the classes they failed. And I took whatever the fuck I wanted
We were only required to take English senior year; that’s the only class that everyone was required to take
*throws computer out the window*
Luckily, senior year, you weren’t required to take a science. So, I didn’t 😃
I got a B in Bio in 10th grade
So, if I go to another college, that credit probably won’t transfer
My worst class in college was General Bio with a D. I thought it would be easy with “General” in the title. But it was awful
I got a C+ in the Bio Class
Oh, one guy in my Intro to Human Bio class got a 14% on one test
I’m pretty sure mine did that. I remember getting curious about that a while ago. So I tried logging in to my old school email and it didn’t work
*rolls out*
I once got a 100% on my 7th grade math midterm.
“Snowing” his phone? There’s snow on it? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

I’d give the pirated version to someone I dislike
No, it’s a legit copy

I never saw any Spider Man movie. Just small parts of them
I just want to see Deadpool 2

I just don’t care about action movies. Except maybe Deadpool
AC/DC
PC

This is why I put explosives in my belongings

Oh, I haven’t seen it. Don’t really have interest in it
Which movie was that from?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jaIo82uT0qs
*blasts Rivers In The Desert instead*
*makes Gummy listen to Persona 5 music instead*
*throws pop music out the window*
Usually pop
I also don’t get why Drake is pretty much the most popular “musician” right now in all genres
Modern rock, I have trouble listening to a lot of it. Because most of it has too much pop in it
Because that’s popular too
I prefer rock music and country. Actual country, not pop music with slight acoustics somewhere
Like hip hop music for example. It’s so popular right now and I don’t understand most of its appeal
I usually have a minority opinion on a lot of things
I hate how the majority of people are idiots
I really don’t like people
irl, I’m pretty quiet and antisocial until I get to know you
*sends Gummy to a therapist*

~~I’m glad I stopped dealing with school in December~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Just imagine this music playing during the final: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nxS8YDjTpeg
I remember every time I picked it up, I got 5 minutes into it and stopped playing
While looking, I found this old GBC game
*switches places with Skarm*
It wouldn’t surprise me if someone threw it out
Except once
I could never get mine to work right
I don’t know where I left the Pokewalker though... 
it’s my 2nd favorite Pokémon game
I actually got my copy on Day 1
Well, now I want to talk about it
Irrelevant
I’m used to Skarm being violent
How is Skarm choking me good?
*it’s not very effective...*
*throws Skarm out the window for reminding me of that*
At least you can eat it without vomiting, unlike me
And Skarm is being weird again
*gives Bella a truckload of bacon*
Just get a couple chicken patties or something, some bacon, and cheese
Well, you could make one yourself
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
That is, if you eat beef and pork
No, everyone needs Baconators too
It was because of my nose being all stuffed up and my head was hurting
Couldn’t get to sleep until 1 and I woke up every couple of hours
Ok, last night was fucking terrible
*throws toilets out the window*
No
Good idea *cuts off nose and throws it out the window*
But getting to sleep is the hard part
But I won’t be able to function
Well, I hope I can sleep well with a stuffy nose later
Dogs are great except when they bark and you want scilence
*screams*
And he doesn’t like it?
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Yeah, he’s probably busy with Skyrim or something
Get Flubs some allergy meds, Skarm
I see being unable to breathe allows you to level up. Hooray for pain
And my allergies got really bad
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
🎉
Well, I think I got a cold or sinus infection or something. Yesterday, I couldn’t stop coughing and today, my nose won’t stop running
There’s Baconators
I never went to prom either
He doesn’t bury me. I come back from death too quickly
So now there’s 4 of me in the Nommer’s club?
So, the bot thinks RC is Chewy now...
But there’s only one of me
I think Skarm could teach the class on how to kill me
Earth to birdbrain, respond now
No, Flubs can’t do that birdbrain
Kangaroos in science class would be awesome
I’d rather have Skarm teach science over Gummy
I didn’t even finish my 7th grade sewing assignment
Home Ec was required in grades 6-8 where I went. I hated the sewing portion
Cooking and sewing
You can sacrifice the trash I throw out
And this app is a pain to use
I’m golf coach now
Ok, I downloaded the app that I will only use this one time and then delete it tomorrow
*throws my sanity out the window*
Really? I need to download an app to edit on mobile? 😑
Can I be the golf coach too? I’m the only one here who golfs, probably
You need working legs
Ok, why is Flubs the cheerleader?
I’m back and I’m confused. Good job
Good
*puts Gummy in detention*
Yes
Ok, I’m going to watch YouTube. I expect to be very confused at what’s going on when I get back
Where’s Bonnie?
Brad
I have another source of income
It’s good to rhyme
All the time
What’s JavaDoc?
You actually threw me into my home that looks like a trashcan
*throws RC out the window* I needed to clean right where you are

I don’t know why Master said I was in detention
How about I be the teacher who hates his job?

Gummy will be the kid always in detention
There was one point in 10th grade where a couple kids came in and played ukuleles in class

Again, Skarm went to school?
If I can’t eat it, no one can

Stick figures ftw
I still draw like a 1st grader
I was never good at art
*throws Gummy out the window*
I want to take that math class
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
One thing that was weird: in my grade in high school, there were more kids in AP Calculus than regular Calculus. Usually it’s the opposite
I took Calculus in high school for credits; then Statistics in College
Also, one class had (including me) 8 people and the other only 3
One was fine, the other was boring
I took 2 summer classes
You doing summer classes Kugal?
I’m glad I’m done with it
And my college has buyback on some books, but not all. If it’s not hardcover, nope
College materials cost too much fucking money
Remember when you mentioned TSwift every other day here?
I don’t know, why DO YOU have a lot of that?

<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
What country do you live in for that to be legal?
Meme day at school sounds like it should be illegal
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
I really hate open world games like that. Just very boring...
Who was the creator of this game?
The characters can range from nice and likable to idiots and assholes
Here’s some criticism of real life: people suck
And I’m just playing Mario Odyssey
7/10
LOL
No
And Skarm still isn’t saying my name
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
They’re being put to use
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Now I want to see Taco Bell using muskets to put taco sauce on tacos
*throws exploding muskets at the tacos*
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
A simple musket can’t break the walls of this bunker
*in the bunker*
*goes to the bunker*
*throws bacon at Dragonite*
*noms out of the ground beef*
*throws an army of Baconators at the tacos*
~~Tacos are too overrated to be in a national anthem~~
Thanks a lot Skarm...
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Why does everyone here shove stuff down my throat?
So get a washcloth and clean them
Btw, does anyone know of an actual store that only sells soup?
*takes all of Gummy’s soup*
“The Monarchy of Ninnies” call it this
If you want me to, I can <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What Master?
Give us some soup Gummy
I said the phrase a couple times so it automatically suggests that when I start typing it
Autocorrect
It’s a filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti
Who screwed up Skarm?
@squid
Thanks for the pop tart Majestic
Why would I repeat preceeding statements a lot? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why would hating the bot be a reason to backtrack
I know, right? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~But doesn’t Skarm already get into our conversations?~~
Ootage? What’s that?
Yeah, you didn’t get the joke Dragonite
*throws burning Flubs out the window* You don’t need to burn the whole Kingdom down
*sets fire to Flubs’s mind*
😐
I had microwave Mac and cheese myself 2 hours ago
*throws books in the fire pit* I needed a fire starter
*noms soup*
*throws Skarm at Flubs so he can be not bored*
*throws Skarm at the soup store*
I agree with that statement on the Mystery Dungeon games
*hits Discord with a fish* Did that help? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
No
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I feel like the Twitch app on my phone isn’t good. After a little while,  streams just keep lagging, no matter who I watch.
~~That means you really need Jesus RC~~
I heard yanny
At the college I went to, you could register for classes yourself online
Can you apply to classes online?
<:doit:334014889137930240>
I heard about the golf ball size hail
Right now, I’m just playing Mario Odyssey again. Haven’t done so in a while
It rained for a little bit earlier
Gee, thanks 😛
Yes. It just looks weird
So, will the d at the end of my name go back to his old placement?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
There is bacon flavored soda. It wouldn’t surprise me if Gatorade made a bacon flavor
Gee, thanks...
Ok, can I get the “d” in my name back?
STAY OUT OF THIS MEE
Flub
😐
Who is this Squi? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~You suck~~
~~Because lines through words are better than regular words~~
Here’s a congratulatory Baconator 🍔
Yes, you being creeped out IS a dumb excuse
Well fuck you too birdbrain
😐
And Skarm is still not calling me General Squid. It’s <:Treason:396483914803445761>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Well, I just recorded another video. Now, I really need to get back to working on the script for one video that I haven’t worked on for a while now
<@303048546179874816> You’re so MLG <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I think I’m starting to feel drunk. What alcohol was in those?
*noms bricks*
*runs*
~~But I don’t have a reddit account~~
Bored ninnies eh?
And I’m not going to eat anything because I already had a snack
1) Why does the bot have brony friends?
2) Why would they nom Dragonite?
I guess you aren’t hungry
*makes Skarm nom Dragonite for nomming my umbrella*
*uses umbrella*
It’s not raining here
~~Is there a subreddit for subreddit?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws a bomb at the Window of Zeal*
*throws reddit out the window*
*makes Gummy not skilled*
*makes Master chat here until he passes Gummy*
~~Or did you?~~
Why were they exclusive to GameStop? That’s ridiculous
I forget; were copies rare back in the day?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~You should’ve tried to get Chugga to give you one of his 50 copies~~
How many times have you shoved exploding fish down my throat, trying to blow me up Skarm?
Yes you have
And now, I will head to my bunker before the fans or Skarm try to blow me up
I just haven’t had interest in playing it
I still haven’t picked up Xenoblade Chronicles in a couple months
That reminds me
*rolls away*
*says nothing*
*rolls in*
*confiscates Majestic’s something*
And suddenly it goes from cloudy to pouring in 5 seconds
It’s gotten a little dark out
And a quick strong storm is about to come through
~~Or you could just be yourself~~
French fries are always welcome
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
“Accidentally”
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>

I’m back from work ya Ninnies
<:LUL:305559915714576385>

It’s “General Squid” Get it right birdbrain
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I remember in 7th grade, 2 marking periods, I had bad English grades because of that
Yeah, that’s it. I really fucking hated having to do that
AR? I think I remember that; I hated it, if I’m thinking of the right thing
~~But I thought you were somebody~~
*throws two of those darling out with the gutter that Flubs thrives in*
~~We are really predictable at this point~~
*throws gutter out the window*
I just had food and I’m still hungry
lol
I feel like anything that catches on anywhere becomes stale
Ok, so you blew up a rock
*switches places with Skarm*
*rolls in*
（。_°☆＼(- – )
I see Skarm threw explosive sushi at me earlier
Today’s the 3 year anniversary of Discord
*switches places with Flubs*
I said, Skarm got full
Good, Skarm got full
I think Animal Man has really good luck. Maybe he should try to win the lottery
（。_°☆＼(- – )
It was only 20%?
Why did this happen...
No, don’t do that
He asked you a question Skarm
It wouldn’t surprise me if it was 90-100%
*throws bluej out the window*
~~Up~~
If everyone is weird, then no one is weird. So, is everyone normal? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I’m pretty sure that’s blatantly obvious RC <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
That’s just weird
~~You Don’t have to nom to eat~~
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*noms underline*
I hope I’m not hurting anyone down below with how much I throw out the Window of Zeal
*throws it out the window*
I don’t like this terminology
But Skarm was already broken
And the process of throwing everything at Animal Man was repeated
*also Skarm was there*
*throws everything at Animal Man*
While Animal Man is playing “EVERYTHING” the game
~~oh, I thought he was playing Skyrim~~
（。_°☆＼(- – )
~~Three~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What did I walk into...
*honors the dishonored*
*shoves exploding context down Flubs’s throat*
*throws content out the window.*
*again*
~~Don’t ask~~
I kind of knew it would be pinned
But afterwards, I don’t want to see another person
And ok coworkers
My social interaction is with idiot customers at work
And I don’t have enough interest in Terraria to stay long before getting bored
Is Flubs being happy that Eyan’s not streaming <:Treason:396483914803445761> ?
He’s not
Hey, seeing exploding shit get shoved down my throat should make everyone stop being upset
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
*throws Skarm at Rainy to make her not upset*
*throws Skarm at my job*
Anyone want to go into work for me?
*noms downvotes*
~~Simple. I just didn’t play Stardew ever~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws any thought of getting an explanation out the window*
😐
What’s libgdx?
And now Skarm has another way to kill me. Yay...
Why?
You need to have ice cream at the wedding then
Ok, we need to complete Season 7. Then Skarm can marry Master, his true love 😏
~~Is Master marrying Skarm?~~ <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
A lot going on this weekend 😛
Happy birthday! Today is actually my parent’s anniversary and my niece’s birthday 😛
🎉
And he likes it? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Looks like I’m in a repeated cycle of throwing Kenobi at Skarm
*throws Kenobi at Skarm*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
No, it feels like 80%
~~And I just don’t like Gen 5~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Stuff doesn’t last long enough to leave an impact
That seems to be a problem with adapting most long games into anime
As for the games, I like 5 more, mainly because there were several times 4 used anime cliches that just annoy me
My problem is that so far, it feels kind of rushed and it doesn’t have the hilarious comedy that the Persona 4 anime had
I was referring to the actual anime
So far, I would recommend you do that over watching the anime
I’m currently re-watching a Let’s Play of the game again
When I think of the final persona, I’m reminded of when they say something about a demon lord
Yeah, I think that’s important
If the Uber was an ambulance <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh
What part are you referring to?
I was just about to say that 😛
*throws Skarm down south*
*throws Gummy up north*
Did I break Master or something?
~~Everything and nothing~~
*throws Kugal at Flubs*
~~I think you need to give Flubs another math lesson~~
Or just do what Skarm did
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
*gives Flubs Skarm for something to do*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Don’t ask how I got it
*gives Flubs a nuke*
*gives Flubs a flamethrower*
I’m not your cake, pie
I don’t think he liked that
*throws Skarm into TVtropes*
I showed the people in Stephen’s Discord and one of them thought I was trolling them <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That was awesome <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*looks up Skyrim mods for throwing your kitchen*
Then it’s an unwrapped Byte <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Well, I have to go in and cover for someone at work. I hate doing that...
mmmH
~~We need to change that~~

And where there is bourgeoisie, there is people
Perfect
*throws Skarm at the Republic*
“So today I’m going to be talking about blah blah blah”
~~For me it is~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And when they expect you to be in front of people

I never actually watched that movie the whole way through
Chicken Run is regular?

Why is Trubbish relevant to this?
Mmhmm
*rolls away before the possible explosion*
*lands on the giant mattress filled with stuff that won’t explode*
He said that to himself but he was too nervous to do it himself. So I thought that I should help him
He wanted out
*throws the .0001% out the window*
“YOU WILL GIVE ME AN EGG”
~~What if Skarm is really Dragonite?~~
*throws Skarm at Java to make things interesting for Dragonite*
Lol
The stupid thing is in the meme channel
It involves the hiker dance
Well, I'm getting ready to make something stupid...
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I’m not waiting 8 hours
What is it now birdbrain?
I see Skarm is making no sense as usual
*throws Kenobi at Skarm*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*slaps Mobile Discord with a fish*
~~Take Skarm to therapy with you~~
Don’t go adult
Or for when you aren’t near a computer
Ok, it looks like he’s not fighting
*throws Skarm at the inner thoughts*
I thought we had only a small amount of Red people left
*throws Skarm out the window for lying*
Can Skarm just stop blowing up my house?
NOT THAT
*makes Skarm do something anyways*
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Why not just sleep for 8 hours?
*throws the odds out the window*
Just take your beating with dignity Skarm. And stop taking my door
*switches places with Skarm*
~~I still think Mexican food is overrated~~

Back from work and I feel really fucking tired

It’s a disappointing thing
It better be a good thing
THERE’S THE LAMP

It’s good at being something you can throw
*throws rock out the window*
*pokes Skarm because reasons*
*sigh* I’ve felt like shit all morning
I’m not going to make it to the stream tonight either
We should be getting through the worst in a few minutes
It’s really fucking windy
Currently riding up to my sisters, but we have to ride through a bit of a storm
I don’t have a banjo
*throws Skarm at the weather*
It’s 6:15 and it’s still pretty humid out; I still don’t like humidity

Did you know avocado cappuccinos are a thing?
WAIT. I REMEMBER SOMETHING
I don’t have to work tomorrow so I’m fine
They are bad
What the hell does avocados have to do with anything?
It was a joke
No
I don’t care about java
So we have 2 conversations going: one about coding stuff and one about breakfast food; only in the Kingdom of Ninnies Who Do Stuff
Still needs salt and pepper
Bleh
Last time I had hashbrowns was at a diner that undercooked them and they had no seasoning
It’s night; closer to a midnight snack than brunch
Those hash browns aren’t golden and crispy enough

Crackers are food
I gave you a cracker <@239928598696427520>

Well, I’m all caught up. Now to do nothing until I go to sleep
And I have a dentist appointment right after work, so I won’t be able to relax for quite a while
AAAAAAHHH
Well, I need to catch up on YouTube fast; I have to go to work at 8am tomorrow, which means I need to go to sleep early, which means less time for relaxing
I already know that
Uhh... say something Skarm
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Is that a shanty from Assassin’s Creed?
So, it’s pretty windy here

**We’ll give you more updates as this tragic story unfolds. Tragically, we’re sure**
Pretty much
*rolls around*
I really don’t feel like going to work later
I was just joking. And it’s not fair Skarm
But I have tech problems and Linux questions <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Eh, baseball is boring~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I haven’t played Odyssey in at least a month
I’m not really doing anything
No, it had a potato on screen
*throws a computer at Skarm*
I’d help make more puns, but they probably won’t be punny enough
Do you need help making more puns birdbrain?
I don’t think he wants to do that, at least according to that message
Or if the tea just kills you
Someone who dislikes tea?
Hope you like that cup of tea <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Good, I didn’t get hurt
Or is it?
Too bad
*throws Skarm into the mix*
*random dragon gibberish*
Fus Ro Dah?
Things?
What the hell is going on?
*noms numbers*
*throws Flubs past Flubs so Flubs can get past Flubs*
⚰
“There’s no reason to quote me” Skarm
Who is Skarm referring to?
It’s just me throwing stuff at Skarm, as usual
Don’t ask
*throws Kenobi at Skarm*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
~~Or you could just get a reasonable amount of sleep~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Bob Ross videos are welcome at any hour of the day
I lied. I have to catch up on some YouTube videos and then sleep <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh, Eyan’s streaming. I’ll come when I get home from work
<@239928598696427520> Because Skarm killed you <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Because you couldn’t get your shit to work, you had to take your anger out on Flubs by killing him...
Why did you have to do that Skarm?
*uses Max Revive on Flubs*
😐
*throws Skarm at my job so I don’t have to go in today*
<@239928598696427520> Sure
<@239928598696427520> Ok
<@!162952008712716288> Whatever
*throws red paint at Flubs*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*pokes Master for no reason*
Lol
No, you try to kill me on a regular basis birdbrain. And RC just loves assaulting me
*throws RC’s coffin* that’s too small. Looks like it’s meant for Skarm
I’ll build your coffin <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
1-42-3-56
*noms oxygen*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~Don’t you have air all around you?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Actually, 3:51
<:doit:334014889137930240>
Don’t hit the dog with a door
*switches places with Flubs*
*throws a fish at Skarm*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
What are you going to do about it birdbrain?
*leaves the remains of the time rock inside*
No
I’ll just blame it on Skarm then
That was a time rock?
*breaks a rock*
Break time
*throws Skarm at enhasa*
Yes, but that’s irrelevant
Wait, isn’t that the fish I use to slap things with? Give me my fish back birdbrain
*throws Skarm at something*
~~Yeah, just ignore what I said~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Work fucking sucked tonight
Well, we know that now <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Telling us what?
I think he’s allergic
*tries shoving the salad down Skarm’s throat again because he wants it*
Maybe Skarm wants to stay healthy
Why not? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Who gave the bot the banhammer?
😐
*shoves salad down Skarm’s throat*
No, don’t nom the technology. You’re supposed to nom this salad, you ninny
*shows Skarm what a salad is*
**More Chickens**
^
They were poisoned
*explodes something*
~~Is that treason?~~
🤔
I’m bored. Say something interesting Skarm
<:Senate:395030198636249089>
*throws a fish at whatever that stuff is*
How is that a joke Skarm?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*rolls in*
Well, I finally have time to work on a video. Took me long enough...
Ok, I think my bad luck from Overwatch is spilling into Splatoon. I just lost 4 matches in a row and in the past 10, I only won 2
~~Isn’t that when you get the banhammer?~~ <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
~~You Get the No Life trophy at level 50~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*explodes again*
Anyways, I’m really going to sleep now
Yep
People have a bad impression on him. He’s actually a cool guy
No, I talked to him a few days ago. We already caught up on current events <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
With how much people try to kill me, I think I’m either already a ghost or I’m immortal
Watch 
*explodes right as I close my eyes*
Yes I do
Ok, I need to sleep now
Yes, this is how things work
We give those to Skarm <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Explosive it is then <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Regular or explosive?~~
There we go
*makes Dragonite say something daft*
Whenever we get Eyan to do a smirk face
*throws an explosive fish at Flubs*
Dammit
*noms video*
*pays those assassins to not do whatever Skarm told them*
1) Skarm has friends?
2) What jobs could he give them?
Why must I get shot?
😐
*throws something at whatever that stuff is*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
The main problem I have is that, occasionally, it will freeze when I try to import something
I use Premiere and as I said, I found a way to get the 2015 version for free <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’ve recently been working 5 days a week. I really have little time to do much of anything
I haven’t had time to make videos recently
I used WMM for 2 videos before this; I hated it
Then I used YouTube’s video editor for a while. I didn’t use actual editing software until August 2017. Even then, I got it for free <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
For a year and a half to 2 years, I didn’t even edit my videos
It used to
~~BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUTUBE’S VIDEO EDITOR?!~~
Night Dan
Tastes like chicken
*shoves Skyrim in RC’s face*
I also downvotes it
I already said that
Play Skyrim Dragonite
WHAAAAT?! HE KILLS YOU?! I DIDNT KNOW THAT!!
Wait, I forgot. Does he kill you? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
DAMMIT SKARM. NOW I HAVE TO TAKE FINALS AGAIN
*throws Skarm at Flubs*
No
Because dabbing is dabbing
7.8/10. Doesn’t say “Dabbing Luigi”
There
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I see Skarm didn’t want to notice me
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*rolls in* I’m home *falls asleep*
*pokes Dragonite again to be sure*
Yes
*pokes Dragonite*
Wrong target
*throws Skarm at Animal Man*
~~YOU’RE TOO LATE~~
Good luck Kugal
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I see Flubs still hasn’t Flubsed the place down yet. I’m disappointed
#MoreChickensInSkyrim
Especially considering in March, how him and Dan had to get all of April’s content ready. Plus the sponsored video got them even further behind
Being behind
Yeah; he has said it really does bother him
That just shows how far behind he is, thanks to the trip 😛
Btw, last year, he was able to finish December and release Fan Favorites by April 1st.
At least until he finishes December and the Fan Favorites
He does have some plans for the vlogs, but I think he still wants that to be secret for now
I am a Patron of his
I do prefer the vlogs; by himself, he’s not the best Let’s Player. His best content usually involves him and his wife, or with all his friends
He’s a Let’s Player and vlogger
Stephen Georg; a YouTuber
I saw Stephen tweet how many GameCube games he got on his recent trip and I had to show it
*throws Skarm at Dragonite*
*throw the joke out the window*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*noms Ukraine*
Which had explosives in it; the cane
That’s Flubs’s cane
And I remembered again that I turn 20 in 2 months. I feel old every time I remember that...
But I don’t want to be 9 again. I don’t like school 😛
I moved to my current house in 2007
I have nieces and a nephew younger than it
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
While Diamond and Pearl have some big flaws, I still love Gen 4, mainly thanks to Platinum
I prefer Platinum, but I do have fond memories of Diamond, since it’s the first Pokémon game I completed. My first game was Gold, but I didn’t finish it; too young and not very smart
It includes Chugga and NCS
I’m reminded of this
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7oYPMQvSDZ4
That REALLY surprised me
The most memorable shiny I got was in Platinum. I got a shiny Chimchar as my starter 😛
Also, I’m back from work
The last shiny I got was in Omega Ruby a couple years ago. It was a Linoone
Aaaand I got to work this morning. Yay...
It took me a long time to get to sleep, which made me feel really tired...
I don’t think we can question Skarm’s actions
*throws Kenobi at Skarm* <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Or RC
That’s always you
So, I guess it’s just me and Skarm here
Shut up Skarm, you ninny
I’m back from work ya Ninnies.
😏
Anyways, I’m off to work
I just found out it exists
Oh, the “Bot-Explosion Proof” package
Well, looks like I got to rebuild my house for the 50th time...
Why did my house have to get blown up in the process?
Good job Flubs
The bot has his own server?
Looks like Skarm really wants Gummy to go in for me
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Ok, so Gummy will be going in for me, I guess 🤔
*makes Skarm go into work for me*
I’m a cashier at a local store
Ok, it’s time for my usual “Anyone want to go to work instead of me?” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, I ended up sleeping for over an hour. I rarely ever do that
A
J
🤔
😛
😏
*sigh*
Stop making things worse Skarm
Great, now we went through that all over again...
*chucks Skarm at Animal Man*
Hey, I didn’t directly hit you
*throws wutface at Animal Man*
😑
😏 or 🤔
kik
*throws Monopoly money at Dragonite and a toy car at Animal Man*
Ja
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~Get a tattoo of a Baconator~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I was on the phone so long, my dad said, “You’re still on the phone? What the hell?”
Great, my friend calling me made me miss the beginning of the stream 😑
I had to look up who he is. I do recognize a couple of his songs
Thanks, I wanted to go for a swim
*unmutes Skarm for Draco*

Dammit, I hit Skarm again
*throws butter at Jello*
😏
For what?
~~Now I want fried butter. Again~~
Butter on jello? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Anyways, I always keep reading Jello’s name as “Head Butter Jello” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I honestly don’t mind Claptrap
“I’ll have you know I stubbed my toe last week, after watering my spice garden. And I only cried for 20 minutes”
That was a quote
“Back in the good old days, we would’ve drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!”
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*shrug* The instructions said not to
Actually, you can’t put the cup in the microwave. You have to boil water and pour it in
Lol
I was just joking 😛
Gladio’s character: I LOVE CUP NOODLES
And then the mission ends with everyone talking about how great Cup Noodles are
“We must kill this giant creature only to put it in Cup Noodles”
I will say this: the funniest mission is probably The Perfect Cup. Just because of how blatant the product placement is 😛
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Eating these made me realize: I haven’t had ramen in years
One of my favorite FFXV quotes: ARE CARS SUPPOSED TO DO THIs?!
Or make it a monster truck
More product placement 🎉
No, these are just ok. I’m probably not going to get them again
Also, I’m eating Cup Noodles now. Only because they were in FFXV <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I know 😛
~~That it’s April 20th and you live in Colorado?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Moral of the story: everyone is terrible
“Most people are either Squid, assholes, or both”
Oh, it’s Opposite Day? Then I guess I should be nice to Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms spaghetti*
So you stole my spaghetti
WHO STOLE MY SPAGHETTI? I WANTED TO EAT THAT
Wait, where is my spaghetti?
No, they’re chains. The spaghetti is over there
Now you can’t escape
*chains Flubs to the floor of Zeal*
Am I right Skarm?
Probably a majority of them
😐
*throws Skarm into toilet land*
From work
I am also back
About to go home, it’s still snowing. 😑
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Anyways, I have to go to work in a couple minutes. And it’s still snowing. And I need to scrape snow off my car. Yay...
*throws Animal Man in detention for not going to school* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*confiscates <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065> from Skarm just because*
*throws training montage at Skarm*
4 losses and 1 win: I think I’m just bad at multiplayer games
It feels like, half the time in Splatoon, everyone on my team gets killed all at once, multiple times in one match
Two people? Hey, I think at least 4 people will see it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh joy, we got even more snow...
Don’t burn the place down while I’m gone. I want to see it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ok, since I didn’t get much sleep last night, I’m feeling really tired, so it’s time to sleep now
You should do what I used to do and procrastinate <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Perfect use of time
I’m glad I don’t have any exams to take <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
But I didn’t throw enough at you
*throws not enough numbers at Kugal*
TOO MANY NUMBERS
Oh no, math...
It was only 2 feet deep
*throws Skarm out the window on the 581st floor*
Oh, that’s why I was falling for so long
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Should we ask Eyan for his reasoning on putting us so high?~~
Why did we put the Kingdom of Zeal on the 45th floor anyways?
I hit the ground
Well, shi- **SLAM**
*patches holes with things*
*grows wings*
😏
He does in that many days in the month
Flubs or Skarm put explosives in them
Oh, that was me throwing a box of Boston Creme doughnuts out the window <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🎉
*kick Skarm there anyways*
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
Don’t ask
*throws Skarm back in time to the Ottoman Empire*
But when I don’t get sleep, I feel weaker
Wait, how did you know I had a sister?
You assumed my sister was there?
I switched my place with Skarm before I blew them up
*destroys cliffs with a nuke*
WHY DO I KEEP GETTING THROWN OFF CLIFFS??
😐
*throws Skarm off both cliffs*
Why was their 2 cliffs right by each other?
*throws reasons off a cliff*
Why did I have to get thrown off a cliff?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Why not why not?
Why not?
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
Because why not?
I guess not
~~Do you have an answer Skarm?~~
24
*hides fish nuke*
There was a fish in the snowball <@178655272796028928> ? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*dodges and watches it hit Skarm*
I’m sick and tired of snow
So, I’m getting more snow tomorrow 😑
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Lol
🚪
Are you bored, Bored? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hi bored
I’m getting hungry but I don’t really feel like eating
Now that he’s gone...
Bye
So, Skarm is purposefully trying to be like Dadbot? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Don’t you mean Skarm?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’M GENERAL SQUID. GET IT RIGHT
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*throws the word HELP at Flubs*
Go help Flubs, Skarm
*throws Wolverale to algetty*
He’s good
For me, Black 2 still has problems from the originals that I have (Sprites and overworld still look rough and I’m still not a fan of a lot of the characters) but they are still much better
So, how much better is the sequel over the 1st to you?
I never had that much trouble with her
I really wish I could go back to sleep. It always feels like, after I wake up, I can’t sleep unless I just can’t keep moving
*throws Skarm at Flubs*
Yeah. I’m going to try and sleep again
I had some toast because I was starving and I felt fine when I woke up, but it didn’t stay down. I still feel a little nauseous and really fucking exhausted because I only got 5-6 hours of sleep.
Well, I had to call in sick today...
I’m going to stop talking now.
No
I do have a weakness to certain greases that some food is fried in. Like the stuff Wendy’s used to use
😑
Ok, I really have a weak stomach to whatever my place of work cooks their food in. I just got sick again...
Ok, I think I need to stop eating at my job; their food keeps making me not feel good
Lol
And I don’t know why, but my phone battery was going down really fast today. It was at 3% when I got home. It never gets down that low
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*goes back to work*
😐
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Flubs*
Ok, go sleep then
You go work sleep
I still have to work until 7:15
And all of a sudden, I feel tired...
Well, that backfired on me
😐
*throws thinking at Skarm*
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
Am I Eyan now? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428> At least according to the bot
Hey Skarm, go do my job for me
Anyways, for 2 hours of my shift, I will have to work with 2 new people. 😑
Ok, Meteorologist
Thunder snow
*throws snow at Flubs*
We don’t need any more snow
*breaks winter*
*breaks something*
Break time
No
Work is never fun
I’m going to work now
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Why would Cadance rant about this?
*throws Skarm at mee6*
OK!
Will throwing Skarm at it help? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws red paint at Animal Man* You’re red now
😏
*throws Skarm at Majestic*
~~YOU LOSE! GOOD DAY SIR!~~
~~You failed~~
And Skarm shoots my arm while saying Draco is bold
*doesn’t poke Skarm because reasons*
*pokes Draco*
😑
Day 3 of 5 days of working in a row
😐
WHY NOT?!
Go to the bathroom Flubs
And it’s a button RC
It wasn’t pee, Flubs
*throws something at the coin*
*sigh*
😐
*throws Skarm at the Thalmor*
Night

I DONT KNOW WHAT WE’RE YELLING ABOUT
HOW DOES A GUY WHOSE LEGS DONT WORK RIGHT WIN?
I think so?
*throws Skarm at the bad Discord connection*
Ok, I can actually connect to Discord now
*throws pink paint at whoever wants to join*
**PINK BROTHERHOOD**
The meatball incident
That happened months ago
😐
Wait, who are you talking to Master?
I do sometimes blow small chunks of whatever out my nose, since the nasal things and esophagus are connected but not half a meatball
This will be the last I talk of this for now: Also, this is very gross. One time, I had spaghetti and meatballs. But half an hour later, I threw it back up. Afterwards, I blew half a meatball out of my nose. It was weird
But story:
I never like vomiting. It always hurts
I think we’re talking about this because I mentioned not feeling well
There was one time where I vomited and then half an hour later, I felt all better. I never feel like that.
I never had that
I just have a weak stomach and I hate it
You can narrow down the suspects
I did vomit once last week, but that was because of what I ate when I got home didn’t sit well with lunch
I don’t know why, but all of a sudden, the food I usually eat at work is making me not feel good
<@305267880935555072> You are a **CASUAL** one
I’ll take that as a no <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And also puns
We envision you saying I’m a bold one and then killing me Skarm
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Ok, I’m getting bored. And I still have 10 minutes on my break
That won’t help you birdbrain
*blames it on Skarm*
😐
*breaks something, but I’m not sure what*
Break time
*gets Skarm to go into work for me*
But... who will be sworn to carry your burdens now?
*throws Lydia at Flubs*
Make my shoulder feel better and I can help you <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
And the back of my shoulder is hurting. With how much I have to work this week, I won’t have much time to rest or try something to make it feel better
*rolls down*
*rolls around*

Well, that accomplished nothing
*throws explosive shoe at a rock*
*throws Skarm at complex spreadsheet*
*throws a fish at the numbers*
That’s a bunch of blah blah blah blah blah
But how can Skarm and Dragonite both nom one Dragonite?
*uses full heal on Master to cure confusion*
*gives Flubs Skarm to help him*
💀
*noms shoe*

Are you saying we should make toast out of Skarm’s circuits? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Wrong target
*gives Master a flamethrower*
My job really fucking sucks...
You have to fight for your Twitter account <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I know how that feels
Can’t we just love dogs and cats equally?
Cats are welcome then
Doggos are always welcome
I’m also in Stephen Georg’s Patreon only server and a fan server for another Let’s Player
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
And before anyone else does it...
One I barely talk in though
I’m in 3 others
Honestly, if this REALLY gets to you THAT badly, you really should take a break
And that’s the priority here?
Well, screw you too
You calling me an idiot? 😑
*threatens Game Freak with Skarm*
When there’s no new information
I will admit, I think we’re at the point where there’s not much new to talk about
Here’s my badge
RC, you don’t have to sit through every debate that goes on here
OBJECTION
RC’s head goes to the block <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Honestly, I don’t mind it as much as you, RC
I usually have something to say
*shrug*
Usually Wolverale starts the Pokémon talk
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*rolls Flubs*
We are even more capable
But I’m part Baconator
Hey, I’m not the worst role model here
“Don’t turn into a Squid”
😐
*revives music*
My soul is a soul
Oh, Breaking Benjamin is kind of bland
Is that an eye staring into my soul?
No
Because RC wants to be like Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Yeah, Skarm does that a lot
I upvoted it
*throws Skarm at the pink*
Oh. I don’t do League 😛
Hmm?
So, 15 of us need to make second accounts? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Someone make a 2nd account~~
I was about to say that 😛
So, a reasonable person would blow Dan up, according to Skarm? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I don’t think Skarm is ever too lazy to be a prick
You only had 6 plates?
I’ll take that as a yes
Is that you Skarm?
*throws the Dragonite ringing bell at a rock*
*throws pie at Draco*
Flubs, you can have this bad apple pie
But does a tough battle make a good character?
He’s a character from Pokemon, Flubs
I didn’t like how his motives are just “I will rule the world”. He also makes the ending feel like a bit of a cop out
Ghetsis is not good
I really suck at this
Uhh... go do laundry and fall down the stairs
Don’t worry: I’ll make a joke about your legs
Yep, this apple pie isn’t good
I got pie now. And it kind of sucks
I’m not Majestic you ninny
No, I’m saying Skarm has to pay for a new door that won’t explode or hurt me or destroy my house
Stop hitting me with my door. What if you break it?
*throws anime at Skarm*
Well RC, it looks like he disagrees with you
What does? Me not getting sleep or you helping me?
Hey Skarm, help me sleep more
Sometimes, I only get 7 because I have a hard time falling asleep yet I wake up at the same time
I always try to get around 8 hours
The only way I’m up at midnight is if I’m tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep
I can’t sleep for 12 hours. The longest I can sleep anymore is 9 hours
I don’t want to sleep now. I’ll be awake at 3am
I feel tired like I always do
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m sure they still have plenty of fans who don’t care about the drama at all
I do still enjoy some of the Nostalgia Critic reviews (even if some people say they never liked him) but I can’t continue watching him

Probably
I don’t know if this is because of Michaud or if Doug and Rob don’t care or something else
It’s kind of pathetic, how they are too stuck up to apologize to anything
So, Channel Awesome is down to 2 creators left; other than Nostalgia Critic
ohONEoh
^
It was so bizzare
I had to take it off because it felt like I was eating a sloppy joe
Random thought: Ok, so for lunch, I had a chicken Parmesan sandwich at one restaurant. Normally, it has tomato sauce on it, but for some reason, they put some sort of meat sauce on it
My luck is always bad <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws coffee creamer at nothing*
~~I think Master is addicted~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You played Skyrim for 7 hours straight? 😐
*rolls to bed*
Ok, that’s great
And with that, I’m going to bed. Any last words?
Puns
Wow, Skarm really likes underlining  Animal Man today
~~The sky is up~~
__Flubs__
*underlines Flubs*
So, Skarm threw the Lillie bot into the black hole and then underlined Animal Man
*puts Skarm in Flubs’s place then*
*throws Flubs at the zero*
Negative infinity
Where exactly were we going with this?
-7
-2
2
5
7
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*makes Skarm get me more Max Revives*
Those suck
You just deleted my regular revives
Or deleted
I died for the xth time. Good thing I have plenty of Max Revives that can’t be destroyed or taken away from me
I can tell
Nothing can sto- 💣
*rolls around all the mines*
Boredom. Yay
*rolls around for no reason*
Bombs
Yes
~~We can change that~~
~~Watches Flubs come in at the mention of bombs~~
I can’t hit anyone with them and they all hit me
Green shells always annoy me
I get angry when the green shell I throw hits me
Was there 8 of them? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*also throws a crazy 8*
*throws an 8 at RC*
😑
Random thought: I feel like sleeping and it’s only 8
If I did, I wouldn’t have bought Deluxe
I never bought the DLC on the Wii U
Ah
When did 200cc first get put in Mario Kart?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
It usually involves everyone running into every wall
200cc is still hard to get used to
I’ve noticed you always pop in when Skarm says something, RC. <:KappaPride:379352530863521792> ?
*gives Skarm To Flubs for no reason*
On the downside, my dad and mom are both downstairs; my dad getting irritated about something. So I don’t feel like playing a game down there
I just love days where I don’t have to do anything
How’s past life detention?
Well, dinner time
*sends Skarm back in time to do that*
Ok, I’m glad we got that sorted out
What exactly did he lose in the first place? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Emphasis on again
Have Skarm make bread <@!137336478291329024>  <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
E) Make Skarm do something
C
Wrong target you ninny
*throws Skarm at the sun*
Tomorrow, back to the 40s and 50s
Also, it is now in the 70s; really warm and I’m not sure if I like the sudden temperature spike only for today
Lore can be either really interesting or really boring
Lol
Aww, I missed the Level 50 quote <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
So, did anyone have some bad luck today? 😈
I just realized: today is Friday the 13th
Grilled cheese?
Phones make great food for birds
*throws sleep at gnomes*
Hopefully, no one calls in sick 😑
Well, I don’t have to work until Sunday, so I’m glad that’s happening
*throws <:Treason:396483914803445761> at Master*
I was busy with a Pokémon debate in another server for a while 😛
Nintendo Switch Master Race <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:PCMR:305892755014418435>
Actually, I now have an urge to throw Baconators at everything. Thanks Dragonite
I feel the same
😏
Get back here
*throws Skarm at phone*
I’m back from work. And Discord was offline a few minutes ago for me
*sees new pin* <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Join who?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*throws nothing at Skarm because I’m bored*
``yawn``
*breaks nothing*
Break time
*throws Skarm’s regards back at Skarm*
Oh well. Time to go to work
I don’t have that key on my phone 😑
How do you do that?
__Wolverale12__
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
This meme is just a picture of deodorant
*takes the meme from Skarm*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250> ?
🎉
Come on, level up now
It’s almost time for me to level up
*noms standings*
I don’t have a birb fish
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
It’s a fish. Not a birb
*throws a fish at Skarm because he nommed me*
Second...
First, no. The Baconator place is closed
*noms nothing*
Now, I have nothing
Hey, I was going to eat that Squid
No, I ate what I had
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*rolls to my job*
Well, that didn’t work
*pokes Skarm so he’ll do my job*
I really don’t feel like going to work today. I’m tired. Go do my job Skarm
I wish I had a potion of cure disease...
*sigh* I hate getting sick...
I’ll just blame Skarm
Who kept giving Mother Nature all the cold alcohol?
Can the snow just go away until December?
It snowed a little this morning. But it all melted
~~I totally don’t need to learn new conversation starters~~
So... how about that weather?!
It’s the broken one that hit Skarm
*chucks a phone at RC*
But I didn’t want to get hit by a phone
But I didn’t do anything...
*dodges and watches the phone hit Skarm*
Nice “English” Dragonite <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Nope
I still think about how long I have left every shift
It feels like, the more I work, the faster it feels like the days go by. I don’t think I like it
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Huh. I joined Twitter 3 years ago today
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
*disowns Skarm for being boring*
That’s not interesting
Say something to make this day a little interesting Skarm
Yep
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I’m sure when I get back, it’ll be really busy. That’s how it usually goes
Well, this was ~~boring~~ great. Back to work...
*breaks nothing*
Break time
I can’t function in an 8 hour shift with no sleep
Sleep is for SquidofBaconator people too
*gets Flubs to Flubs the place down*
I don’t think Knock Down is even a move
Ok, time to sleep
No Gummy
Why?
Wait, really?
But I didn’t throw the book...
Why is it so important for me to get hit with a dictionary?
😑
*dodges dictionary and it hits Skarm*
*gives RC a French-English dictionary*
I don’t like dark chocolate
Is that dark chocolate?
So, how about that weather?!
Again
This guy gets it
^
First cashier to not leave themselves and just get fired
I had to work 6 days in a row because someone got fired
I don’t have to work Friday and Saturday (hoping no one calls in sick) so I’m looking forward to that, since I just worked 6 days in a row
Probably Dragonite
1) I already have deodorant 
2) Why drag Ida into this?
*throws Skarm at big words*
What’s the English definition? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And I’m too lazy to check.
What’s stoichiometry about?
I have an 8 hour shift tomorrow. I also need help
This guy gets it
^
Gee, I wonder what... <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
🎉
*sells the wine glasses for 6 gold*
The wine glasses, right?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*makes RC have fun with helium because Skarm wants it*
Puns are not insightful information. And we’ve heard that several times already. Get some new puns
It’s “kinda” an order, so he doesn’t have to do it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
He’s not listening to you
Too bad
*also gives Gummy Skarm for company*
*takes away Gummy’s ability to invade countries and gives him Skyrim*
Stop invading countries and play Skyrim
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Yes
*cough* Skyrim *cough*
Say something interesting Skarm
*rolls around* I ran out of things to do, but I don’t want to sleep yet
Who said I stole it?
yes
*noms all the maple syrup*
Maybe they have all our fried food? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
No, the hockey rinks got destroyed <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It was only in the 30s today. By Friday, it will be in the 70s
No it’s not. Where are you birdbrain?
*slaps Skarm with a fish because of this*
😑
*throws Skarm at Master for asking*
You don’t want to know how I get all the trademarks approved ™
And someone is trying to kill me again. Just a normal day in the Kingdom of Many Names ™
Also, relevant pic in <#311402910820859914>
*throws the dark sides at Master*
Bingo is also on the Switch
I’m glad I have this image saved 😛
The more you know, eh? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Yes
Wow, there’s a word search game coming to the Switch <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
On the bright side, the temperature should get to the 70’s Friday
More <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I do like building those large LEGO things. But, they cost a lot of money
Well, I ran out of things to do
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Wrong target
*throws Skarm at the school board*
*throws a fish at the school board*
But why do they feel the need to be this ~~insane~~ strict?
That’s ridiculous; why are they so strict?
*throws Welcome Skarm at Majestic*
Majestic, hello
*noms cake*
Using muskets in WW3 feels like we’d be going backwards in technology
So Skarm will show respect to me soon ™
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*switches places with Pokémon White*
Oh. Go right ahead then. Burn it  <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Burn what?
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*rolls in* Done with work for today
*throws trigger away*
*throws Skarm at my job so I don’t have to go in today*
*throws nothing at nothing for no reason*
Yep. It’s hilarious
Well, now to watch the new Stephen&Friends GTA Online. I’m sure it’s hilarious
I don’t know. Ask Skarm
*throws this Squid (not me) at Skarm*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*throws Skarm at his hotkeys*
Weeee?
*throws something at this*

I probably don’t want to know what’s going on 😛

I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Quiet you
*takes shoe and throws it back at Skarm*
*makes Skarm go to work for me*

Good, I can actually connect to Discord now
*throws physics at physics class*
*also throws Skarm out the window because why not?*
*throws puns out the window*

Still snowing in April...
Don't sigh, you deserve it
*slaps Skarm with a fish for beating me when I didn't do anything*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*the Reach belongs to the Forsworn*
Ask Master
The bot thought you were yelling 😛
See?
Brad, don’t yell at Skarm. He doesn’t like it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I doubt you can get Skarm to understand much <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Sure you can
*level 10 fish thrown at level 1 spell*
~~I’m still not a pc expert~~

Throw it at you? <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
And RC is back to hurting me more than Skarm. Is RC slowly becoming the new Skarm?
Well, my plan didn’t work...
*explodes Skarm for Master*
*throws RC’s door at RC*
I think most of the Channel Awesome stuff deals with Mike Machaud being a bad businessman

Lol

So, Mee6 thinks I’m an it?
Also, Skarm referred to me as “it” 😐
So, Skarm likes being broken 😏
Wait, I broke Skarm again <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*breaks something*
Break time
You’re going to do a leg sweep on me with my door?
Give my door back Skarm
He certainly likes hitting me with my door these days
*throws Skarm at bad wifi*
Well, looks like I’m not playing Mario Kart. *goes to FFXV*
Ok, I hate how my Switch sometimes won’t connect to the internet unless I put it right next to the router for a few seconds
With how Squidward is looking, it looks like my name freaked him out 😛
Oh. I was just too lazy to change it <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I just found it on Google Images <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Ok, back to work. *throws chicken at Skarm*
Dammit Skarm, can’t you do what I want you to do?
*throws Skarm at car*
Also, I really hate how I feel even more tired than I was going on break
Arrest him then <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hey Skarm; say something interesting. I’m bored
I hate having to get here at 8 in the morning

We know everyone here is beyond help <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why can’t he leave? He wants to go home

Nons? What’s that? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws a golf club at Dragonite*
Golf
I don’t like either sport; boring
Ok, so the Splatfest in Splatoon 2 is between Baseball and Soccer (Football in other countries) which should I pick?
*throws something at someone*
Throwing them into rehab
One comes in every Sunday morning and waits until 8am to buy beer
There’s a couple different alcoholics who come to where I work
Fuck that
One time, I was waiting in my car to go into work (I was a little early) and one homeless guy came up to me and asked for a dollar. I know that he comes in only to buy beer, so I said no
I prefer Krokorok

No you didn’t ninnybot
I’ll stop murdering Skarm when he stops trying to kill me
*kills Skarm before he can kill me*
😐
~~Robbie Rotten is best anime character~~
😏
He really did shut up <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh, shut up birdbrain
This is just half of it. ProtonJon would be pleased 😛
One funny thing going on in Stephen’s Discord is that, Stephen made an emote of the gold egg in his April Fools video and at least a dozen people have used it in a row, including me 😛
*throws Skarm out the window*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Oh?
*rolls around*
*throws an egg at RC because he wanted it* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m a SquidofBaconator
I just had some good apple pie
*throws something at Gummy for not getting April Fools Day*
*throws Skarm at the laziness*
Hello Robbie Rotten
~~Sure, Easter is fine, but WHAT ABOUT APRIL FOOLS DAY?!!~~
*throws Skarm off the ship*
Wrong answer
Or another pun
I guess Skarm is loading his reaction
Did I hit Skarm again? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws another battery to Master*
Good thing I’m not on my bed
*throws something at Skarm*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
More April Fools videos:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGH4DoYHQWQ
How does he disappoint you?
In 30 years; I think I’ll get to 70 Million subscribers then
I know <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Happy April Fools Day https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DqzDGezS8Hg
Ok, for some reason when I pause a video in YouTube and then go here, the video plays again. Mobile Discord is dumb
Good
I don’t want you Skarm
Now I got a free arrow and shoe. Thanks
Wrong target
*throws Skarm at Flubs*
😐
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I really don’t feel like going to work tonight. *throws Skarm at my job*
I haven’t seen that movie in years
*throws a robot at a kid* That didn’t help
In the future, can we put a volume button on kids? They’re so fucking loud half the time...
I doing know I’m what don’t!
Well, I’ve had better ham
😐
*throws a party*
Buy some lederhosen then; that’s German, right? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Don’t get fabulous and divine clothes, just get regular ones
Do we need to throw Skarm at the cool down time too?
*throws Skarm at the 🎉*
I just remembered: I have to work a closing shift tonight: I’m sad now
😏
You’re looking at a girl. By anime logic, if you so much as glance at a girl, you’re a pervert
I never had gelato
*throws Skarm at German WiFi*
*throws Super Mario Sunshine at Florence*
😏
*throws Gummy in German jail*
Thanks Flubs, I could use that knife
The closest I will ever come to actually visiting Italy is eating at the Olive Garden
*uses Flamethrower on Dragonite’s fingers* Does this help?
Yeah to Olive Garden? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Does Italy also have Olive Garden? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I have only left America once and that was to see Niagara Falls when I was 1
12:58pm
I just realized I had ham yesterday at Cracker Barrel. Oh well
*throws Five Guys and Wendy’s fries at Bella*
I love cooked ham
We’re having Easter dinner today since my sister and nephew are here today
Flubs, it’s either McDonald’s or that country’s food
~~You have to only eat German food while in Germany~~
If only we didn’t need sleep to function
My mom just referred to the Pro Controller as a remote 😑
Eh, I’m fine with no Terraria <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*gives Skarm some random hand*
😏
Then we need to get rid of Skarm’s wings.
*throws Skarm and 1,000 tranquilizer darts at Master*
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Master*
Today felt like a Saturday for me
I’m just not doing anything right now other that this
League still doesn’t interest me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
1 for all?
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
My favorite soda is A&W root beer
I never had Mellow Yellow
Sprite is the best for me
I get those 2 mixed up
OH
What am I thinking of?
Random thought: if you have the option to get Sprite or Mist Twist, get Sprite. It’s better
If you don’t want a kitchen, get Flubs to cook
*looks at Dragonite* Are we having baked dragon tonight? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*rolls around*
*dies because it appears that’s what Master wants*
😐
So the fish doesn’t explode in my throat
*switches places with Flubs*
*throws Skarm at the not historically accurate town*
WiFi in a medieval town? Not very historically accurate <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That does absolutely nothing birdbrain
*throws Skarm at the nothing*
No, you stole that nothing from me
_steals nothing _
You better get us some of that free dessert <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’ve been watching someone Let’s Play that game. I don’t plan on buying it
*throws nothing at nothing because of boredom and laziness*
*throws spiders out the window*
RC wants you to kill me, not make puns you filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti
#dabonthemhaters
My video is scheduled for 7am, I think. “The Greatest Video Ever”
It incorporates Easter into it. If you want, I can show it or not if you don’t want to be spoiled
So, Stephen showed the thumbnail for his April Fools video and it’s great 😛
Is he explaining his own quotes?
Oh, I get it now
~~Of course you like it~~
Shut up
I like puns. But Skarm is still 😑
To what?
<@239928598696427520> I hope you like getting poked by Skarm <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
Getting angry at me is something you learned from adventures? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Don’t get angry at me birdbrain
*throws Skarm at my job*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
And with that, I go back to work
*throws details at Skarm so he’ll stop holding Benny*
Flubs, Skarm has your dog
Put the dog down
*gives it back to Skarm*
~~So, does anyone want the rest of this garlic bread?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hey, giving me exploding garlic bread is rude
No
*also breaks Skarm for giving me exploding garlic bread*
*breaks nothing*
Break time
Ok, I’m really leaving now
Why didn’t you give Animal Man some exploding garlic bread, Skarm?
Welp, time to go to wo- 💣
I haven’t exploded yet
No, I think it’s regular.
*noms garlic bread* Thanks
*gives Gummy Skarm to help him feel not homesick*
*sigh* Another day of working...
I wish I was sponsored by Wendy’s...
I guess so. It’s just me eating a Baconator and putting music behind it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And now, the April Fools video is scheduled # *dabonthemhaters*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’ve been having a bit of trouble staying asleep for 8 hours straight recently
*noms time zones*
Look who’s talking
*throws Skarm back to last December*
Past
That’s how it works, right? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Gummy back to Thursday*
~~Dragonite?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws protection away*
👀
*throws Skarm at math*
Well, I don’t know what to do now. Any ideas Skarm?
*throws a fish at Skarm*
Shut up ninnybot
I’m back from work and I feel really fucking tired
But Flubs isn’t even here
*throws Skarm at Gummy to help him pack*
~~But Gummy was supposed to marry Flubs or Skarm~~
*noms one vr*
*uses a master ball on Entei*
*switches Places With Skarm*
Git gud RC
I was just joking there
Maybe it was the 5% of the time you aren’t sarcastic <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m not hitting vc
*throws red shell at Skarm*
What are you implying Skarm?
...
Is that their name Skarm?
Who keeps chasing you through light years of poison Skarm?
No
No, it didn’t happen birdbrain...
That won’t change anything
Nothing Skarm says makes sense
*switches places with Skarm right before I fall down the stairs*
*rolls around*
*slaps Skarm*
*throws Skarm at Gummy because of boops*
Well, break’s over
He probably doesn’t get paid enough to carry 100 pounds of equipment to one person
🔥
~~I can play the clarinet~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Now you can play a drum roll if we need it~~
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I only played 7 once
I still have it. It’s weird going back to an old Mario Kart after playing 8 Deluxe, with how different the carts control
I have Double Dash, DS, Wii, 8, and 8 Deluxe
I have a break 3 days in a row for work
*forgets to breathe and dies*
The only thing there really is to do on break <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*rolls around*
Even if I do get candy, I don’t eat much of it
*throws Skarm at laffy taffy*
I eat more chocolate and pastries than candy
😐
Break time
😐
*throws Skarm at my job*
Someone else want to work my 8 hour shift for me? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*looks at Flubs* He probably has more nukes <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
But he’s dead
Now what?
*kicks Skarm down the stairs for squeezing me*
*switches places with Skarm right before I fall down the stairs*
*rolls around because reasons*
The cat deserves a treat for that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
If what shut down Skarm? Gummy’s immune system?
*throws Skarm out the window*
No
*throws Skarm at Dragonite to begin the date*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*throws a fish at the thing*
Stop telling me that Skarm
Maybe we should introduce Skarm <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
They will leave even faster <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Maybe I should have a friendly face <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Welcome
Chugga’s 10 Year video was him talking about how he makes a Let’s Play
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P0WmKvVVbGs
*throws punsult at Skarm*
I took it as both a pun and an insult 😛
Fuck you too
What handstore did you get this from Skarm? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t want this hand. And where did you get a hand?
So, I guess I threw Gummy at Dragonite’s pants, since Skarm switched places with him
*throws Skarm at pants*
*throws Fortnite at nothing*
I have never played Fortnite
In this case, I found the episode I needed and I recorded it with OBS Studio because I couldn’t download it
Random thought: For animation reviews, it can be a pain to find the episode you are looking for and finding a way to use it.
😑
Gummy and “good invader” Don’t belong in the same sentence <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh right, The Season 8 Premiere Aired yesterday
Yeah
We both agree on something <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You declared war on the East Coast
You’re mean
Screw New Jersey
More treason
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
He’s talking to RC <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
The bot has a dog? And lives on a farm?
Get some new puns Skarm
*throws that pun out the window*
Hey, I didn’t tell Skarm to eat babies
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
*throws Skarm at Mee6’s new face*
Alright. I’ll PM you mine
Oh, btw, do you want to exchange friend codes? It’s fine if you don’t
Their phone line is so bad, you can’t use it, so we no longer have a home phone. And when we got the modem that they require, it just wouldn’t work once a day for a while
I have Spectrum, which has its shit times too
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
It doesn’t really lag for me
Never mind, you ninny
You don’t need to hide it Skarm. This is hell <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Skarm at Gummy for spying on the 13 colonies*
I want money
*throws Google at Majestic’s bing*
What if Skarm said he wasn’t a robot? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
But you like fire and explosions <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*also throws Skarm at Flubs for no reason*
*gives the guy a rock to sit on*
*throws stop sign at Flubs*
There’s a stop sign at the end of it
It was the exit ramp
And one guy tried to turn right onto the wrong side of the highway and almost ran into one guy sitting there
Caffeine. That’s how you spell it
The Kmart here that’s closing soon is really bare
“Responsibilities suck” Chugga
It’s very relaxing to not have to worry about classes
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
My head hurts a little
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*rolls around since there’s nothing else to do*
A moment of silence for the lost browser tabs
Good night
There
*throws Skarm out the window*
GO AWAY
*noms bagel*
*throws bagel at Skarm*
*switches places with RC*
*throws Skarm at Gummy so they can sleep together*
No
Ok, I’ve done so much today, I think I’ll need to go to sleep really early tonight
Why do you have liquid nitrogen RC?
Get Skarm to do it
Ok, R too <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
They only work on people whose names start with r
Hope you wanted those 4 r’s <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws game at Skarm*
Food time
Skyrim is one of the few things that’s not treason
Mount and Blade is treason. Play Skyrim
Because it’s not here
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
*throws Skarm at Gummy for sneaking*
😑
As I expected, food is taking a while to come out
It’s Gummy
*throws Gummy back here and I run*
I’m not homophobic
Autocorrect: How does “because” become “beverage”?
Because I’m SquidofBaconator
So, why is your name “the Gays”?
I don’t like how hypocritical og Plasma is
And I’m in the restaurant now
We’re waiting in the doorway and it’s cold
We called ahead a half hour before we arrived and we’ve been waiting here for 10 minutes
No <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Stuck waiting at a crowded Texas Roadhouse
It’s more staged for the American audience
Oh, that’s good, even though it can be staged sometimes
~~Cory in The House?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I didn’t help him do this either <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Didn’t Dragonite or someone make it so Skarm mentions me more?
He does that a lot
*switches places with Skarm and also throws Flubs in*
*throws song out the window*
*rolls around*
I’d listen if I wasn’t in public
Oh right
Raven Rock? Is that in Skyrim?
Can anyone here actually play the bagpipe?
Why does a fish make the bot want to destroy Dragonite?
😐
*slaps Skarm with a fish before he noms me*
*noms rock*
*throws puns at Skarm*
Too bad we can’t search how many times you post a gif <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*rolls away*
WAH
*throws bacon at Skarm*
I’m back from early morning work ya Ninnies
I can rarely sleep for 9 hours
I like having an 11-7 sleep schedule
I like sleeping at least until 7
Anyways, I hate having to wake up at 6:30 just to go to work...
Now you’re just whipping a fish
*switches places with a fish*
😏
*somehow Skarm gets thrown too*
*throws a thousand Wauluigi gifs at RC*
That’s 2nd best
Best gif ever
I just use either Splatoon kid or WAHLUIGI
😐
How will video editing help your situation Skarm?
*throws paint on Skarm*
I’m saying Skarm took your money. Probably
No, I think it’s either Dragonite’s or Flubs’s money
Whose money was that? It’s not mine
*makes Skarm nom scoville*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Seconds, minutes, hours, or days?
*rip Dragonite*
I’m still watching through it. They are going over the parts going into it
So, Stephen has a sponsored video out now and... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pIp3R9fUO3Y
You can’t use those; you need to use regular electronics <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms electronicse*
*tapes smirk back on*
*takes away Skarm’s ability to switch places with me*
*throws spatula at Skarm*
In a couple minutes, Skarm will appear out of nowhere and he will do something. I’m not sure what, but we’ll find out when we get to that point <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yet
*uses spell on Gummy*
*magic*
I wonder how much sleep I need to not feel tired
*noms treason*
It’s really treason to eat some other burger
*Uses high level magic to make the god Baconator to destroy all the competition*
*summons Baconators to destroy the pork chops*
I hate pork chops...
THAT ISN’T HELPING
*throws Skarm at the fire to stop the fire*
😐
*ends up rolling into Skarm*
*rolls around*
You are dating the day
*throws fish at Skarm*
*throws fibus at Flubs*
*throws Skarm at physics homework*
*throws potato bombs at jack rabbits*
No one told you to build them Skarm
Who said it was food?
*throws a potato at Dragonite*
I said poke, not build explosives and potatoes
*makes Skarm poke Gummy*
They will be tangled forever <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, that should be kind of obvious
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
F
That’s Animal Man
I’m not an animal
I can’t see it. Your dabbing is covering it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t know who was over there
*throws <:Upvote:316033532537470987> at someone*
Leave me alone
*noms sala*
*switches places with Skarm*
*steals it again and sets it to throw an explosive at Flubs if he tries to take it again and makes it so the mic can’t be harmed and only Flubs can get hurt*
*steals it from Flubs*
~~Can I have it then?~~
Stop what?
Not around here
Don’t you need to go to Subway for a sub? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Twitch?
But I thought you said everyone here is better than Nightshade, Skarm
He thinks it’s funny
Is this it Skarm?
Is Skarm calling Dragonite Satan?
Some freight needs shipping
It’s when we aren’t here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Both <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s treason
*switches places with Gummy*
*throws a fish at Skarm*
Shut up bot
He needs his cactus armor first
So, everyone in <#304082726019923978> is better than Nightshade? Wow Skarm...
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<@239928598696427520> Should the bot be hanging with Sarah? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Put it into Skarm’s phone, ok <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Welcome
*noms shoe*
~~What’s a Let’s Play?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
A name for a male horse, I think
Dammit bot...
*gives Gummy Skarm to break if it will help*
*throws sarcasm from Skarm in the trash*
The bot agrees with it
Because Skarm likes it even more?
*throws a seat belt at Skarm*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
So Skarm, why are you apologizing?
No one cares
~~Your smile. Right Skarm?~~
*throws Kenobi at Skarm*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I like the peanut butter ones
*MY CABBAGES*
*pokes poking*
I also think I still have the boxes for Emerald and FireRed
🎉
Sideways, Dammit...

I have the manual to Platinum
Nintendo should make all the main Pokémon games available on either the 3DS/Wii U virtual console or if the Switch ends up getting a virtual console
You can still get and play them, but to put it simply, it’s a process.
I still got a rom of Emerald
I don’t think they should just be thrown in the trash
On another note, I just got one video fully edited and another is almost done
Nine hours of sleep and still tired
I see you don’t want to be with Flubs
*throws Skarm at Flubs so Flubs won’t be lonely*
It was either listening to a video or making ASMR
I have no idea what you were doing
RC, that will always exist
And he is sending something
*throws Skarm at Minecraft*
😏
GummyxTwitch
You put a stamp on your foot Dragonite? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I like having this discussion
Gen 7: I liked the idea of Alolan forms, but they needed forms of Pokémon outside of Gen 1
Gen 6 was too bland
And it’s my bias that makes it hard to understand why people think Gen 5 is the best
True
I don’t get why so many people think gen 5 is the best Gen
Agreed
I will say, Sun and Moon have some really good elements but also some really bad ones
3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 1, 5
Platinum is definitely better
Favorites: Emerald, HeartGold, Platinum. 
Least favorites: Black, X, and Originals
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Emerald is best
*guesses that Skarm nommed it*
Who is that, Skarm? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You should’ve told him that when he first started nomming things <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws daggers at iron*
*throws bows at iron*
Boring
I never got my crafting skill that high
I think I have only gotten 1 piece of Dragon armor
I didn’t see it; I was at work
Nice try trolling Flubs
~~Should we throw Skarm at him?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
He’s a fucking idiot
😐
Kenobi = Dinner
Well, Skarm is calling everyone Kenobi now
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
How is it not fair when you both agree?
He agrees
You’re not enlightened
You heard him Skarm
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
So Gummy is out of the question...
Ok, would you rather be shipped with Gummy, Skarm?
*ships Flubs with Skarm*
I’m not going to be shipped with anyone
*watches the SS Dragonite run into an iceberg*
😏
*slaps Skarm*
*noms rifle muskets*
Why does Skarm have so many triggers?
*throws Skarm at Google*
*watches Flubs hit Chernobyl*
Lol
So, how was everyone’s day?
That’s from me
I don’t think Skarm understands 😛
*throws a joke book at Skarm*
Do you have any more jokes? You said that a couple times already
And hello to you too birdbrain
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Well, I’m going to work now

And how much you want to cut out
Speaking of Skyrim... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RD5xmXbywfM
FUS RO DAH
I hate spiders
*J’zargo only has so much room to carry things*
😏
*I am sworn to carry your burdens*
I return with cake
*throws Swellow at Gummy*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Speaking of age, I turn 20 in 3 months and I feel old every time I think of it...
Do you have to be at least 13?
I don’t think an 11 year old should be an admin
Lol
*throws Gummy’s military game at a rock*
Was that 3 hours well spent for you? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Now on Audiobook for $4.99~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*points at Skarm for that*
Well, that’s over with. Now what do we do? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What is this thang that you did Skarm?
Read a book <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yeah, I think that’s ridiculous if you go for 8 hours with no break for anything
He said a day; Dr Phil
Random thought: I saw a video where Dr Phil said he thinks playing a video game for 6 hours a day is an extreme problem
Where you go around the corner and wait for a few seconds? <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
“WE KNOW YOU’RE IN THERE” for the 50th time? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
WE DID EVERYTHING
It feels like the older I get, the more arguments there are
And my parents are arguing about something. AGAIN. Something about money
Marriage = divorce a good chunk of the time <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
...What?
In the air (warning shots) or at the house?
Did they break anything?
You serious?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
On another note, I still love puns
Or how about we throw Skarm at his house? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Do we need to give them a battering ram? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
When will they barge in?
Get some cereal <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*slaps Skarm*
*Throws Skyrim at the swat team and makes it look like Skarm did it*
Sending npc’s to attack each other to distract the swat team...
He’s getting away!
*goes and turns Skarm in*
I see Skarm is getting tired of being thrown. <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Skarm at dust*
~~I find you being insulted insulting~~
~~I thought they were there for you~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
*throws something at peta*
*throws gerbil at nothing*
“SuperGummying, Rarity”
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Smirking got me to level up 😃
Lol
😏
I chat here in between races in those waiting rooms
But I play online, so I can’t pause
It’s not easy. I’ve tried
I don’t think Skarm could be related to anyone here except Dragonite
So Skarm. Tell Gummy who he should date so we don’t have to hear it or I will slap you with a fish
😐
*throws Skarm at the dumb phrases*
I still think both phrases are creepy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why was “it means” pinned?
~~You are already crazy~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Never mind
Which song are you referring to?
I’m busy playing FFXV while glancing at Discord
Here’s a good song https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj2vU2nr5Jw
I’d appreciate that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I just felt like saying how long Stephen has been playing that. Which I find pretty ridiculous
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You quit Mario Maker and Stephen has over 600 parts of Morning Mario
Don’t ask
1) Skarm has family?
2) Why was a sock in the dishes?
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
Is he trying to get Panda to do his work?
*throws Skarm at whoever does that in the future*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*goes back even further to destroy all these time machines or however we transport through time so none of this will happen again, comes back to this time and then destroys this last time machine*
*goes back even further and destroys RC’s knife or whatever he stabbed me with*
*goes back in time and noms the rare candies*
It only knows growl <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Ralts at RC*
Nothing
And Skarm still wants to squish a Ralts...
We already know that
My mom’s birthday is Friday
Does anyone actually know Who’s birthday is today?
1) You just realized I’m pink?
2) Why is that relevant Skarm
Very carefully <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Skarm at picklefishlips*
Blah blah
~~Are you sure?~~
😐
Bye
👋
“More qualified individuals” who is qualified in shipping Gummy with a fictional character?
I ship Gummy with Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
People like watching sports and shame people who like esports and lets playing. I hate those people
League is uninteresting to me. Same goes for Esports
Oh. League 😒
TSM?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I’m saying no one other than Gummy talks about the show
I like the show, but I never talk about it here because no one else does, other than Gummy
Why do you hate it?
Lol
How to make Eyan dislike you: talk about MLP
Name yourself Gummy
No
I like the show 😑
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Why are you still naming yourself after ponies?
🤢
I’m not Animal Man
Get me cake Skarm
Ok, I want cake now. But we don’t have cake...
Did Skarm put the body there? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
“Imma so something crazy” 😐
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
🤔
Titanic <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
How should we know? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I never had tic tacs before
Get some garlic bread
My garlic bread...
*throws Skarm at Gummy for mentioning that*
She sounds like a robot
I just tuned the tv to the national anthem before a race and there’s some microphone difficulties 😛
Why are children ALWAYS LOUD?!
Plus, I got loud family upstairs, so I’m just in a pissed off mood right now
And I couldn’t connect to Discord for a few minutes
I think I just suck at video games today
Ok, why is it I get hit by 2 boomerangs, a bomb, and a shell in 5 seconds in MARIO Kart?
Also, I accidentally reported myself again, trying to delete the 1st emoji
😑
Wrong emoji
*noms national anthem*
*throws fire into explosions in between Mario Kart races*
*rip*
I didn’t touch the stomach
*takes steak out of stomach*
How can you be in a suit for 24 hours?
You are no help
Give me something to do Skarm
Well, I’m not sure what to do now
Gnar uoy?
Well, when he comes back, he can slap you <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Skarm at the rock*
I didn’t want to be set on a rock
*gives Flubs rubbing alcohol* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I can start drinking next year
Apparently, the place I work at was the only place in town that still had some corned beef
Yes. I celebrated by working in the morning and not doing anything
How the hell is this a fascinating development, filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti?
You Go away Skarm.
*noms tie*
Better start sleeping now
😐
Why are these people dancing for 10 hours?
Who’s dancing?
Hoirs? What’s that? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*switches places with Skarm*
*throws dark chocolate in the trash, where it belongs*
It’s made out of white chocolate
*noms knife*
And I’m disappointed that Skarm didn’t steal the cookies
Because dark chocolate is bitter
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Make that REGULAR chocolate and I’m in
I will say, I loved Chugga’s “Hilbert” monologue in the 1st episode.
So ugly, it’s cute? I’m guessing that’s the trope
Anyways, does anyone get how Chugga thinks Trubbish is cute? I think he said it looked cute
~~Garbodor is still shit though~~
~~Can we make that a trigger?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I think RC killing me has rubbed off on Skarm
*throws tank out the window* I’m sure it will explode when it falls down 40 floors
The kappa
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Cool down
Why is it, especially recently, when I throw something at Skarm, he murders someone?
*throws Bulskitty alarm at Skarm*
Who put the alarm near me?
You end up doing so. I used to be more of a normal person. Now I throw Skarm at people and slap people with fish.
Get Gummy a date Skarm
😏
He wants you to pm him
And I’ll throw Skarm at you; you can keep him <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
*throws a fish at the name*
Gummy, I don’t need your server for nsfw stuff
Why would I step in the server?
I’ll bet YouTube recommends everyone nothing but Jake and Logan on April Fools day
I need to get my April Fools video record soon, so I at least have it recorded. Now, should I parody one of the Paul brothers for the opening?
I’ll do that for April Fools
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
~~Permanently changing the picture to Wauluigi is always a good option~~
~~Get a better waifu~~
~~I don’t ship it~~
😐
What’s with the name change?
Never mind
Ok, I’m going back to YouTube
*throws Skarm at it*
**NAY**
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
No
What is with that background?
Hey eardrums, Dragonite sends his regards <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m listening to this instead of Stephen&Friends Broken Picturephone. What am I doing with my life?
No class 🍷
Wait, what’s going on? I’m busy watching the latest Stephen&Friends episode
I have trouble talking irl
*throws rock at keyboard*
Now I want cheesecake...
*attempted to nom potato, but Draco took it, so I nommed the stack instead*
I don’t even think Twitch is good
More what?
*dunks on Twitch with Skarm*
*throws idea at Skarm*
What are you talking about?
Uhh, Skarm, I don’t think nomming potatoes is the best thing to do while you get blown up...
*switches places with Skarm*
*blows up a rock*
Lysandre is worse
As a villain, he isn’t good
At least Cynthia was a good character, unlike Ghetsis
No
It’s not just the fight that I dislike
I don’t like Ghestsis.
Ok, is it bad that I feel like going to bed at 6:35?
*throws Star Wars memes at Gummy*
Lol
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
🍔
Yes
My dad just mentioned pancakes
I burned the word “place” down <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*burns place down*
Why would you speak to a liar?
Also, Equestria Daily has a server?
~~Or is it?~~
I only have 4 friends; 3 from this server
<:Treason:396483914803445761>

Since we’re showing servers...
Never heard of it
Compressed mode?
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
😒
I stayed for Blood on the Ice
“SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS”
I can also talk shit about Gen 6.
I can keep talking shit about Gen 5 <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms dinner*
I still don’t get why Emile likes Cryogonal and Garbodor so much
But not enough for me to change my opinion that Gen 5 is the worst
Black and White 2 are a lot better
Colress is good
Everyone else is either meh or bad.
N is the only character I really like from Black and White
^
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I think I don’t want what you give me Skarm
More what?
*Throws N at Gummy. And also throws Skarm at him for no reason*
I dislike Black and White, but N is an actually good part of it
Seriously, why is every Let’s Player getting appendicitis?
He went through a lot in a short amount of time
That
I don’t like the aftergame of Black and White. The level jump is just ridiculous and the new areas don’t interest me expect for the Black and White city
Yes Gummy
Yep, I heard. Just like Stephen 😛
Speaking of Black and White, Chugga just uploaded the finale to Black and White
I still only got a couple hours into Chronicles. I lost interest in it. What a waste of $15
Remember when Chugga showed off he had 20 copies of Xenoblade Chronicles? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Punny. Heh
Why don’t you want Battle Revolution Skarm?
*throws my copy of Battle Revolution at Skarm*
And we can’t forget about the soundtrack
I know one guy who thinks Galaxy 2 is bad and heavily overrated.
*slaps Skarm for Majestic*
It’s because that game is bad. It’s only got good graphics going for it
*throws magic at a rock for no reason*
And they’re just arguing about something. That’s always great to listen to... 😑
I’ll be there when my parents leave, so I’m not bothered
Oh, Eyan’s live. I think I’ll be there, since I didn’t go to yesterday’s stream
I’m guessing Ida would say <:Nay:327308337706434570>
I’ve been wanting to play Emerald again. But, I’m not sure if I want to play with my copy or find a rom like Sigma Emerald or something
I hate being awake at 6:30 just to get ready for work
So you’re messing with yourself? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws cake at RC*
Just tell Gummy who he should date Skarm
Stop telling us that
Ok, a glitch just happened where it looked like Skarm was in other servers saying “This is wrong on so many levels” 😛
Hello Nerd
I doubt you can do that
Good, because I have no idea what the hell Skarm is talking about
I expected no less from the filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Skarm at RC to make him not lazy*
At least your not hurting me
🔪 Watch it
*duck tapes mouth back on*
😏
*inhales air*
Hola
We all confiscated Master?
I didn’t do it RC <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*switches places with Skarm*
Out of context quotes can be funny
Good job Draco

And now Austria is gone
Who needs that when you have Baconators
No, not our sun
*noms 1 thousand suns*
Tacos are overrated <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Baconators are better
*gives Eyan a Baconator*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
*throws bell away*
Dragonite
Said the guy who is level 48 <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Now the chat can become 100% pink if it’s just me, you, Gummy, and Flubs talking <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Welcome
*takes my fish back before I go*
Ok

And I think I will go to sleep now
*throws another music pun and Skarm at the other two ninnies*
*throws a cello into the mix*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
He’d rather yell at the w
*plays a banjo*
*plays worlds smallest violin*
*noms rock*
*switches places with Skarm*
Yes bagpipes
*plays clarinet*
You must not like Pokémon gen 3’s soundtrack if you don’t want trumpets <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*plays trumpet*
If dogs could deliver mail, then mailmen wouldn’t have anything over them
I like dogs
And Demon Lord shows up at the same time
Oh hai Will
Chicken and waffles are great
Bacon hash browns
The lazy people?
*throws nothing at Skarm because I’m too lazy to get something*
I don’t want to use a gun on Draco
lol
That’s the YouTuber
Lost Pause
Sounds dumb. I only watch one YouTuber who does that content regularly
Well, it’s time for my nightly “I have no idea what I should do” time
See?
Absolutely nothing. This is just Skarm loving being random
I’m pretty sure RC has been mean to you Skarm
Fuck you too
Either
😏

😐
How is that tragic for me?
And now he’s insulting Drago
Is he talking about Gummy or RC?
“Failed to load image”
Your dog is not your child
I’m jumping between servers and YouTube
😐
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
😃
*shoves logic down Skarm’s throat*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Is that your new hobby RC? Shoving things down my throat? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Are you singing? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Even so, that’s fucking stupid
We’re all lazy, aren’t we?
I think it’s because I’m lazy and I’m an unhealthy eater
I sleep plenty
Random thought: I feel tired. I hate feeling tired 95% of the time.
Oil-covered?
Back home
*throws Gummy at Skarm very carefully because RC wanted me to*
It’s already expected that switching places is done very carefully <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*switches places with Gummy*
I was thinking the answer is “very carefully” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
How does one confiscate himself? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*throws Skarm out the window*
So, Skarm called me a “she” so he can buy a boring company flamethrower? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Are you calling me a “she”? *slaps Skarm*
And a hello to you Skarm
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Ok then. *rolls away*
Should the bot have the banhammer?
*switches places with Skarm*
It’s been great talking to no one <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And now it’s almost over
Break time once again
Also, the current best seller on the Eshop is the original Super Mario Bros game
“If you see this game at a garage sale for 25 cents, don’t buy it” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And now, you can play BINGO on the Switch 😛
I just love it when I lose 3 matches in a row because the team I’m put in just sucks...
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*switches places with a rock*
Good
I’m glad it wasn’t me for once <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Make up your mind, birdbrain...
If there’s too much Xcom, explode some of it Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Because of Xcom?
Why did Skarm call Dragonite “Eyan”?
*throws the bell at Gummy’s back*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
~~I’m secretly a Dragonite~~
You rang?
Very few new copies exist, probably
Why the fuck would anyone pay $500 for a Pokémon game?
Yeah, I’m pretty sure the GBA bootlegs are the most common
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
😃
Gummy, I wouldn’t trust this person
“Is not not cheap”
Very shady, especially with the bad English
*throws Skarm at nothing*

You made your 1st mistake when you said you were getting Pokémon White <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Oh, I said it 😛

No, stabbing me with a lightsaber will not bring me back to that rank Skarm
He calls Ida by her name
Hello Flubs
I love how he says Squid
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
And now, I’m off to work
I can eat sherbet and frozen yogurt fine <@214587785510780929>
The thing is, I have the money for some of this stuff, but there are a couple things that make me unable to get it
No
I don’t know why, but recently I’ve been wanting to get a microphone or something for making videos; more than usual. But, I won’t be buying anything probably until I move out
I haven’t played baseball in years
So it can’t just be lactose intolerance <@!162952008712716288>
And I love cheese
I drink milk all the time
I vomit after eating ice cream. I don’t know why
No, I’m not lactose intolerant <@214587785510780929>
I forgot we had that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hey, we need that
*throws ice cream at Skarm*
I can’t eat ice cream. Which makes me jealous when I see other people eating it...
Gummy, stop being stupid
I’m playing Splatoon 2 and someone calls them self “mybutt” 😐
Good job RC. You broke everything <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
We already heard that one
*throws bells in the trash*
No
~~Waits for “you rang?”~~
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
It’s probably a bad one
Hmm
*explodes*
*switches places with Flubs*
*throws a broken computer at Skarm*
Fuck you too
Tell us Skarm. Who will Gummy date?
I would rather beat myself to death with a blunt spoon than date Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why would I date you? That’s stupid
Flubs, I guess
Whatever
*makes Skarm say something to react to*
Ok, I don’t know what to do now other than sleep
They have baked potatoes
Fries, yes
Now I want some potatoes
Samples of what?
😏
*shoves penance down RC’s throat*
I went from nomming everything to being forced to nom everything
Why do you keep shoving things down my throat?
And I say <:Nay:327308337706434570>
It really makes a person who actually owns Wii U question what the point was buying these games if they’re going to be re-released 2-3 years later
I still think Nintendo needs to cool it with the ports. I’m not saying don’t have any ports, just don’t flood the system with them
I’m still annoyed at all the ports.
$60 and I only played it for 5 hours
No wait, ARMS for the Switch was a bigger waste of money
What a waste of $20
I still haven’t gotten far in Chronicles. I just lost all interest in playing it
I use my Wii U to play virtual console games. I haven’t touched my Wii U games since June
*switches places with RC*
I have my Wii U in my room. But the Wii games are in the basement
I only use my Wii for playing GameCube games anymore
After 3rd Gym
I used to be pretty good at Pokeathalon. Now, I kind of suck
But if you want to take me on in 8 Deluxe, I’m in
I only played 7 twice
I look away for 2 minutes and Dragonite has so many pinned messages

What’s the r4 system?
But they stole my cookies!
*slaps Skarm and RC with fish*
I got Girl Scout cookies now

Ok, some people don’t even try hiding their balloons. On the bright side, pretty much free coins
Of course he is
I don’t think apps are meant to run on potatoes <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What app?
Next race, I predict last place finish <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
1st time getting 1st place two races in a row
Also, There’s always someone who makes a very “creative” mii. Think of the first part of TheRunawayGuys play Wii Party
Hey, I actually got 1st in a race
I did that more than I wish I did...
Coconut Mall was great, especially when you could see the Miis in the cars 😛
I don’t mind it
RC, you need more Switch games <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
My top 3 most played Switch games are BoTW at over 150 hours, Mario Odyssey at over 50, Splatoon 2 at over 30
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I have 15-20 hours on MK8D
AND WHY DO I RACE AT DOLPHIN SHOALS SO MUCH?!
WHY MUST I GET HIT BY 2 SHELLS AND A FIREFLOWER AT THE SAME TIME
Why is it, when I start doing good, I ALWAYS get hit with 3 items in a row? EVERY TIME
I’ve played Double Dash and Wii a ton
Yeah, the half pipe parts were great. Wish they were still in Wario’s Gold Mine in MK8
I also played DS, which is my least favorite out of those 4
I do remember getting a lot of time out of Mario Kart Wii and Double Dash too
And now you guys are making me want to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Again
Are you referring to the originals on the virtual console?
So, why don’t they do GBA games on the 3DS?
What is the ambassador program?
Now I’m upset...
So, I’m impatiently waiting for it to come out on 3DS virtual console. Flubs, I just don’t feel like it
But, the battery dried out so clock based events don’t occur
I still have my copy of Emerald
Did she get it yet?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*throws Flubs out the window*
This is why you don’t buy US Pokemon games from a guy in CHINA
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Where are you looking?
One wants to expand land. One wants to expand the sea. That’s the base part of the story
Team Aqua and Team Magma
The originals have the least story out of all the games
Yes, both do
Do the originals really have a story?
I think Emerald is better
Actually, Gold was my 1st game period. But just Pokémon
And I still like HeartGold more
Gold was my first
No
So, Skarm imploded himself?
😐
*throws gold hearts at Flubs. And also Skarm for no reason*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Gold? HeartGold? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
^
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Magic
Just replace it with the Switch and it’s more relevant <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Anyways, the really old games can use remakes for having outdated graphics and mechanics
If the remakes didn’t add new stuff, what’s the point?
<:FailFish:372152438355918848> <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Houndoom is best Pokemon
I didn’t agree with some of this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=butwGwCgvfI
Anyways, I recently watched a video from someone I’m subscribed to who didn’t enjoy Platinum
Turn down your screen brightness then <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Platinum is great
Burn Black and White.
For example, I like HeartGold better for updating graphics and the battle system
It worked once, but other times, it either took forever or it just wouldn’t work
I could never get it to connect to my DS to move Pokémon
I got mine for a little more, I think. It came with the PokeWalker
Is Explorers on there too?
I got Blue Rescue Team on the virtual console
Why the fuck is it so expensive?
😨
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*throws a fish at RC’s computer*
Because Preston Garvey
*noms potato*
I can’t believe it’s not butter <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Now I can blow everything up <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*explodes Flubs*
*lives*
*throws Pokémon Black and White out the window*
Pin worthy
HeartGold is best
No
Bootleg copies, to be specific
Does it involve treason?
“Another settlement needs your help. I got beaten up with it and the people there are all hurt”
Perfect <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
“At least it’s not raining” Preston Garvey
That’s why you need to play the actual game
What would you know Skarm?
I’m not dying inside another person
Hey, everything is fine, now that I got all the sugar in me
*noms 10 pounds of sugar because of how sour the lemons are*
*noms lemons*
*also eats the gumballs*
*switches places with Gummy*
I’m glad we’re on the 40th floor <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws the trigger out the window*
*throws Skarm out the window and then locks the window*
He just shrugs it off... 😑
*slaps Skarm with a fish*
And you’ll need a ton of coins if you want all the outfits
Wow, you can really earn a lot of coins in Balloon world
The internet is always shit. But my connection is fine <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🎉
*slaps straw with a fish*
Why a straw?
Very carefully is the answer for almost anything <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
EBay and China raised 2 red flags when you said them
So, what did you end up getting?
He can’t make it work
The moment you said EBay
I knew something bad would happen
Why would China have US copies?
Japanese versions?
I didn’t give you any money
*throws Skarm out the window and into the snow*
Fuck you
How many times do I have to tell Skarm that I DON’T WANT HIM
😐
Speaking of sleep, I slept for 9 hours today.
The opposite of being awake <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*just runs away because I don’t feel like doing this all night*
*makes me switch places with RC, then makes RC and a fish switch places*
*switches places with a rock*
Because I threw it at him <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s broken
I do like golf though
*throws Wii remote at Gummy*
But that would probably be paid DLC <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I wish there was at least one new Kingdom in the update
Nice pun 😛
You blame it on me and Bella gets punished <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I didn’t poke you
*switches places with Skarm*
*gives RC his door back*
🚪
Anyways, the Switch has a new update
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
A lot of 200cc coming up and it’s difficult
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
*dodges with boo and sees the shells hit Skarm*
Git gud scrub
But now, I’m shit
I’m normally decent
Ok, I don’t get it. All of a sudden, I’m awful at Mario Kart. I feel like a person who has never touched a video game before
“I hope they have lots of SPAGHETTI!”
😏
Other solution: download the app
With how disappointing Smash on the Wii U was, I don’t plan on buying it until I see what it offers
I don’t preorder video games
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Oh look, Dragonite’s about to blow up
*grabs all of Flubs’s explosives and blows up the FBI*
*blows the hardware store up*
Is the PS4 at the hardware store?
*shrug*
😐
*runs away*
Irrelevant
Get Skarm to do it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I don’t know why, but Autocorrect wanted Eyan to be “Ryan”
Just be like me and not care about Twitch outside of watching Eyan’s streams <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
“Clavicus gave him an axe”
*watches every country form an alliance and Gummy immediately loses*
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Hockey with a soccer ball, duh <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
GET BACK HERE
*throws Skarm at TTG to destroy it*
NEIN
No soccer
Wii Bowling? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Also, Skarm didn’t do anything
Lol
*throws Skarm at Gummy*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Because it would be hilarious
😏
Doubt it
I think I might make a video on my dislikes on Black and White
~~I still hate Gen 5~~
I blame Skarm for everything <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m pretty sure if I acted like some of the ways I do here in Stephen’s server, people would think I’m insane
I’m crazier here than in other servers
That makes you like Skarm; the personality disorder <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Speaking of Kirby, I played the demo of Star Allies. It’s ok, just not worth $60 in my opinion
Oh, now I see it
RC, what’s your profile picture of?
Want to get Flubs to burn all the merch?
*also claps, but for no reason*
Also, Skarm is trying to use commands again.
Apparently, today is National Napping Day
No, you’re on the other side of the world
*takes all of the snow away from me and dumps it on Skarm*
It’s going to snow again tonight and tomorrow. I’m really fucking tired of snow
Not really the reaction I’d expect, but I’m fine with it 😛
*throws explosive sushi at Skarm*
Flubs, what did you do to the sushi? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’ve only had sushi once in my life
~~Hasn’t Skarm always been broken?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t want that
Give us your food, Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That escalated quickly
*throws pineapple at Skarm because Draco loves it, I think*
*tosses pineapple to Majestic*
Gives Flubs Skarm before I go to keep him company
*goes to sleep*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I really wish sleep wasn’t a necessity
I really should sleep too, but I don’t want to. But I don’t feel like I can stay up much longer...
Flubs will be normal when pigs fly <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
No
WILL YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND, SKARM?!
So, Skarm wants Gummy to be a bot
WAAAAH
Ok, I really fucking hate how we were winning until 2 teammates die and then just jump and run in circles around the spawn point for the last 30 seconds
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
You can still do so
If you played Splatoon 2 THAT much in less than a year, you should dominate over the competition
That guy was the worst player on our team. HOW?
Someone is level 97 in Splatoon 2 😨
*destroys RC*
Wow, the fan for the Switch is so loud in handheld mode...
No
*noms Draco*
But I wanted that...
I quickly switched to the electric armor
**I have fully upgraded fireproof armor from BoTW**
**now we only have this**
~~Did you get an achievement?~~
Dragonite, do you want some gumballs? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And now he’s talking to Bella?
The bot made it to 12th grade?
*switches places with Gummy*
Anyways, all Skarm gave me was a sandwich
His classmates made a deal about this?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*does nothing to Skarm because I’m bored yet too lazy to do anything*
Detect is great if you use it in Mystery Dungeon
But I found the Darkrai fight the toughest. I have never beaten it. I usually stop playing by the time I get to the Dark Crater
Like Dialga, you need like 10 reviver seeds to beat them
That was a fucking pain
I thought the voice they gave him in the special wasn’t good
Was about to ask that
Yeah
Although, the pacing in Super Mystery Dungeon was worse
I think that was at least a little better
Yep
Anyways, I think that twist with Munna was pretty predictable. Especially when the last game did that twist, but a lot better
A lot of people think it’s the weakest Mystery Dungeon. While I do prefer Explorers of Sky and Super Mystery Dungeon more, I’m not sure if I like the originals more
Oh. Gates to Infinity.
When was Ninnies said in the game? I don’t remember

Us throwing each other? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws Gummy at Dragonite*
😏
That won’t stop you from getting hit with a door
*switches places with Skarm before I get hit with a door*
Ok, I’m just going to play FFXV more. I love this game
Almost to level 66 <:WutFace:327309186432237569>
😒
Lurkers don’t talk as much as you do
Some people might say more
We’ll be getting more snow in a day or two
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hNxM7f8NUgw
I didn’t steal that from you
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Who you calling uncultured? 🍷
The inverted colors
What? How come I never heard of this? 😛
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I’m still going to eat a Baconator for my April Fools video
So Kugal lives in the underworld? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
These don’t have games in them
I like Splatoon
I’m not in the ocean
*watches Master roll into Skarm and then Skarm rolls into the ocean*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
2) I don’t feel like it
1) I’m not home
Bob Ross? Ok <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
Well, I’m getting really bored. Again. What should I watch?
You use it to draw 4 cards
I doubt it will get accepted, since I’m not a great artist, but still
I actually submitted a card for 1KBWC that was “Press 4 To Talk” since Alex kept doing that and he draws 4 cards
They’re honestly Stephen’s funniest videos
I love just watching a bunch of Stephen&Friends videos
I don’t have interest in it
I’m not even playing Balloon World
Clip balloons
How do you do that?
Are you able to link your Twitter account to your Switch or Nintendo Account?
I never told you to stop time
Hey Skarm, say something. I’m bored
Oh. I didn’t play it
Anyways, what game are you referring to?
He’s going to do it now
I wasn’t asking you...
~~Flubs, why did you give Skarm a bombfish?~~
No
*dodges Bombfish*
Which is why you need to get to Pink Nu as fast as you can <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
🎉
Awaits what?
*throws Skarm at Black and White*
I take the anime into consideration with each gen
3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 1, 5
I consider the originals AND X&Y genuinely bad
For me, the worst games are Black, X, and the originals
I’m sure we will be in the phase of hating on X&Y soon. They have always been near my least favorites
Anyways, I think Chuggaaconroy’s Let’s play has helped with making more people say they like it
That will go over well <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
*makes a long video talking about how bad it is* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It feels like more and more people are saying they love Black and White. I miss the days when more people disliked it, like me
Ok, so earlier today, I had to wait 8 minutes at McDonald’s just for chicken tenders. And they ended up giving me the wrong sauce with them
Ok, I’m really going now
No wait, we are on the 40th. We moved down from the 80th when people kept dying
Since when were we on the 10th floor?
I CAN FLYYYYYY 💀
I threw rude at the bot, not a person
*throws rude at RC and Skarm then runs*
I’m just going to sleep now
*cuts vines with large scissors so Skarm can’t watch them*
*noms useless parts of code*
Deleting messages with not much wrong with them is just plain rude
Yes
*throws deodorant back* Skarm needs this more
*sets Skarm next to Dragonite to keep him company*
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Flubs*
Flubs, you’re really liking the your mother jokes, aren’t you?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
It’s pretty violent
Until what?
More 4th wall breaking
It was a picture of a Baconator
*throws something at Skarm for thinking stuff made sense back then*
Don’t bring me into this
Cooldowns are the enemy to Ninnies who like messing with bots everywhere
*stabs Skarm*
*throws potatoes at the starch cannon*
Except when it’s violence against me. Then you’re never lazy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Dragonite? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
The W is lazy...
What did the W ever do to you Skarm?
That’s not lewd
*waits for Skarm to attempt his lewdness*
*moves Gummy closer to Flubs so Flubs can be a kinky role model for Gummy* <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
Kinky role model? <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
I love it when this happens <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Now, if you’re talking about stuff between Gummy and Flubs... <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
Nothing
*Go be violent to someone other than me Skarm*
That works for both of our messages 😛
*watches Skarm do something violent that RC is thinking of*
*bonks Skarm on the head with a fish*
You will never get a video to 1 million views Skarm
I don’t think Skarm will ever give Gummy someone to date
*noms sandwich*
I see Flubs changed his profile picture to Luigi dabbing. I approve 95%. It would be 100% if it was Wauluigi
Splatoon 2 Splatfest time
I’m sure it was easy to get to, Idk
That reminds me: I never checked on the one balloon I left before not touching Odyssey in weeks
Ah
You can get stars/moons from Balloon world?
I was like that last Tuesday
Anything in particular?
I just felt like saying that. RC, could you stop saying how much you don’t give a shit about what I say? It may only be the 2nd time, but it’s starting to annoy me...
His video is #1 on trending
Honestly, with Smash being confirmed, I’m more interested in watching the hilarious, over the top reactions that almost everyone is having
For me, I only plan to watch a Let’s play of Detective Pikachu on YouTube
It really does feel like the bot has multiple personality disorder <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Or not
I think Skarm wants me to repeatedly break him <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*breaks Skarm without trying like Draco*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Hello Draco and Kugal
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Ok, break’s over. ~~Don’t~~ Burn the place down while I’m gone
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*throws Skarm at Gummy’s luck*
I get the 2 days mixed up
Whatever 😒 I have to remind myself because I usually forget if we turn the clocks forward or backwards on some day.
We gain more daylight
The clocks go forward an hour
Did you guys know Daylight Savings Time is tomorrow?
Break time
I really hate having to be up this early to have to go to work for 8 hours...
I really didn’t steal the crown. I probably stole something else that I can’t remember, but not the crown
I didn’t steal anything
Who stole the crown?
*noms sniper rifles*
*switches places with Gummy*
*gives RC Skarm because I don’t have any more money*
*cuts penny in half and gives it to RC*
Would a penny be enough? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Make Flubs do it
I’m not doing that
I think he’s talking to you, Skarm
*looks at our resident buffoon*
*throws a kit kat at RC*
*grabs a k-it kat*
Try what?
And RC is skyui now <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Skarm spends his time confiscating himself when he’s not murdering?
😐
*Wait’s for Skarm’s answer*
He’s either climbing up vines or he’s watching vines roll back up the tree
I believe so. Right, Skarm? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, it’s not him. He’s too busy watching vines
*quickly looks at Skarm*
*falls off a cliff*
*rolls around for no reason*
Even talking about treason is treason
Because everything is treason <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And apparently I’m committing treason again
I’ve only been in VC in another server twice
Around 10-12, I think. Idk
I doubt it
I’m pretty sure a lot of people do
*slaps Gummy with a fish for using my joke*
Anyways, I’m watching a crowd reaction to the Nintendo Direct and they went fucking insane at the Smash Bros announcement. Almost as big as when they reacted to Metroid Prime 4
A character in MLP <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*takes back Baconator*
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
Well, I’m bored. Skarm, say something interesting
2 pins in a row about pants. Let’s make it 3
How does that work? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Editing videos always takes longer than I think it will before I start it
But I didn’t mention that
*makes Skarm kill the ants*
I said it HASN’T been 2 hours
10:45
Ok, it hasn’t been 2 hours since I had lunch yet I’m already hungry
🎉
*burns down Gummy to make Dragonite not dissapointed*
Speaking of slumber, I’m going to sleep
Are we really living or are we just in an eternal slumber? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Yes
Which means you would be dead
You wouldn’t even be able to move without muscles
😐
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Papercuts can’t kill you. Unless they slice open a vital organ
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
You could make them permanent if you quickly take a screenshot
*burns Snapchat* There was no use to that anyways
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
How about you get Fulbs to help instead of Flubs?
Those guys over there
Them
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
No
Depends on how you make it
Elbow macaroni? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*burns Flubs’s pants*
🍝
I already have pants
No
I don’t know
No, I got my own
What are yo- excuse me, I need pants
They are on
*powers come back, rips off rope, and throws Skarm at RC*
Too late
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
Does Dragonite ever want to do it? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I expected that
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Exactly
Ok, I have a better idea
*makes Skarm clean the vomit up*
BlueJ
Because math
^
~~No, RIGHT person~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*gives Skarm poisoned Baconators because he likes what we give him*
*Makes Skarm do Master’s homework*
🍑
Ok, Skarm. Why take Marine Biology?
Flubs, Let’s ask the real question here: Why would Skarm take Marine Biology?
Wrong person
*throws Skarm at Gummy’s ears*
*slaps Skarm with Kenobi*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I say it’s a port because Nintendo is really port crazy with the Switch
I’ll take that as a no
Are you dead Skarm?
Ok, I’m going to play video game. Be back in an hour
Fuck you too, birdbrain
So, Skarm doesn’t want to be rebooted 😛
Yeah, I think that was obvious (Inklings) <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Or does he?
I will always get hurt by Skarm
*makes sure Skarm doesn’t do what RC wants*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Ok, I haven’t eaten anything in almost 6 hours and I’m still trying to figure out if I’m hungry or not feeling good. Idk
Even if the game is good, Nintendo still needs to balance out ports and new titles
I’m still sick of ports
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh, and here’s something I’ve been wanting to say: THERE. YOU GOT YOUR SMASH BROS GAME FOR THE SWITCH COMING. SO NOW YOU CAN STOP COMPLAINING
Currently watching the Direct. I didn’t expect Crash Bandicoot or South Park games to be on the Switch
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Don’t~~ Burn the place down while I’m gone.
Ok, break is almost over.
Ok, Skarm saying puns is reminding me of the puns Codsworth said in Fallout 4
I don’t get that pun
I don’t care about your long and pointy.... I don’t care about it Skarm
*watches Flubs or Skarm burn it down right after I say that* <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I see the server hasn’t been burned down yet. I’m disappointed <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Break time
*super toilet*
😏
I think NinnyofBaconator works better <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hello Animal ~~Ninny~~ Man
In English please
Idk
~~Are we eating chicken?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws bold words at Skarm*
I wonder if Skarm will ever answer Gummy’s question
Never heard of it
I think he wants us to burn the place down <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*switches places with Skarm*
*throws a cup of Java at Dragonite*
You’re weird
No, I’m string aSquid = “SquidofBaconator”;
I didn’t change it
Don’t ask
I haven’t *censored* in a really long time either
And there’s a semicolon at the end of everything
Str just looks weird
My name is too long now
*blames Skarm for everything*
I thought I was a Squid
Why am I a string now?

What do you mean by string length?
String length?
I’m not <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
He doesn’t even know why
And Skarm is ranting about Deci for some reason
I think RC secretly hates me or he just loves killing me for no reason
Why did you shoot me?
It snowed here, but most of it didn’t stick
Did we really need New Jersey? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

The big downside of Netflix and Amazon: they made people even more lazy than they already were. And this is coming from someone who is really lazy
Lazy...
Nowadays, people are like “YOU HAD TO LEAVE YOUR HOUSE TO GET A MOVIE?! WHAAAAAAT?!”
I played a lot of different games thanks to Blockbuster
It’s the only one I have. I did play it on the GameCube when Blockbuster was still around
I hope the Mario Tennis ends up good. The last one I got was on the Wii. I skipped the one on the Wii U
I will. I’d just like to watch it live
When I get home from work, it’ll be over 😑
New Direct tomorrow

It feels good to finally start recording another video after a couple weeks of not doing anything for YouTube
You know what, I’m just going to bed now
When?
Wait, what are you talking about? I didn’t mention lewd stuff <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Depends on the pics 😏
😏😏😏
No
More pics 😏
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
I blame Skarm for this
Why do we keep switching places again?
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>

Wasn’t it $40?
It’s a good game

<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*cough* FFXV is great
*cough* Buy it
😏
No it’s not
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
😐
I thought Skarm loved you RC
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
What are you referring to?
Or not...
Actually, Skarm having multiple personality disorder would make a lot of sense <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t get it
Am I right Skarm?
I think he doesn’t really want to, based on that sigh
My guess was Dragonite
*throws Skarm at all of that to destroy them all*
*goes back in time before that and questions what the hell I’m doing with my life and takes away RC’s abilities to take away my abilities and also destroys RC’s time machine and makes my time machine only work for me*
*goes back in time even further and takes away RC’s confiscating abilities*
*goes back in time before that and switches places with a fish from back then*
🍑
*takes RC’s un-switching powers away from him and makes it impossible for him to relearn them*
He likes explosions
*switches places with Flubs*
*makes Skarm not refer to himself in 3rd person*
Of course that’s the odds
3rd option: appreciate what I’m saying before I kill you for trying to kill me
Why is it when I say something good about you, THAT’S when you kill me...
Making Skarm say puns was a great idea
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
But how did he get one of my Baconators?
This guy gets it
*throws Skarm at Flubs to “help”*
You just really love killing me, don’t you RC?
😐
*dodges stab and watches Skarm get stabbed*
*still lives*
*cough* Gen 5 is my least favorite *cough*
Nah. I played the demo. Doesn’t seem worth spending $60 on it
I still find Black and White mediocre. And I just find most of the soundtrack ok. A few really good ones, but I do find it overrated
I got FFXV for $8 thanks to a gift card
That took forever when I downloaded it.
I’ve always been impatient
Yay
*takes back what I said about Skarm*
But I’m not trying to be mean, you damn bot...
*applauds Skarm for puns*
Seems like this joke is still going on
I’m back from work and I’m pretty irritated
*rolls down stairs to the register*
Oh well. Back to work I go...
The only way I can look at this is that I’m getting more money
The supervisor called her later and said she could forget clocking in until she talks to our boss
From what I heard, she was a no-show Sunday. She first called and said she couldn’t work, she got a court summons. But, the supervisor who answered the call called her out and said that the courts are closed on Sunday
I wasn’t even supposed to work this long today, but there’s a situation with another coworker that made her not work this week
I got 10 more minutes of my break left
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
My feet aren’t interesting. Unless you have a foot fetish...
And I’m the only one here. Skarm, say something interesting
Time to eat a lot and then get really tired and not want to go back to work
Break time
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Xcom is just making me confused...
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
Garlic bread is why Skarm can’t talk for 30 seconds?

Why not?

And now RC went from being Eyan to being Animal Man <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Why am I getting hurt here?
No one
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
But if everything is treason, then everyone is committing treason, which means it’s ok to kill them with artillery
Gummy, don’t kill people on your side. That’s treason
*joins in stabbing Skarm*
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
What information?
🔪 Don’t come near me birdbrain
I didn’t nom anything yet, so I can’t have glass shards in my body

I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Well, it looks like I’ll be working more than I thought this week...
If Skarm didn’t have so many messages of hurting/killing me, we wouldn’t be in this situation <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*slaps Skarm with a fish for liking being thrown at me*
Don’t like this
Whatever. I’m used to it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

*makes Skarm do something interesting*
Ok, I just ate cake
Autocorrect is made to fuck everything up
...what?
I’ll take that as a yes
What do the bull videos have to do with this?
Tell me what?
But still
Hey, I’m not the only one who dies here.
He just scrolls up...
*sees what happens with Skarm if a death counter is put in*
Meh. Whatever floats your boat
Not my entire life. I dedicate that to Baconators <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Fish. Not humans
RC, I will always be able to find more fish, no matter how many you confiscate
*throws a fish at the point*
I slept for over 8 hours
Coming from the guy who says sleep is for the week
I doubt I’ll ever get enough sleep
I hate getting enough sleep yet I still end up taking a nap
A while ago, Stephen posted a gif of the moment in the new GTA Online where him and one other person were pelvic thrusting. We were all confused then. But now, it all makes sense

Yeah, I just got to that part. I still have to watch the Patreon video afterwards.
Ok, I’m going to go back to the new Stephen&Friends GTA Online episode
But his grammar still sucks
Ok, that’s a good pun 😛
Not even the bot understands himself
As always, I never understand Skarm’s logic
Does nomming phone steak help you beat the villain?

Do we have to set everything here on fire? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh good, Skarm is back. Now we can hear the stupid stuff he says again <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Come on, level up
🎉
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Does that mean you will need 10 fish?
I still think throwing stuff at bugs should help our problem <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws a fish at the bug*
*throws something at the bot*
And he’s still down
Ok, will someone chat so I can level up? I don’t just want to be talking to Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I think I’ll leave it until I get home <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m really close to another level up

Ok, I’m going to get ready for work. See you Ninnies in a few hours

So get warm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Just when I think the power will stay on, it goes off for a couple minutes...
Huh. I’ve never had that happen in BoTW
Ok, I’m going to sleep
Can’t Skarm go back to being lewd to RC or Gummy again?
Don’t !hmm me
And stay away from me Skarm
I’m just going to go to sleep
🤢
*throws Skarm at RC*
*Throws arm at RC*
It may have blown my arm off, but it’s worth it

Because it’s how he will get the bronze armor <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Then mention me more Skarm.
What does the graph say Skarm?

Now hopefully, he doesn’t just do that to me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

We do have a generator, but we don’t want to turn it off yet because as soon as we do, the power will go out again
I’m only here right now because the power is back on and I’m using it as long as we have it
I didn’t watch it because I didn’t want to use too much of my data
We have wind
Do you have power?
Hello Flubs

The automated message from the electric company said it wouldn’t be restored until 11pm on Sunday
Earlier today, it was just for half an hour

Ok, I’m going to let my phone charge. Be back in a couple hours probably
Yes, by me. Even if I’m a Baconator

Another thing: the power being out has made me more tired than usual
Ok, I’m just going to stop talking here so I don’t use up all my data
I don’t know a thing about making games or using RPG Maker, so I would lose interest fast
I’ll just play on my Switch and 3DS
I hate having to disconnect from our WiFi and use data just to go on the internet because the power is out, but I feel like I’ll go crazy from boredom if I don’t do something
I’m not going to even bother watching the stream
Ok, the power constantly going on and off is really fucking irritating
Be there in a few
Stream now? Hopefully the power doesn’t go out again while I watch it
I’d say bad
Power is out again...
We only got 15 MPH
And it’s not even as bad as the east coast
Yep
Ok, the power stopped going on and off

I just love how there’s always that one guy who is really far ahead of everyone else
I have good internet, I think my Switch is just in a bad position. This is why a paid online service can be good
Ok, now my connection sucks for some reason
On another note, I’m usually bad at online
One round, 200cc. The next, 150cc. Then, maybe mirror
Cc is what I’m referring to
How fast it is is random
I will say this: I think Smash is overrated. It’s fine, I just don’t think it’s as great as a lot of other people think

Now you won’t be able to eat
😏
You get to suck things up all the time
So, does the <:Downvote:316033532684140544> mean you want us to be nommed?
Don’t nom us
Are you still an Animal Man? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Said by the guy who has shot me in the past *looks at RC*
He wasn’t when I said that...
Nope
I wonder if filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti will work
*throws garbage at Skarm since he can’t object to it right now*
“Eel Man”
*steals something from RC*
*watches all this go down* 🍿
🎉
If you’re ok Skarm, say something
The bot ain’t responding
*Looks at Skarm for that*
~~If you lost it, then go find it~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ah
Wait, who lost what?
Well, that escalated quickly
~~Tell that to Eyan~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Same
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832> Bella
I know you anger Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*watches Dragonite angrily run after Gummy*
🎉
*throws Flubs at Flubs*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*rolls back to work* See y’all later
*Looks at Skarm, disapproving*
That does nothing for me
Hey Skarm, say something to put me in a better mood
Since it’s the first of the month and a snow storm is coming tomorrow
Break time and it’s really fucking busy here
It makes me feel like I was just there
It feels like I was just at work last night and I have to go back later this morning
*rolls around*
I was asleep for 6 hours, wake up, then slept for 2 1/2 more hours and I’m still tired
👋
Yep. I’m probably going to be tossing and turning until my usual time
Ok, I’m just going to try and get some sleep early tonight
The one rule of Mario Logic: Make no sense whatsoever
I would’ve liked if they at least made a joke about it
This is MARIO logic we’re going with
*makes Skarm and Gummy marry each other on the moon*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832> Will
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*switches places with Gummy and locks RC in a bunker where he can’t switch places with anyone or make others switch places with each other*
He’s not here at the moment, so he can enjoy that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*switches places with Flubs*
And now Skarm is trying to kill RC
On another note, I don’t get how I feel really tired when I’m sitting in a recliner downstairs, but when I get in bed, I’m not tired.
Don’t just shrug this off
*tests Skarm’s sanity level*
I don’t think Dragonite wants gamma waves
*Looks at Skarm for this*
How should I know? You started it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*shoots RC*
Yeah, Gummy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Or is it?
Isn’t that when he’s racist?
He just wants to be left alone to grow potatoes, I guess
If I teamed, would you have murdered me Skarm?
*Steals any other money Skarm has*
It says “ad 1 of 2” on the screen
Are you guys having 2 ads play on some videos instead of just one?
I’m not going to sleep
How many hands are you collecting Skarm?
Hey Skarm, do you like Gummy?
He’s lost it again
Now he’s focused on Gummy again
😏
I’d prefer Skarm trying to kill me over him being lewd to me
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
You were in VC?
*breaks the lock and throws Skarm at Flubs*
NONONONONONONONO
The bot is breaking the 4th wall again
The filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti is offering you his hand in marriage <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
🔪
*throws broken laptop at Skarm*
Go do that instead
Stay out of this Skarm. And no one can watch, especially you
I better get a girl
More answers? You haven’t given us any, filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti
*makes Skarm answer us*
Hey Skarm, who has pics of Stalin?
Gummy, why is your nickname...that?
What does makeup have to do with anything, filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti?
*throws Skarm at RC*
Biased
Will you shoot Flubs now too?
😏
I don’t think I’ll ever buy a PS4 or any new system from Sony
*The more you know*
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Looks almost like bacon
What’s sala?
*takes the sandwich Skarm stole*
My day was on the low side of meh
So, did everyone have a better day than me?
Yes
No, I’m home
I had to work longer than I was supposed to; someone called in sick
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*waits for Skarm to get violent like he always does*
*noms book*
There’s an enemy in which you throw your hat at it; it catches it and then it runs after you. It explodes when it runs into something
I just haven’t been able to aim the enemy right
I was never able to break that cage
The one place I did try was the Lost Kingdom. The balloon was on one of the faraway platforms
I only really care about the new outfits
Meh. I don’t really care about it
You can either hide a balloon in one of the worlds and have people try to find it or you find one of their balloons
Honestly, the balloon mode just doesn’t really interest me at all
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Mother 3 has never been released in America
~~What about the beloved Metroid: Other M?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Me neither
WAHLUIGI NEEDS A GAME.
I would be pissed off if they did that
I don’t want gen 8 to happen at least until 2020
*plays more music*
Flubs, get someone to get you food
I’m saying that not wanting to talk to people is a reason people could be on their phones. Someone might be addicted, some might just not like talking. What I’m trying to say is that being addicted is just one outcome
NONONONONONONONONO
I want food
Yes
😏
I’m sure some people really are addicted to these things, but you can’t just assume people who would rather be on their phone for a few minutes than talk to people they don’t care about are addicted
Maybe people just don’t like others, like me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Seriously, just because you do something doesn’t mean your addicted
Pfft
I’m not addicted to my smartphone
*dabs at Wolverale to annoy*
I thought you were a Flubs person
I like pot roast with mashed potatoes and gravy
I like chicken and fish too
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
*watches everyone start running at Panda*
How is it?
Has anyone eaten at In n Out?
Now I want to try In n Out
Honestly, most hot dogs aren’t good
Bella, what do you recommend then?
Eat there
*Builds a Five Guys in Canadaland to show Gummy a good burger restaurant*
Ok, Burger King really isn’t good
😡
*Gives Gummy a Baconator*
Every time I mention another server, that’s treason
💀
<:Treason:396483914803445761> <:Treason:396483914803445761> <:Treason:396483914803445761>
🎉
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
You’re joking right Gummy?
You don’t watch that Super Skarmory guy?
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
We know
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
This will never end
*throws deodorant at the filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti*
*puts Gummy into counseling with Skarm*
I didn’t do anything
Great, RC caused the destruction of the Kingdom to start. With the help of the filthy heap of metal binary spaghetti
Mine is 10 1/2 or 11. Depends on the shoe
I thought it was 7 3/4
Maybe I wanted it RC
Isn’t that what a burrito is? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*takes confiscated whiskey*
Pick someone Gummy should date Skarm
The person is evolving
😏
HA
*Throws a Baconator at Skarm*
TACO
He just loves talking about squishing Ralts
What is it now Skarm?
Now I want fries...
That’s a weird reaction to being hit with a shield
*dodges and watches it hit Skarm*
I was throwing it away from me because Flubs put a bomb on it
*throws Cobalt shield at nothing*
No
Uhh... Skarm. Why do you have plastic food?
*steals all of the bots stolen sandwiches and cookies*
*Declares war on Dragonite-guruofscrewingland and throws Skarm at it*
Tacos and burritos are overrated
*noms sheep*
The guy with food in his name should know some of this stuff
Nice pin
Don’t lose your intestines. You won’t be able to eat without all your digestive organs
You better just get someone to get you a burrito
🤢
Because you fall?
Mexican food is overrated. Except for nachos
Great, now I’m hungry because Gummy mentioned food
The Same Group. And Brad <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Same
What game?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
The bot picks Benny
*makes Skarm pick someone*
No Skarm. Emerald is the best
That’s...bad right?
*noms something*
Hey, leave me out of that Dragonite
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
😐
Leave Ida out of this
*throws Skarm at Gummy to stop him from whining*
I doubt it was
Cash that is hard
I want some money <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m 142
Why not?
I come back to that 😐
We needed 21 minimum at my school. A lot of us made them up <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh, I didn’t know that <:LUL:305559915714576385>
Ok, so apparently, the door didn’t close because the sun was shining on the sensors
*noms python*
I just pressed the button now and it went down fine. I don’t fucking get it. It’s done this before
My dad should be home soon. He can figure it out
The garage door opener isn’t working. I press the button, the door goes does a little, stops, and goes back up. Then the light flickers a few times
I just love it when the garage door doesn’t close
Very carefully <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Advice from Flubs: “Blow everything up” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*waits for Skarm to be violent*
It really is a bad song
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_IZcoiPiXS8
Stop being lewd to me Skarm
I see Skarm’s violent tendencies are rubbing off on Gummy now
Gummy’s being rude again
Same
I’m surprised Skarm hasn’t nommed anything yet
*noms safe eating*
You got a typo
It may not hep, but it helps
Very carefully
*noms nice*

It has a sequel on the Switch
A Nintendo game
I thought so <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Is he?
Why would your mom be here? 😛
I forgot what standard deviation means and I learned it just a couple months ago
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>

Don’t cal me
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Cal?
*awaits Skarm to team up with RC to do violent things together*
I think the bomb that exploded was somewhere else
But I’m still here
Ok, it’s the Pink Panther <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Or Fibus? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Fulbs?
😏
😛
...yanwysa
Anyways...
~~Like shit?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You should eat more than that
Then let me win
It’s not
Get away from me birdbrain
*throws Skarm at mount and blade*
*noms Ocarina*
*makes it rain*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Who put a bomb there?
What?
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
It’s about as good of a learning center as Skarm
😏
*throws raccoon at Gummy*
You can’t use The Office as a learning center
😑
Master is always the person who breaks Skarm <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Stop confusing me for everyone else birdbrain
I’m not Flubs
*takes Stuck’s flamethrower and aims it at Skarm*
Ok, I think a flamethrower will work best then
How about a Baconator with poison in it?
If I give you the whacking cane, will you end Skarm?
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I’m not Majestic
Isn’t that right Skarm?
He’s just trying to lure me in to kill me
*wonders if Skarm is referring to Gummy*
Gummy drinks coffee
It’s Master. He was adding an Eyan quote
🤢
I don’t want your hand Skarm
*four hours later*
*noms musket*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Why does Skarm keep doing that?
So, Skarm is a racist because of Gummy? 🤔
Ha
We get a lot of use out of the treason emote
*shames the British*
Good, he can’t shoot me from there
When Skarm stops killing me
Technically, it was your chemistry assignment that made the bot die, Gummy
*makes Skarm do the chemistry assignment*
So mundane, no one wants to talk about it <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
About as mundane as I can make it
So, how about that weather?
~~So, if you want to have sex with the Himalayas, then that makes you Himalaysexual~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Now I have something to ask him~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
So, Flubs did it?
*looks at Skarm for that*
Why do I feel like someone has had sex with Mount Everest at some point...
No you aren’t, ninny
Why would you want to have sex with Skarm?
I’m pretty sure that could kill you; not sleeping for that long of a time
*throws something at Skarm’s hand*
No
Well, I already die enough here thanks to Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
Because without sleep, you will die
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I sleep and I’m always tired. And I don’t like crying
And I haven’t done anything today
I don’t get it. I get enough sleep, yet half of the time, I feel like I need a nap to keep going
On a side note: I don’t know how to do photo editing 😛
Premiere and a little bit of Photoshop
I last used a Mac in senior year for video editing
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Ok, are 2 ads playing before YouTube videos for anyone else?
Wait, what are you guys talking about? <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
24? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Pepperoni, Flubs? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*Master gained 1 exp*
When?
*gives Flubs the murder cane*
I strongly disapprove of nomming dogs
No poking doggos
Happy to see the doggos then?
I see nothing wrong with what RC did <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I mean, I do think I have bronchitis, which I’m getting over now.
I just remembered something. Yesterday at work, one customer said I didn’t look happy to be there. I said I was congested. Then he replied with “Don’t get pneumonia and die”
He just keeps on swearing
But seeing it even more
It would be hilarious, Skarm rebelling against his creator
I didn’t say anything birdbrain
It’s always violent towards me
*picks the mic up and drops it*
*noms work*
It’s on
*throws door back at Skarm*
*makes Skarm finish that*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
The bot uses his new powers to poke Gummy with them
*throws Gummy’s mod powers at Skarm*
Not an excuse RC
Welcome back to the madness
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*kicks Gummy before Dragonite can*
Found it. Put the clip in <#311411150611021824>
I’ve only seen one raid happen myself. Let me find a clip
*makes Skarm ban Gummy before anyone else can for no reason*
What if you don’t get banned? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Is that even possible?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Are you trying to kill me?
I don’t want to be that young
I was only 1 then
I don’t want to go back to then. I was still in college classes I didn’t want to be in
*throws cough drops at Skarm*
I just took medicine
Ok, I just had a point where I could barely stop coughing for a couple minutes...
I think this is more for Geography
That works too
*makes Skarm fix the internet connection*
Yes Drago
Avoiding the question as usual
What is this item Skarm?
That a water gun?
😏
That works too
*throws Skarm at Gummy to get him to stop running*
So, anyone have a better day than me?
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m tired as usual
*rolls in*
If only I could...
Then I’ll freeze
Clothes shopping is boring
Actually, I’m not coughing that much so far, so that’s an improvement
I wake up and I feel only slightly better than when I went to sleep
*hopes Skarm doesn’t murder me in my sleep*
🎉
But the bot is amping the lewd up
Well, I don’t get it
Is it pony related?
~~Still not as good as “no”~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
No. The best last word
*looks at Skarm for some*
Ok, I’m going to sleep now. Any last words?
Also, the bot blew up the fake, stolen garlic bread
*bans Skarm for trying to turn the server 18+*
It’s important that Majestic likes this 😛
*makes a hole in the wall* Is that big enough? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🚪
🤔
Why would Dragonite fuck his code, Master? <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
That means you need to play it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s the song that never ends 🎵
Well, I’m getting bored but I don’t want to fall asleep yet
I’m back from work and I just feel exhausted...
Not enough
Well, I need to get ready for work. Brb
I like <:RedditSilver:383343161356976128>
Or how about Eyan in the <:SeemsGood:327307864463114250> pose
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
~~Secretly, Skarm is telling Eyan everything that goes down here~~
It’s because of his magic
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I didn’t want that
😐
*pokes Dragonite with Skarm*
So walk faster <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Say what? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Wait, what happened?
I have no idea what PC that is, being the console peasant
I thought it was 24...
The meaning of life? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
🎉
I just can’t get behind a lot of the changes to YouTube over the years
It looks like the bot is saying no one likes Eyan 😛
I agree with Master
~~Set it on fire~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Good to know Flubs
Just existing in the Kingdom of Zeal is treason
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Why don’t you tell us Skarm?
What does the bot know about Dragonite that we don’t know? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*takes the cookies Skarm has stolen and gives them to RC*
*got away safely*
Oh look. A wild Eyan has appeared
Even though it was supposed to be one of their less busy times of the year (October) it was still really busy
Last time I was on a plane was in 2010, when my parents and I went to Disney in Orlando
Getting through security takes more time than it should
I don’t like airports that much
Yes
It’s the worst in the morning
I wake up and I instantly start coughing hard 😑
Oh god, I really can’t laugh without coughing <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Don’t ask Flubs
Raw fish?
One thing I’m hating right now: every time I laugh, even if it’s just a small one, I start coughing
I want garlic bread
Mee6 pm’d me level up messages up to level 15, skipped 16 and 17, did 18, then the rest were public
No, I was referring to Monopoly <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
Isn’t life just a game, like that board game? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What am I supposed to realize now?
*changes Skarm’s name to shaved gorilla*
New quote; same old Skarm, wanting me dead
Eyan is really giving Skarm a lot of new things to say tonight <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:KingofSleeper:416763310915059712>

<@!162952008712716288> Maybe the frame at 17 seconds?
So, Skarm can steal cookies in a url?
New people who shoot you
😏
*bonks Skarm because he is not god*
So, Skarm is getting a lot of good quotes tonight <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, I can’t watch right now
Ok, so the medicine I took earlier has worn off and I’m coughing a lot again. I took some more, but it hasn’t kicked in yet
Cranes help you pick up stuff <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Of course Eyan will stream when I’m not home <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
*noms them*
I like tater tots
It’s usually because my nose is stuffy
No, I just wake up once at some random time in the middle of the night for a couple minutes
That is, if I can actually stay asleep
Ok, I have been having trouble sleeping since I have this cough, plus a stuffy nose that’s at its worst during the night, so I’ll probably have to sleep some more soon
Will that make you explode faster?
Poking Flubs will not stop you from exploding. It will probably make you explode even faster.
*takes back the 4999 and throws it at Skarm*
Oh
*gives shade a Poltergust 4999* I didn’t have the 5000 model
*throws several vacuums at shade*
I think they’ll need more than one vacuum
*arrests Flubs*
😏

I still don’t get r/jokes
Can we make a mod that puts chickens everywhere?

There’s a Minecraft reference in Skyrim?

Wait, it is, maybe

Don’t ask
I don’t know what I’m talking about <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

For a second, I thought Gummy was saying Jake Paul visited him
Something really clickbaity
I will when I’m here alone and I want Wendy’s RC. But what should I title the video?
No Animal Man. And that’s the April Fools video RC
I need to make a video for tha yewtewbs but I don’t have a clue on what to do
Just being bored
$2.80 per gallon; around that
Oh hai Kugal
I think I’ll play Odyssey tomorrow
😏
*Doesn’t get why Skarm would be uploading*
I see Skarm tried to beat me 10 minutes ago
Hello
I’m actually watching a Panera commercial and it had soup
*rips tape off which rips off my face*
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS EXPENSIVE SOUP?!
THATS TOO MUCH FOR SOUP
SO THROW IT OUT
1) I hate pulp
2) Florida’s Natural is bad orange juice. I prefer Tropicana
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
But with no pulp
I like orange juice
I said nom, not blow up Baka...
*makes Skarm nom the other parts of the thumbnail*
Wow
The think leveled you up 👌
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Not getting an emote made Skarm a racist
Why am I always getting shot?
I just have a hard time getting into action movies
It’s not bad
I’m still not a big action movie fan. For example, I found Wonder Woman to be just ok
No, it’s the pink panther’s cousin <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s an action movie
🤔🤔🤔
I think that message was from me talking about a downvote on thinking
<@335818633030795264> Why is Gummy making me ask you this? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Are you that bad at that mini game?
You’re 8 months late
You have no right to say fineeeee Skarm
He agrees; he’s aware of his stupidity
There aren’t enough fish in the world to slap Skarm with
We’re not talking about that either
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Good job RC
*dodges and watches the bullet hit Skarm*
Of course Skarm believes in RC; he wants to be lewd with you
What is that supposed to do?
*slaps Skarm with a fish for being nonsensical*
Also, Skarm is saying Bella is the new Flubs
He does
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
*Do something interesting Skarm*
Well, I’ve ran out of things I want to do. Now I’m bored
Lol
*makes Skarm nom Gummy*
*noms rude*
Not when you hate pineapple
Also, why has pineapple on pizza become such a hot topic to debate? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
He is committing <:Treason:396483914803445761>
Anyways, Gummy. Most people at conventions who cosplay as female characters are already guys. Lol
Meh
Salads are not breakfast
One that I shouldn’t physically be able to eat, but I end up eating it all
I want a plate size pancake
Now I want some breakfast food...
“I LOVE ASSHOLE” - Flubs
Some people are just assholes
You mean the thing in food?
I was in Chuggaaconroy’s fan server for an hour, but that one was WAY too busy for me
Or that I’m aware of
There aren’t enough servers that I would be interested in
I’m in 4 servers. This one, one that’s dead, one that’s really active and I only chat in on occasions, and the Patron only server
But, what about the thing? Is the thing going smoothly?
Or, how about that one thing? You know, the thing going on with the thing.
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Next year, I’ll be able to drink, but I probably won’t do it
You illegally drink already
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QrM39m22jH4
I think I remember that mission in Skyrim
“I don’t live in a fucking plane” - Flubs
~~I thought you did~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m not exploding
*asks Skarm for ideas*
Well, that works for you two
I don’t know how
Ok, not having to go anywhere is nice, until you get really bored and it’s still snowing.
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832> Head ~~Butter~~ Butler Jello
Don’t steal Bella’s catchphrase, birdbrain
*puts RC’s door back before he finds out and hits me with it*
🚪
A table with mod support <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
The table has mod support?
Sure you can. You don’t need your legs
You can climb down it
*gives Flubs a ladder*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*slaps Skarm with a stick of pepperoni*
Pepperoni muffins...
Or blueberry
I prefer chocolate chip muffins
Wow, Skarm really doesn’t want his money
*takes money*
Whatever. I’ll take his money <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That’s the 2nd time the bot mentioned paying me today
Sometimes, Skarm has really good responses
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
I’m not THAT sick. I’ve just been coughing a lot
You know you’ve been coughing too much when it hurts when you sneeze
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Again?
So, cold water effects you? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
The water isn’t that hot
Get back here and eat the bed ashes
*has Skarm nom the ashes*
🤔
At least I don’t have to leave the house, unlike the last time we got a lot of snow
We’re supposed to get 3-5 inches, while places around us are getting 1-3, so we got the worst of it
Yeesh
With how it’s snowing, you couldn’t tell it was almost 70 degrees yesterday
Probably the originals
My least favorite is between Gates to Infinity and the originals
Best Mystery Dungeon game
I have no interest in Kingdom Hearts. The series never really interested me. 
I think messages like this upset people and made them uncomfortable enough to complain to a moderator
I only found out because a moderator told me about it and how a couple people were complaining this to him
People were getting upset with me saying negative things, to put it simply
I know I said this yesterday, but I feel like saying this again. A couple people were getting upset with me in another server for, when in the middle of a conversation, when talking about a game I didn’t really care for, I would say a little bit about that
I played TF2 and OW. TF2 kind of bored me and I’ve already said my piece on OW
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k6I7SUmYlxM
And I still have memories of blowing up OW when I got mad at it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I can’t go one day without some kind of meat
We do not mention that game here
I’m not a steak person
😨
Even ham? <:Treason:396483914803445761>
*It’s treason then*
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Anyways, I still feel kind of sick. The past 2 days, I’ve just been coughing a lot. This morning, I’m still coughing, but it feels like I’m more congested
I prefer my bacon crispy
Depends on what you like
*gives Aqua a Baconator*
What?
*slaps Skarm with his pizza for always avoiding questions*
Did someone have pizza lying around?
*makes Skarm answer Master*
Give me my money now birdbrain
I’ll just blame Skarm
I wonder why many people join then leave 5 seconds later
*cough* Something like Gale of Darkness *cough*
I really wish Pokémon could do something different, instead of just using 1 or 2 gimmicks to differentiate generations.

Hang on. I need to find video of Gordon Ramsay eating pineapple pizza

I love being helpful <:Keepo:327304799919800321>

As long as you don’t have any sanity left, you can stay here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Sure
I lost it months ago
I see the usual madness has been going on in the Kingdom of Losing Sanity
*noms nomming*
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
It definitely feels like a lot of the people there don’t like any type of negativity
Anyways, being told that makes me a little nervous to chat there, at least right now
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832> Dan
Well, apparently, I’ve made a couple people upset in another server for having not-positive opinions on things
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from lunch
~~Someone take a picture of Eyan while he sleeps~~
Nah
*throws the tail into the fire*
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
*makes Skarm actually care*
He doesn’t care
That clip is irrelevant
Good, Skarm is done nomming me
*noms physics*
*noms lamb*
No, you ninny
Good luck Kugal
~~Shouldn’t hospitals serve healthy food?~~
I hate burritos
I still don’t have food...
*makes Skarm help Majestic*
That’s in 10 minutes here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws door at Skarm*
There
*throws Skarm at exam*
It’s annoying
Ok, coughing a lot has made it a little hard to have drinks
😏
I can talk about the food kind; one diner has pancakes the size of big plates
It makes me too hungry
Not what I want to see, waiting for food
I like food
Baconators
Waffles
And most of today
Try coughing all day yesterday
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Ok, I’m getting lunch now
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>

~~Just don’t fall down stairs like one person~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

You did want it to die...
It’s almost there
Right as Eyan leaves, Stephen leaves a message on his Discord 😛

*misses and implodes Skarm*
So, your name is “Me Making Fun of Myself?” <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
At least SquidofBaconator isn’t a generic name <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m not <:PCMR:305892755014418435>
I’m still on the fence with Steam
Maybe I’ll use it; maybe I won’t
It’s awful in trying it in one go
Good place to grind for levels
One of the best themes
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WuhqoZvyntA
Oh hey, you can see my toe in that picture 😛
I have both Colosseum and Gale of Darkness
GameCube
For a little while, starting in 2007, I had to secretly watch YouTube, because my parents didn’t like me watching stuff on it
I spent most of my time on the internet on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon’s websites
I loved that space pinball game
Steam started public beta testing in January 2003
~~I would’ve never guessed~~
Sure it is
I’m in the basement, so it’s always cold enough
I have a blanket right now
🤔
That’s great, since I never saw it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
*screams*
I did once when I was really young, but I was hallucinating when I did it then
I can’t stay up for 24 hours
🎉
~~I see that guy is a man of culture~~
😏
🤔
And Skarm is coming in when he’s not necessary again 😛
🎻
No
I only know two people on my friends lists on Xbox and Switch. One is a friend irl. The other is a YouTuber I watched for years
I have no idea who any of these people are <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
“Today is a cold 60 degrees” Stephen Georg
57 now. It will get cold fast later tonight; when I’m done working
I’m not sure if I’m sick or not, since I’m just coughing
Also today, I am still coughing a lot.
Today, it’s going to be 65 degrees. Tomorrow, 3-5 inches of snow
I used it before I had money
I haven’t used Steam since 2015 or something like that
😐
*drowns*
IT BURNS
Steam? Don’t you just boil water? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why does Skarm keep doing that?
We already decided that birdbrain
I see Skarm is being weird again
The Zeal timeline is very confusing <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Oh hai Eyan
He said yes

That’s how the fan base is
*makes Skarm do something entertaining*
And I have been coughing all day...
I return with cake
Hello my name is Squid and I’m tired
Hello my name is Squid and I like Baconators
*throws my fish at Skarm and runs back to work*
Ok, break’s over
*hits the bot with a fish*
*takes away Skarm’s gun*
*runs away*
*Hey Skarm, do something interesting*
Ok, break time is boring
How about you play it in his place? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*gives Ida a throwing musket*
I wonder what Skarm has to say about that
Is he telling Ida to shoot me?
*tries to tackle annoying people, but misses and hits Skarm instead*
How?
🤔
Break time
And I got a cough going, so I’ll probably have to deal with that...
At least I only have to work 3 days this week, unlike 5 days last week
I won’t be here long; I got an 8 hour shift today
Morning
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
*sees new pin*
Ok, now I’m leaving
That does nothing
*slaps Skarm with a fish for yelling*
PINK
And with that, I’m going to sleep
Shit
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
I didn’t sign up for this
What?
*switches places with Gummy*
I said nom, not arrest
*makes Skarm nom RC for that remark*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Stop avoiding the question birdbrain
Skarm just thinks it’s hilarious
Meh
I just don’t like the title “fashion warlord”
I might d- 💀
And suddenly a thousand chickens are trying to kill me
*noms chicken*
I don’t think I ever edited my Twitter profile since I first made it
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
How dare someone try to ban the nekos
It’s because he’s just *screwing* with us <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
SuperDragonite on Twitch, I think
I’m listening to heavy metal music
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Is how many episodes the anime is getting known?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
It’s true
Lol
（。_°☆＼(- – ) Then ignore us ~~Master~~ Skarm <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’d give 4 a 8.5/10 and 5 a 9.5/10. They are both great. The anime cliches were the biggest thing holding 4 back for me.
I found 3 to be kind of boring
I have seen Let’s Plays of 3, 4, and 5. I didn’t really like 3, I really liked 4, except for a few parts that boil down to anime cliches, and 5 is the best.
Ok, Skarm doesn’t need context
I know; I was talking about Persona
Moving to a new town?
（。_°☆＼(- – ) This should help Skarm’s amnesia then
The bot isn’t even sure if he has a major
When did Skarm last ask a question?
（。_°☆＼(- – )
And I don’t want to kill my kidneys Skarm
I’m not old enough to drink
What smirk? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I didn’t do anything
What?
Figure out what?
I see you guys are having fun with Skarm
I think the radiation messed with Skarm’s brain
Was Skarm eating the nukes? <:WutFace:327309186432237569>
*sends nukes away from Skarm*
I don’t speak in cursive
Etc etc etc
*slaps Skarm for only nomming me*
I knew he would nom me
*noms something*
Seriously, this is just hilarious
But we can’t ignore the classic https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sShMA85pv8M
I love how he just starts writing on the wall <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I love this one
Lol

I don’t think Ida wants to do anything with you, birdbrain
I don’t know how it got here
Because I moved it away from my home
🔫
*throws bomb at Skarm for trying to kill me earlier*
Which means I can’t nom this bomb I have.
Perfect for nomming things I really shouldn’t be nomming
I got a surgery that allowed my stomach and esophagus to not get cut up from sharp things
*noms bayonets*
*looks at Flubs*
STOP GIVING ME DEODORANT
*uses the detonator and watches the fireworks at Skarm*
*waits for Skarm to explode*
I agree with that
After that, I’d label you as more of a crazy person
If you don’t eat it, I will <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms snack*
Points?
I love these days
I did almost nothing today
I’m fine
Moral of the story: Hello Kugal
Moral of the story: most people are either stupid, assholes, or both
*starts playing why can’t we be friends*
I’ll just leave it at that
I don’t talk about that stuff because I don’t care what people do
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Gummy isn’t a lady
Gummy, stop being a bad influence on Skarm
We don’t want to know how you comfort yourself, Skarm...
No
I’m not a riven, birdbrain
You’re supposed to throw a pillow, not shoot Flubs
*And Skarm gets hit somehow, even though I wasn’t aiming for him*
*throws a pillow at no one*
🚽
I’m sure he’s wanting to do this to it right now
（。_°☆＼(- – )
That’s something I don’t think I would ever hear <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

I don’t get it; it’s just marinated chicken cut up and served on a kebab or on a sub roll
And speaking of chicken, I found out recently that chicken spiedies are just a New York State thing. I never knew this
Now I want a Chick Fil A to come here
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
Does Chick Fil A even have a restaurant in Nevada?
*gives Majestic regular fries*
Sparks? Sounds electric <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

How about that weather?!
So...
It’s quiet
You want to play it, yet you don’t want to?
Ok, now I feel like playing Cards Against Humanity. Hopefully, the site works on mobile
*blows the explosives up under Skarm*
*makes Skarm not say it*
We don’t want to hear it
I’m not going to sleep Skarm
Would screwing Skarm be in Zeal Simulator
YAY
Gummy’s love for the military has corrupted Skarm even further
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Is he referring to me or RC?
Meh
No, I want to actually keep my clothes intact
Oh joy, I love having to put away laundry... *sarcasm*
🤔
I do enjoy Pawn Stars
*steals the lunch money* I could use this
We all know Skarm is a ninny
If Skarm stops murdering me, I’ll be nice to him
🍥
It’s not a cake
*slaps Skarm with a fish to show how much we don’t care*
Exactly
I don’t think Skarm could even get a harem
I hear the bullskitty alarm
*questions why Skarm would want me on his team*
Oh boo hoo.
I don’t want to be on Skarm’s team
Wait, what?
Because Bob Ross said to
😐
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>

He’s been doing it for 5 years? <:WutFace:327309186432237569>
It feels like Skarm also loves giving everyone an identity crisis
I do wish he could just chat here once in a while, but I guess he’s too busy
He realizes his mistake
*sends Gummy to the dungeon with Skarm*
No, princesses are all the female characters in Disney films <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Same Demon Lord
Everyone else has wrecked
So, I’m watching the Daytona 500 and out of the 40 starting cars, only 7 are left for the last couple of laps
I said me, you ninny
So, Skarm likes to mention me, Gummy, Flubs, And Ida the most
Also Gummy
Don’t give it to Ida
Do you want it Skarm? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It has poison that kills everyone except me
Brb. Sandwich time
Are they up there?
😏
Of course Skarm gives you something nice. Then he’ll use that as a way to be lewd to you
Even he doesn’t know
Huh. I didn’t know glaring at Skarm was his weakness

Why is Skarm getting Gummy to help him give me more code?
More of what Skarm?
*throws Skarm at Dragonite’s code*
*noms tee hee*
Tee hee?
What group? Some of us or people in another server?
Me and a couple others are talking with Stephen (Georg) about popcorn. That’s something I never thought I would say
lol
*noms a shot of adrenaline*
I’m always tired
I can see it coming off that way
I don’t get how I can get more than enough sleep, yet I still feel tired not even halfway through the day

I actually got a lot of sleep last night
Sleeping
We should quarantine Skarm from us
That quote was mine, I think
The quote was from me
*dodges explosive jello and watches it hit Flubs*
Also, since when did Skarm get a channel?
RC is Jello now

Why does it feel like I have to break the silence here a good chunk of the time?
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Ok, I’m really going now
It’s going to snow when I leave
Meh. I’m heading to work now. 👋
Although, I’ve mostly been playing BoTW and Paper Mario as of late
But, we recently moved my Wii U to my bedroom, so I’m hoping to change that
I don’t play it that often
I haven’t even made it to Colony 6 yet 😛
Oh. I don’t think I got that far yet
Hero what now?
Jake Paul’s “ crew”
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
No
Hey Skarm, go do that. I’m *so confident* in your ability to do it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Avoiding the question, as always
Hey Skarm, do you hate the 4th wall?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
He really likes hating on walls
Isn’t Skarm always scatterbrained?
I didn’t curse
*throws a pie at Skarm*
This reminds me of a song, but I’m not sure if I can link it; not very appropriate
Flubs, how could you? <:Treason:396483914803445761>

No
*throws deodorant at Flubs*
I DON’T SMELL
*Questions why Skarm had sleeping pills*
We can make that happen if you want
Telling Dragonite to be nice is like telling Skarm to not murder. It just won’t happen.
That’s brought up a lot
But I thought you liked violence, Skarm
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
That’s 2 bans
Gummy, it’s still related to MLP
*makes Gummy further his “friendship” with Flubs instead of doing pony stuff*

*makes Gummy play Skyrim instead*
I wish I could get more sleep sometimes

*noms nothing*
Anyways, I’ve been having a lot of trouble getting to sleep. Tonight, it was like I had ringing/vibrations in my ears, which prevented me from falling asleep. It was weird and annoying
That thumbnail looks almost exactly like Eyan’s. Then again, I have seen a lot of PokeTubers who use the exact same format for both their thumbnails and their videos
We have Amazon Prime, but I never use it. My parents do
I’m sure this is also why a lot of people have stopped using cable and just have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or just view things illegally
Or you could compare it to gerrymandering
It makes regional monopolies
They do this on purpose; having only one provider in most parts of the country
And I now don’t have a lot of channels that we used to now
In exchange for having a box at every tv, we stopped paying for HBO and our home phones
And you pay a couple hundred dollars a month for this shit
They now require you to have a cable box at every tv now. And their phone line is shit
Same with Spectrum
I don’t think I’ll go back to the stream
I’ll be there in a few
Oh right. Eyan’s streaming
Here’s one of my favorites https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6mApLIV3lDM
Anyways, I’m loving these animations https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rtOzLFkWVlQ
I think Flubs had liquid explosives mixed in it
*explodes*
I’m not goi- *freezes before I can finish my sent*
*sips tea*
“Out of this world” is a play on words. I feel like that bad joke was too intelligent for this audience 🍵
Cosmic? As in, outer space?
Also, I’m surprised no one 🚪 my bad joke 😛
Do you not know the Little Debbie brand of food?
Guys, I think I’m addicted to Cosmic Brownies. They are out of this world <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Waluigi really needs his own spinoff game. Even if it was just a parody game

They did say Emile was salty in the stream

<:LUL:305559915714576385>

I have no idea what any of this is <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
What?
*plays FF victory music*
🎉
I WIN
I made the bot implode
*throws something at Skarm*
*throws paper at Skarm* I didn’t want to pass your class anyways
Even more irrelevant information Skarm...
You make everything lewd
Is Skarm going to cause us to have more people go through an identity crisis?
Animal Man isn’t here
Now it feels like the bot is being sarcastic
Yes you did, birdbrain
You can’t be a mom Skarm.
~~Flubs?~~ <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Anyways, I wonder why Skarm would say that 🤔
If a customer asks me for money, I will decline 99.9% of the time
I just parked my car and he walked up to it. I locked my door and rolled the window down slightly. “You got a dollar?” I replied “no”.
Oh, I remember that quote. I also remember when that happened
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Yeah, I still have no school. I haven’t mentioned that before, right?~~

“Have a Bad Day Day” so do they WANT kids to get angry and beat the shit out of each other?
Yeah, like that Annoy Squidward Day. Who invented that? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I looked it up to see if it’s an actual thing. It’s not, but National Ceiling Fan Day is September 18th

Why are you so set on using pony songs?
Red Bull always has weird commercials...
See?
Or did you
Yeah. You say that a lot <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And I’m getting bored. Might go to sleep soon. Idk
#Hashtag
There’s a lot of Flubs quotes in the pins now
NEIN
I knew you would suggest that one
But you don’t have a tail <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~There are none~~
You didn’t have to do that
And now I’m alone in VC again
It’s 49 here
I hated snow when I started driving
I just don’t like snow anymore
Well, I just saw something I really never expected or wanted to see...
This definitely does feel like Skarm is being rewarded for being a dumbass
*kills Flubs with spreadsheets*
I think Skarm just started hating me randomly one day
Why do your legs keep imploding?
Spell check doesn’t help me. It murders me
The 5 Variations of Flubs should be in a sitcom
NOT FIBUS
*Questions why Dragonite is looking at Skarm* 🤔
I have only known you guys for less than a year
Next thing you know, Ayana will join the revolution
Dragonite wants to usurp Eyan’s position
No
Ok <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

🎉
Should Skarm be allowed to use memes? <:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Bad spelling
This isn’t a meme
So, did Skarm take your money and give it to someone else?
Why does Skarm keep trying to kill me...
YOU DAMN BOT
*questions why Skarm would be allowed to be violent*
I love how when I do something to Skarm, he does something violent to someone else
*cuts Gummy’s hair*
*slaps Skarm with a fish for not converting*
Just tell us something Skarm
If there isn’t, I will be very disappointed
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
300 dollars for that? Lol
My ass doesn’t need to be on fire, thank you very much 😑
Hey
😏
*arrests Gummy for illegal gambling*
I’m probably the only one currently here who will know what Gummy is talking about
I played a couple days ago, I think
Again
I got cookie cake now.
It’s where you make your own MARIO levels
Mario Maker
I don’t remember that
I remember seeing the reactions to the FF7 remake. Everyone lost their shit
The Final Fantasy 7 remake will come out when Half Life 3 comes out <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
From what I played of it, FF15 is good
Also, I hated the soccer mini game in 10
This one Gummy https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yVG9tTl_IHU
I played Final Fantasy 7, 10, And 15. 7 for only a half hour because I hated it. 10 for several hours but O still didn’t like it. 15 is the one I actually liked
I know the one Gummy is talking about
There’s one fan game where there are gym leaders for every type and they all have 6 Pokémon
Nice pin
They are a sandwich at Wendy’s
Yes
My April Fools video will just be me eating a Baconator
I just want potatoes now
*noms potatoes*
I also don’t care about nuzlocke runs or anything like that
I don’t use randomizers
I never caught a legendary in a poke ball
Gen 5 And 1 are my least favorite
The sequels are much better
I think B/W is mediocre
That’s a whole other discussion
I prefer Emerald and HeartGold
I disagree
If Platinum didn’t exist, I would dislike Gen 4 a lot more
They were better in Platinum
It’s not just Lance; a lot of gym leaders had weird teams. Like Morty. In his entire gym, the only Pokémon there were Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar. Where’s Misdreavus?
Yeah
Then why didn’t he use Kingdra?
I don’t get why they didn’t make at least 1 more dragon Pokémon for Gen 2 so Lance didn’t have to use 3 Dragonite
~~You’re gay~~

Fuck you too

I think Skarm needed something thrown at him
Good
*throws a clarinet at something*

<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
So, as I said earlier, today is Annoy Squidward Day
“Prick”
Hmm?
The weather was really nice today
I didn’t. Although I was feeling slightly more upbeat today
I feel tired because this was my 4th day in a row working
I feel really tired.
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Bye
*noms pokes*
Well, break is over. Back to being annoyed Day <:Keepo:327304799919800321>

Someone in another server pointed this out and said “Looking at you Squid”
Guys, today is Annoy Squidward Day
Not very good, but still
I’m on break and I did have food
I have cookie cake now
*noms muffin*
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Did Ida help?
What did Skarm do to me?
Gummy, McDonalds is <:Treason:396483914803445761>
Can I have some?
Dragonite is Will now?
*throws a Baconator at Skarm* Stop calling me different names
And now he’s starting to rebel
I don’t think Skarm wants to play
Make Skarm say your mom jokes?
What were you trying to do?
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
So Skarm, will you mention me more?
Don’t you get the meme?
SOMEBODY TOUCH MAH SPAGHET
~~Promote my videos instead~~
OH MY HOW LEWD
<@!137336478291329024> How does it feel to have your bot self promoting your videos? 😛
The bot is breaking the 4th wall again
*slaps Skarm with another fish* Stop nomming me
😡
*noms hashbrowns*
I see Skarm is avoiding answering
*slaps Skarm with a fish* He wants this?
Why must my name come up more?
What class does Skarm take? “How to kill and steal”?
I feel too tired to dignify Skarm’s stupidity with a response
RC, did you do it yourself?
Is RC now Gummy, according to Skarm?
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Nice to meet you, overused joke

There’s too much going on 😛
I just checked and I think it’s getting close to 20 more
I did gain 15 pounds since the end of high school. Exactly Bella
Just give me a salad, but with only bacon and croutons (and take away everything else) and I’m set
I love bacon
Whenever we go to Olive Garden, when they bring out salad and breadsticks, I eat a breadstick and some croutons
Croutons are great
I don’t like salad
I have only talked to one YouTuber I watch
It’s the closest I will come to actually talking to them
Him and Mal (his wife) do show up in the Discord server quite a bit; at least one of them, once a day
I think that was from when we were talking about how I became a Patron
Now he’s naming random people
I’m pretty sure Skarm is always broken
Yeah, Flubs has nothing to do with this
*throws the rest of it at Skarm*
It tastes like a phone
*noms phone steak*
Phones don’t give people steak
You heard Majestic Skarm
There’s steak defrosting here
I don’t think nomming can help this situation
Well, that sucks
I’ll be fine, until I have to go to work for 7 hours
I have a long closing shift tonight so I don’t have much of a night life tonight 😛
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
I don’t really care what people do

Who?
*slaps Skarm with a fish* Stop making everyone violent towards me
No it’s not
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
*kill me* If I did, then I would be dead too
Yeah. It’s just me and the thoughts
Bleh to you too
Even better
<:doit:334014889137930240>
Can’t you just stick with Gummy?
*watches as it starts raining*
You should get that fixed
Gummy, when anyone says they are leaving, no matter who, we stop talking
Anyways...
If we let Flubs bring his explosives, something bad will happen
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Gummy, something bad always happens
I hear the bullskitty alarm from Gummy saying he doesn’t steal ideas

I’m doing nothing and being bored while doing it

Ok, break is over. Back to work...
RC doesn’t have an empire
Not 😏
Ok, I don’t know how I managed to eat my large lunch, but I did
RC can win?
I made the bot leave. I win
*squirts not water at Skarm*
No, it’s a water gun
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
🔫 Bring it on Skarm
I don’t think Skarm will ever think Gummy is the best
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Yeah, <:WutFace:327309186432237569>
Hey Skarm, can you say anything positive about Gummy?
Gummy, you are a Baka. Is that how it works? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

What are you guys doing?
There’s a lot of fish in the sea
*slaps RC with an explosive fish*
So, what exactly are you trying to do?
Welp
Take a shot every time the bot says “We back”
Another thing
Whatever else too
The fuck
Shit
Honestly, Lazytown isn’t that bad
Slap you with more fish tomorrow? Got it
In my case, Skarm just wants to murder me
I think Skarm is tired of responding to Dragonite
That doesn’t have anything to do with Gummy beating you Skarm
That’s what I was trying to do
@ Wolverale Start spamming <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

I really hate trying to save my project in Premiere, but I end up closing it instead, which means I have to exit out and do stuff over again...
I love days when I don't have to do anything, especially when I have to work 4 days in a row, starting tomorrow
Now it’s not 100% greetings <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
So how about that weather?!
👋
I believe the next GTA Online episode is being recorded
Random thought: one thing interesting about being in Stephen Georg’s Patreon Discord is that you can tell when they’re recording a Stephen&Friends episode
-In the case that you do this, you will be banned <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That’s not working
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
I just like doing it when I get really bored
*noms hashbrowns*
Quick Skarm. Do something
Well, it seems like a quiet night here
Well, I have to work 5 days next week
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*rolls away*
I’m back for 5 seconds
*Ok, bye Squid* Bye thoughts
Ok, I must get ready for a closing shift tonight. Bye
Food Fime
Most of the time we have pork chops, they end up chewy, bland, and they dry out halfway through eating them
Pork loin

What’s sala?
I only like pork chops if they are grilled or if they have shake n bake on them
I hate pork chops
Pork is good, well some of it
Sausage and/or bacon is a requirement
NEIN
I hate mushrooms
*DAB*
*throws all the pineapples in the world into a void*
Pineapple on pizza
*gets a Digorno pizza*
I call this piece: “Bold and Brash”
*throws pizza at the wall* Like that? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s been more than 15 seconds since he last said something
Uhh, you there Skarm?
😐
And I see Skarm was being his usual self
Oh, looks like I missed Andi and his once every 3 months Discord visit 😛
That's happened to me before, but not in the subscription feed
~~So go back to Gummy~~
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
It didn't take a lot for you to hate me Skarm
Uhh, Skarm. We don't want Gummy flirting
That's because the PS4 has been out for a couple years and they moved on to the PS4 Pro
*Arrests Skarm for shutting off the battle station*
At least it's not a $1,000 phone or a $500 Xbox
*gives Bella a lightswitch* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*Makes Bella play 200cc on Rainbow Road*
~~200cc is the only way to play~~
Wait, Ida. Why are you running away? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*Shrug*
You forgot the "LOOK"
:l
Everyone here is weird
He did <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
So far, Skarm has 4 votes and Eyan has 2
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*changes Majestic’s name to something else*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
🎉
Did you really think Master would listen and be obedient?
NEIN
Days?
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
It’s too loud...
And I’m drinking nothing
I wonder why Skarm hates onions
*gives Gummy 100 pounds of British tea*
😏
I’m playing on the Switch right now
“Gender Switch day” 😐

Nomming me is not dinner for normal people
*slaps Skarm with a fish*
*noms rock*
I don’t play <:Treason:396483914803445761> games
Lol
Good response 😒
~~Are the cats training to fence in the Olympics?~~
At my skill level, here would be the game I make: you talk to one guy and you beat the game
I’m not skilled enough to make anything <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I did the second one. Not sure who did the first
To Gummy
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Don’t you just shrug at that
*slaps Skarm with a fish for no reason*
I don’t think Skarm will ever give an answer
*slaps my door with a fish*
Why did you censor that? Isn’t it just a salad? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
*looks at 350 hours of Fallout 4*
That’s not much
Usually mess with you. That’s how TheRunawayGuys work, right? 😛
I can’t remember the last time I sat down and read a book that wasn’t for school
I think Ida doesn’t like me now 😛
😐
Reading books is overrated
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
Coincidence? I THINK NOT
The video is #1 on trending
Random thought: I think Casey Neistat is dabbing in the thumbnail to his latest video
Great, now I want more pizza from dinner...
Or it’s called “order a pizza”
No Master
I prefer putting ice type moves on water types.
I just don’t like a lot of ice types
I don’t like the Stockpile strategy. Not my thing
I will never understand why anyone like it. Unless you are a poison type lover
It’s weird if you ask me. Not as bad as Garbodor, but still
Well, Chuggaaconroy is using a Cryogonal as his 6th Pokemon. 😐
Irl, I have no patience
~~I thought Dragonite was your favorite~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hey, that’s Skarm’s job.
*noms not fully cooked pizza* I’m tired of waiting
*sigh*
Ok, Skarm. You’re up
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Anyways, I’m getting bored waiting for dinner. Someone do something interesting
Those were the days where I question why we need to change into gym clothes
I’ve had written tests in gym class before.
⚰
I’m glad I don’t have to worry about tests. I feel so much better knowing that
You fail gym class by either not showing up or not participating at all
If that doesn’t work, we can get Skarm to cheer you up 😏
*slaps Gummy with a fish* That should get you to stop crying
Soda, milk, water, hot chocolate. Those are the beverages I drink
Tea is overrated
And that too
Just the usual shenanigans here with Skarm
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
😏😏
Good, Skarm didn’t nom me
*noms proverbs* These didn’t help
I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, but I barely remember any of it
*noms deletion* Just in case
😏
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
🤔
🤔
Gummy, just be a normal person
High school romance shit ends up horrible 99% of the time
I just stuck an explosive in a potato.
*feeds Skarm the semi explosive potatoes*
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
“Semi” explosive proof?
So, Flubs fed him explosives?
Did Flubs set you on fire? He likes to do that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~So, criticize?~~
You are trying too hard to look dumb
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
That battle doesn’t help
No
It works in most situations
He’s in denial
Well then...
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Is eating cash lewd?
Seems like Skarm wants Flubs
Ida is better than Nightshade, according to the bot
I think Skarm doesn’t want to, based off his last response Gummy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Don’t study~~
I’m already pink
Good, Skarm isn’t nomming me anymore
*noms pizza*
Pennies for Pizza?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rAlTOfl9F2w
Not that one
He’s been at the company for 20 years
So, I’m not sure how many animation fans there are here, but apparently, Butch Hartman (Fairly Oddparents creator) has left Nickelodeon.
No
I’m glad Skarm isn’t doing that to me
So Skarm just views dating Ida as an incentive for something else...
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
I’m bored. Skarm: do something interesting
~~Aren’t genes a form of clothing?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*rolls away*
Oh well
Random thought: Ever since the Super Bowl, I’ve been drinking a lot of soda
Just because you’re broken doesn’t mean you can break others
Well, Skarm is broken. Again
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Break time
You heard him Skarm
😏
He would rather whack things
I think Skarm is done taking orders from Dragonite
Ok, I’m going to bed. I got work for the 3rd day in a row tomorrow
That’s his response to getting fired
But that’s not made of cheese...
What do you mean “ouch”? You wanted to do this Skarm
Auto chests teach you about the moon?
*sends Skarm to the moon* He can find out
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
*of cheese*
*noms block*
Why are you sighing?
Quiet you
I see Skarm has no objections
Should I start a “Skarm vs Wolverale” scoreboard?
Your report missed <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😏
*slaps Skarm with a fish* Harassing people is wrong. Only people can do that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
You need to learn
*JUDGES*
You only kept asking me about commercials, Skarm 😒
I see Skarm is being weird again
🤢?
Ain’t is in the dictionary, last I checked
Mainly because I ain’t a pc gamer
I’ve never been to a LAN party
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Only in the Kingdom of things that I want to list but I’m too lazy to say them ™
Every time I see that, one of my Brain Cells die
Then you are no help Skarm
That’s the program <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What’s stopping you Skarm?
I think he wants a divorce
So, it’s Skarm then? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
So, you’re married to Flubs?
~~You can’t marry yourself to the musket you have been dating~~
Lol
If you’re calling him that, I’ll call him gumbo
Nah
I’m calling him Gum mug gum
*throws some ice in the water*
😏
🤔
I see the usual is going on
~~Ok, ignore what I said~~
I made it back home alive
I hate having to go to work when there’s a winter storm warning going on
*sigh* I hate snow
😏?
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I don’t want to know...
What use do legs have if you can’t use them?
No one here is dazzling
No Gummy
Flubs should get paid to make more art like that
The Thinkinator is new; after I became pink
🤢
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
It’s annoying to the bot that Animal Man is a guy?
*slaps Animal Man with Skarm* You can’t beat that
*slaps Animal Man with an animal*
*Slaps Animal Man back with a fish*
NEIN
~~Flubs is Flubs~~
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
No
Git gud thn Animal Man
Bipolar?
Multi Personality Disorder?
You are Gummy
It’s a terrible place
WELCOME TO THE CLUB
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>

Gummy... <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I hear the bullskitty alarm again
Sentences
Neither
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
I’ll wait until Summer for lemonade
I’m glad to see you’re happy <:Keepo:327304799919800321>

Night Dragonite
I won’t “hold on” to anything of yours Skarm
No
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
That’s my quote
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
No beep
😏
*ANGRILY BEATS SKARM WITH A FISH* THIS ISN’T ANGER
NO I DON’T
~~So be oblivious to everything Skarm~~
There’s your history
^
He will kill us with a muffin
Someone make Skarm dumber before he kills us all
Keep it that way
I’m glad Skarm is nomming people other than me
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Well, great. Now how will I make money?
But I have to go to work...
It’s going to snow a lot tomorrow
*stays inside*
I don’t think Skarm will ever give enough details or make sense in any way
Yes you do
I also see a ton of Skarm quotes going on
What’s going on? Is Flubs getting killed?
We’re getting hit by a lot of snow tomorrow
8 hour shifts just drain the energy out of me. I had 299 customers, which is a LOT more than usual. It was busy all day
I’m tired
👋
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*you got me* Shut up thoughts
Well, it’s seems like it’s just me
Break time
There was one day where we got over a foot in less than a day
:feelscoldman:
We are going to be getting 5-8 inches of snow through tomorrow
~~No one cares Skarm~~
I will only go on a diet when I have some bad health condition
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Dietry? Someone going on a diet?~~
Well, fuck
What he said
“Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells”
*noms ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)*
*noms confiscating*
*pulls out another fish* I got almost as many fish as I do Baconators
*slaps RC with a fish for deleting that comment*
I don’t like being a mage; I prefer one handed weapons
🤢
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
“Is that fur? Coming out of your ears”
Same
“This better not be all the things you can’t be bothered to carry”
“I am *sworn* to carry your burdens”
I always join Dawnguard
I always just do all the faction missions
Dark Brotherhood
I like using a sword and a healing spell
Same
~~You just choose Argonian. Always choose them~~
😐
Of course Skarm is upset; he doesn’t know the answer
Sure
Argonians are the lizard race
😒
I got 8 out of 15
*disowns Gummy*
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
（。_°☆＼(- – )
Have you even played Skyrim yet?
🤔
（。_°☆＼(- – )
Can’t do anything about that
*noms homework* No you don’t <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I have been feeling really tired a lot today. Probably because I haven’t done anything today 😛
~~Yeah, the glass is more important than me~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And we cleaned it up
My feet are fine
Bad news: I broke a drinking glass on hardwood floor with water still in it
Good news: I just had some great pie
Well, I got good news and bad news
Make your head explode? <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
🎉
~~If Ida gets an award for beating Gummy with a stick, can I get one for slapping him with a fish?~~
~~Garfield Kart?~~
Popping back to Black once in a while
Mostly White
Both
I just don’t like the game
I saw parts of it. I just can’t watch the whole thing
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Oh, they keep recommending me meme playlists
Ok YouTube. Why do you keep recommending me YouTube Red series when I have never shown any interest in them ever?
Want some popcorn? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Why did that get taken out again? Gummy request it?
I was just showing Majestic the original
-vetter
~~If you have no life and get to level 50~~
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Here’s the original Master made
When I turned to Pink Nu
Flubs would never use that emote
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Flubs isn’t around
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
*blames Dragonite*
Both towards Gummy
Violent towards me. Lewd towards you
I think Skarm just gets violent when I’m around
All I know is, Skarm said 2 messages with my name in a row
🔪 Try that again, Skarm
*slaps Skarm with a fish*
No
~~I blame Skarm. He probably stole or nommed something that made it bad~~
I love it when my internet starts turning to shit randomly
That’s all the stuff in the Emoji movie, right?
Why do I expect Skarm to give me an answer...
😐
What is morded Skarm? Also, what does that mean?
Yes
Lol
Especially when you consider how sick the country is right now
No it’s not
Now everyone is kissing the trophy 😐
Ok, I’m going to sleep in a few, now that this is over
I bet Boston will have angry fans rioting
I know Philadelphia isn’t that safe of a city, so it could get crazy
*shrug*
The last big championship the Eagles won was before the Super Bowl
The Patriots have Tom Brady
One season, they only had 4 or 5 wins
They haven’t had very many good seasons recently
Too bad <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
~~I think Skarm has had enough of our shit~~
Same
EAGLES WON THE SUPER BOWL
ITS SO TENSE
*noms weird text thing*
Yet another timeout
The clock is ticking down now
I did watch golf yesterday
Multiple plays
That too
Thank time-outs for that
American Football is a slow “stop and start” sport
Eagles have the ball after a turnover
2 minute warning
YOU GUYS DON’T KNOW HOW EXCITED I AM WATCHING THIS GAME
THEY GOT A TOUCHDOWN
The Eagles are 1 point behind and are trying to get one more touchdown right now
2 1/2 minutes left in the Super Bowl
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Damn misspelling...
“I will defeat Ganon with my mop” - No one
It definitely gets loud in handheld mode
SO SKARM IS A PATRIOTS FAN?!! *throws many fish at it*
Yes it is
29-26 at the end of the 3rd quarter
Who does Skarm not want to end up like him? Draco?
Ok, why won’t Skarm shut up?
It is and it’s great
Lol
Mess with her 3 times, she attacks you and you lose a couple hearts
I know that girl
*blames Immaturity*
~~The fight will last forever~~
Bring it on Skarm
Skarm wants to fight?
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
No underage drinking
Oh hai Bella
Holographic Prince 😐
Well, I am liking this halftime performance so far
Justin Timberlake time in just a couple minutes
Skarm has spaghetti?
I don’t bet money
Now it’s time for Justin Timberlake’s performance in a few
Halftime
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
22-12 near halftime
EAGLES TOUCHDOWN
Ida won’t do anything
*puts Gummy in jail*
Hey. I didn’t decide that
😐
🔫
Since that’s what you want, you aren’t getting it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Do you want life in prison?
*arrests Gummy for assault*
*blames a rock*
🎉
No
Cadance isn’t here
*throws a rock at Skarm* Here. Date this
Ida’s weapon will be a squirt bottle?
Your dad is supporting the right team
He wants us to fight
ANOTHER EAGLES TOUCHDOWN
*pokes Skarm in the throat*
He happy or mad?
🎉
And then the Patriots missed a field goal
Wow, the running back (Patriots) tried to jump over a defense guy but failed
💀
😏
This isn’t my exploding fish
*whacks Flubs again with a fish*
Lol, Wendy’s just did a Twitter roast against McDonald’s in their commercial
I do eat frozen food a lot
NO
I WILL NOT STAY CALM
Eagles
TOUCHDOWN
But I’m Pink. Isn’t that worthy enough?
~~Get her to make me a lasagna~~
I think there will be a Star Wars spin-off movie focusing on Han Solo
I’m watching the Super Bowl
Hey, a guy needs his guy time
I’m surprised my team made it this far
Over a hundred million people will be tuning in 😐
This is 52
Total
Yeesh, this is the 10th Super Bowl for the Patriots
“The Eagles are hungry. And not just for a cheesesteak” GET IT?! BECAUSE PHILADELPHIA!! 😑
You either are a fan of one of the teams, or you are just tired of the Patriots winning
It’s why literally every sport movie has the cliche of scoring the winning goal at the last second
I only care about the Eagles.
Yeah
Normally, I don’t care too much about the results, but this time, I really care. I’m an Eagles fan
Well, the game isn’t starting just yet, but it’s getting close
Really?
Super Bowl time 🎉
🎉
I’m sure most people are aware of the Puppy Bowl at least
Whoever smirked, HOW LEWD 😒
Wow, there’s even a Kitten Bowl on top of the Puppy Bowl
It’s snowing here
Perfect
And why am I always in Skarm’s messages when I’m around?
Oh
AWS?
Again?
Yeah
Good, Skarm didn’t nom me
*noms something*
Ok, I’m hungry and dinner won’t be ready for 10 minutes 😑
He’s blaming Deci
You have a dog?
~~I think Skarm wants to role play as a neko~~
A cat
~~Me dying?~~
DAMMIT SKARM. STOP DOING THAT.
*noms steak*
I’m having pizza and wings soon
*paints over Twitch* Did it help?
Lol
🎉
I got shrimp and pretzels now
*drinks tea*
There is a mii from someone in Mario Kart with one large eye and no mouth
Definitely a lot better than I do in most games
Last 50 battles: 33 wins and 17 losses.
Ok, 2 matches in a row where everyone on my team kept dying all at once
I haven’t really played Ranked much, so I’m still in the lower rankings
Ranked
Busy playing Splatoon

Speaking of Xenoblade, I finally got to a point where things started to pick up in Chronicles
Test
Can you explain?
Are you referring to the alternate universes with Rainbow Rocket
Yeah, I don’t want to even know how bad it is
I’m unmuted, but I have nothing to say

I liked Cars 3

So, Skarm is a yandere?
His love will be in Creative
Hey, Skarm is for Gummy
😐
Worth it
*hugs nothing*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I got over 120 hours into it
BoTW
😏
You are going to date Skarm and you will like it, Gummy
No
*ha ha*
I just saw Rainy in another server 😛
I’m fine with being blamed for that
Looks like Flubs is the 1st victim
*ignores knife and noms air*
Gummy, you’re still tied to the chair. You don’t have a choice
It sounds like it
~~pin that~~
Looks like Ida is at your date too
*has Skarm nom the muskets* Gummy, focus on your date with the bot
RC, you knew exactly what I was thinking
*drags Gummy to a restaurant and ties him to a chair* You. Date this real person.
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Go on a date with a REAL PERSON for fucks sake
And our ears are bleeding while we’re burning to death
And now we are all dead
That made it worse
Great, you started another fire
🔥
😏
2 hungry quotes
*slaps Skarm with a fish* no
The school on how to nom things
Hey Skarm, instead of nomming me, go nom the glasses
*We know*
I am pink!
Another mid life crisis from Skarm again
That’s a no from Skarm
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Potatoes make for the best weapon
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Yes you do; everyone level 50 and above does
~~But you can’t deny your pink heritage~~
A little bit of all cultures
You can’t deny your heritage
We know you’re pink deep down
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
What?
How about I call you brother, brother?
Yes
~~But now he’s calling ME brother~~
Pony song?
I just love it when my internet quits on me...
Hello pink brother
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Ok, bye
#NotTreason
Someone on another server said exactly that too 😛
Ok, I must go to a long shift at my job now
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
~~Quick Draco. Start spamming~~
Perfect
<:Thinkinator:409416852368785428>
Lol
*burns hair*
🤢
*and then the chat went silent*
Don’t call me darling and don’t call this Pink divine
I’m not doing that
NEIN
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
ONE OF US
Well, at least I turned pink before I had to go to work
Nah
You just have to not have a life like me
🎉
LETS GO BE PINK NOW
I want to be Pink now
If only the Millennium Falcon could time travel...
I can already do that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
“Bad” plot lines
But, I don’t have that power yet
I really wish I could control time
I’m not a time lord <@!162952008712716288>
I pretty much have to wait 1 minute before I can get more exp
THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG
I’M TRYING
*noms it*
I’m really close
Ok, I just want to be Pink Nu now
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
YOU DIDN’T NOM THE BACONATOR?!
*slaps Master with a Baconator*
😡
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
~~PC’s are overrated~~
Kitty
Isn’t that right Skarm?
He will when you don’t say his name as the 1st word in the sentence
This is nothing
~~I DON’T KNOW ANYMORE~~
Ok, that was pointless
WORK RIGHT
*Yells at the W*
-Two
Then what meaning would be given for the “ThinSteps?”
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
ThinKing?
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
And Master hates the yellow cancer balls
Animal Man joins in sometimes
Did Flubs downvote that? I can’t see; mobile
~~Especially Flubs~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I THINK that will be beneficial for everyone
🤔
I’m 440 away from Pink Nu. But I don’t know what to talk about to get there 😛
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
~~Get banned at level 100~~
Lol
Morning
It will be for me when I get to level 50 sometime
At least they don’t try to restrict my access to my accounts or something like that. If they did, then I would move out in a heartbeat
But if they REALLY wanted to, they could end up doing that
I believe I said this before, but the main reason they do this is because, they don’t like me spending money when I don’t help contribute through rent or some other payment
On one hand, I get it. But on the other, it feels like they don’t really understand
They just think I’m wasting my money on things I don’t need
How is a person supposed to become an adult if they can’t decide what to do with their money? And it’s not like I drain my accounts. I make sure to not go overboard
I just want them to realize that they can’t keep holding my hand/bug me over every fucking purchase I make, no matter how big or small it is
And I’m sure this could add fuel to that fire
Anyways, my parents have said before that they don’t want me to end up like my sister who ended up loaning money to a friend. And she doesn’t have much money now
~~And it’s Stephen~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yep
Which they probably will
I just hope my parents don’t bother me about giving money to someone I don’t know to play video games and vlog
After being hesitant for a few days now
Also, I just pledged to someone on Patreon for the 1st time
Good, it wasn’t stolen
Random thought: I have a cookie from KFC now. They have pretty decent cookies.
I’m guessing that would be another screech song Master? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I saw everything
😐
Ok, I’m sleeping on the couch tonight then
Ok, I’m going to sleep now
And dried out
I had potato wedges that were hard and chewy
Why is it I’m always hungry right before I go to bed...
What dance video?
I didn’t know Skarm is taking Physics
*drags Wolverale against his will*

Ok, now most of the commentary is League talk
Idk
Ok, now it’s getting almost impossible to understand what’s going on 😛

The first thing I hear when I join VC is Gummy talking about ponies 😑
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
I’m going to blame Skarm
Nah
Weren’t you going to do that 5 minutes ago?
Lol

~~I didn’t know Mudkips could be evil~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It seems like Gummy *wants* to get banned.
Don’t blame Gummy
Stop nomming me Skarm
*noms stick*
Go where?
~~Ida, how much would Gummy have to do for you to ban him?~~
By ban button, don’t you mean the banhammer? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Who is this SuperGummying fellow? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Any suggestions?

No, it was just oxy- ☠

No

*throws fish at all the clowns*
I hate clowns
I don’t think it’s that scary
So is the ceiling gullible? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Gummy, just stop.
Anyways, for the first 2 hours of my shift, one of our registers was broken, so there were only 2 cashiers, not counting the service desk. And it was EXTREMELY busy
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
Well, my day at work wasn’t that good
Good
I’m not getting Nitro
What’s with the Twilight emote?
And Ida’s pic is better
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I want it to be spring already
The snow we had melted yesterday but now, we got another batch of snow...
The power of the think will make it possible
🤔
Giggle?
We don’t giggle here. We point and laugh loudly
It’s why I don’t do anything with Twitch
I like most things in Ultra Moon more
I have my job and my YouTube channel.
Even with a job
I do
I can’t tell if you are serious or joking about that
It’s in <#311409240327585802>
7, 7, 14, 7, 30. I haven’t been doing well recently
👋
~~I’m better~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And my most viewed video has over 13,000 views
I do have a video uploaded in October that has almost 600 views
Any view is a good view
As I said earlier, I have 155 subs. But my video uploaded today only has 7 views
I’m not uploading to Twitch anytime soon, so it doesn’t bother me
🤔
Hey, I need that to breathe
*pokes nothing*
And I’ll stick to YouTube <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Meh
*types vomit*
I’m not vomiting
It’s going to get cold tomorrow
Ok, I want to say something to get closer to level up, but I don’t know what to talk about
I don’t know
Can we even classify Skarm as anything?
I’m just going to blame Skarm
I doubt Reddit would have exp- 💣
*noms reddit* It tastes terrible
~~I’m fine with blaming Gummy~~
Why do you keep asking me that Skarm?
This isn’t a commercial
I see Skarm tried to check his rank
*drags Gummy back to YouTube* Wait, do I want him here? *throws him to Dailymotion*
~~I said Zelda so I’m also right~~

Wait, Skarm has brothers?

Groundhog is a groundhog
Oh, tomorrow’s Groundhog Day

Well, when I was looking at the amount of likes I get on my videos in the analytics, I saw one day, I had 31 likes when the other days were 0-5
Never mind, my mom is using the computer...
Brb
Oh, wait. I need to show you guys something
I just assume my subscribers don’t really care
Some videos struggle to get over 10 views for days
I think over 57,000
Total channel views?
155
Some of my videos don’t get any comments
I still don’t have any active commentators...
Now, I don’t have the option to make money because I don’t have 1,000 subscribers 😑
I’m not making any money off my videos
Twitch. Stop getting drunk and overcomplicating things
“I randomly pick”

The 2nd picture, stupid
That first one doesn’t look to bad
Can’t a site just make uploading and streaming both equally easy?
🤔
I eat 3 meals and usually 2 snacks. Days that I work, the schedule is usually fucked up
That’s snack time for me
😑
And I really am hungry an hour after dinner
I’m usually hungry by 4
I eat earlier than the usual 6pm dinner
I ate at 5
I needed that after dinner snack
*noms popcorn*
Everyone here is a ninny
*ninny pokes*
I just looked up Aunt Jemima and the brand got the name from a former slave in 1889
Oh. Must be a regional thing or something
Aunt Jemima or butter syrup?
I’m not sure if I ever had anything from Aunt Jemima
Butter syrup?
Now I want pancakes...
🔥
The crazy girl thinks this person is talking to her in her head
So, the crazy girl on Dr Phil apparently fell in love with someone she never met on Twitter; the other person has never messaged her and called in for the crazy girl to be on Dr Phil
Good, because I wouldn’t pay for it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Shall we hold a funeral for Skarm?
Ok, I think Skarm hates the name now
Dammit birdbrain
I’m back from eating dinner and my parents are watching a crazy girl on the Dr Phil show

That didn’t level you up

If Gummy levels up again before I do, I’m going to be mad
Nope

Sleep

Discord, go to sleep. You're drunk
I see the crown
Did you update?
Probably why I hated playing ranked; I couldn't get above gold
😏
~~I have no friends~~
You are very lucky Draco
I maily just stayed with Reaper and Roadhog when I played
I remember I was constantly on the teams where we all died at the same time
I say this as I'm watching a video showing angry gamers freaking out 😛
And by "stopped playing it" I mean, "blew up the servers in frustration because I couldn't stop losing" <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That's Overwatch for ya. Part of the reason as to why I stopped playing it
I never really liked TMNT

He goes live right as I get into the line at the drive thru at McDonalds

Lol
*wakes up and disowns Gummy for no reason, also*
Sick burn
Let’s leave Skarm out of this. His insults are too good for Gummy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s still treason
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
~~You aren’t fooling anyone~~
The children don’t need to know yet
For science
Research
But they could get him banned. Actually, they can definitely stay
~~Even the nsfw ones?~~
I read that as “so I can poke it”
~~I thought Flubs was part of the Flubs species~~
*slaps RC with a new fish*
😐
Dragonite, It would go something like, “WE NEED SKARM TO BE NONSENSICAL FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE LITERALLY NOTHING BETTER TO DO”
Skarm hasn’t liked anyone since the 4th grade
😏
And Skarm just likes killing me
It provides entertainment when I’m really bored
~~I just blame the bot for everything~~
I wonder why Skarm loves being so lewd
A penguin knows about ww2?
🤔
The generals
The most interesting thing Skarm will do
He likes it
He’s still poking
My fish
Why not?
*slaps Skarm with a fish*
Don’t crush anything birdbrain
😏
“Stuff”
No
Music dosed with laxative
😏
*judges*
You need a 3DS and money
You can blow stuff up with Skarm’s input? How?
Does anyone ever ask for Skarm’s input?
I never looked away
I see almost everything
~~Saw that~~
I invented a time machine in 5 seconds. I could only use it once
Everyone will probably hate you for it
AAAAAAHH

Isn’t Skarm always weird?
Is melted cheese sfw?
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
He didn’t call it by the actual name
😏
I don’t think Skarm will give you a straight answer
An insult
As always, Skarm makes no sense. Just what I’d expect
You can’t read water. I didn’t know
Don’t blame thinking
Asking will make YOU confused
No
Ok

Also, Gummy died. I’m glad to see I’m not the only one who dies around here
But, I do have to work for a couple hours tonight
I have no school
And you’re 1 level away from Kilwala
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
I was just finding out about that
Night
And then, I dream something weird
And by now, I mean I’ll be tossing and turning in bed for a little while until I just randomly sleep
I’m just going to go to sleep now
If I eat, then it will be a lot harder to sleep
Ok, I really shouldn’t be hungry at 10:49 at night...
If you can’t, then you’re pretty much an insomniac
On one hand, I would love not feeling tired and you can get a lot more done if you don’t need sleep. On the other hand, there won’t be a good way to just rest
Well, I’m sure some of us here would lend a ear if you need it. But it would also be good to find someone irl to talk to
Uhh...
Frozen, how way your day?
Can Skarm stop mentioning Gummy in unrelated conversations?
Bullskitty
And Skarm is obsessed with teaming all of a sudden
Flubs isn’t here
Of course you never teamed
You aren’t helping me, Skarm
Then I would still die

Yep
RC, attempting to get away from Skarm will only draw him in closer
Although, a chocolate chip muffin sounds good
Buy one
Anyways, he’s just saying he likes me only to attempt to get close and kill me
He’s lying
I think Skarm likes it
Yes
It’s something he learned
I have a pile of these
*throws Majestic one of my Baconators*
~~What about the Lost Levels?~~

That’s my quote about America

You didn’t know I was Squid?
Why is it Skarm is mentioning my name so much tonight?
We aren’t watching a commercial, you stupid bot
Yes.
Hey Skarm, go steal me one
Now I want a chocolate chip muffin
I’m sure
I think Skarm only has stolen cookies and sandwiches

I do want my own computer to do stuff on, instead of using my parent’s one
Good
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Oh
Expose what?
I only have one monitor
I only use Discord on the computer if I’m video editing
I just use my phone most of the time
~~They’re probably all nsfw Rarity pics~~
~~lazy~~
🎉
You don’t use Game Maker
A duel is dirty? 😏
We’re just messing with Skarm again
Oh hai Kugal
“I wasn’t taken”
Watching bull videos destroyed it
But Skarm loves you
~~He would love it~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
History talk is starting to bore me 😑
~~Get smarter~~
I can hardly imagine how the people who were friends with him are taking this
🤔
I did watch the Skype chat where a couple people talked to that guy and they asked him to turn himself in before they send in a report
It’s a pretty shitty situation
Sorry.
To put it simply, spent over a year sexting a 14 year old from the Philippines
Yep
Speaking of bronies, are you aware of what’s going on with one analysist getting in trouble, Gummy?
Yawn
He never knows
He’s mad at Tatsu?
~~Blame Dragonite for everything~~
*gets popcorn ready* That will be interesting
🤔
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
You can’t be good at everything
I’m good at this sleep thing
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Gummy*
~~I’ll take the money~~
*takes all the money* I need this
People are confusing
You’re supposed to compliment her, you ninny
I’m just saying we’re weird
We are all weird here
Yep. It’s ida
But who said that?
Ace Attorney Investigations 2
I love those times where the bot gives a message that’s perfect for the situation
I’m surprised Skarm hasn’t stolen all these cookies
That’s not just you
I remember the days where I blew up the servers
Overwatch just makes me angry
...what?
Great, now I’m hungry...
*goes back in time and gets a cookie*
Now those shifts are fucking awful
At least I get a break, unlike Friday and Saturday, which are 6 hour shifts with no break
Not looking forward to that...
I have an 8 hour shift tomorrow
Bland
Bread by itself or something on bread?
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
😏
I don’t know what that means 😛
~~In simple terms please~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*brain explodes while reading that*
I’m not even halfway there
I’m still not pink...
Ok, so through this whole show, we constantly have to deal with bad James Corden comedy and them hammering in that the show is in New York
No
The Target logo came out of nowhere at the end
It was a song that ended up being a Target commercial...
She was never really that country to begin with
With a “country” artist singing a pop song
A commercial
#StillSingle
Didn’t Flubs say she hates us? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Dragonite will be the reason that we all die
Tacos are overrated
Now that the sun has been nommed, we will all now die. Thanks Dragonite
There was a part where a couple musicians read parts of Fire and Fury; Hilary Clinton made a cameo
*noms homework*
If I hosted the Grammy’s, the first thing I would do is kick James Corden out for being an unfunny idiot
Elton John performance now
Jars of dirt and fruit flies aren’t cozy
I have a blanket
MATH
James Corden is still unfunny...
And “That’s What I Like” gets the Song of the Year Grammy
I’m bored <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
TI GNAD HSOG
I don’t make any money
Donating a lot
That’s a waste of money
Thank you, captain obvious
I need to figure out what the fuck I want to do that will make me at least decent money
I know I need a full time job
I know, with the money I have, if I had to start paying rent and other payments, I wouldn’t have any left
How am I supposed to grow up if I can’t start making my own decisions?
Anyways, I just can’t do what I want with my money. They say that’s it’s my money, but I know that they don’t give a shit
And they specifically talked about how my sister loaned money to a friend, which helped lead to her not having much money. They don’t want me to end up like her
Because I don’t contribute, they don’t want me just spending money
That’s why they’re always on my case
No
Mine; I have a job
They don’t know what Patreon is but they will ask me 1,000 questions on what it is and why I’m spending money on it
“That isn’t a real job”
“You give this guy money to play video games?”
“What did you do with this money?”
“I donated to a guy’s Patreon”
“Have you met this guy?”
“No”
“What does he do?”
“He plays video games”
My parents: You’re a fucking idiot
I will say, another reason I don’t give money out is because my parents pretty much get on my case about every purchase I make
One homeless guy near where I work asked for a dollar from me once. I didn’t give him any; he just buys beer
Like donating to a Twitch stream or Patreon
Yes, I spend money. What I’m referring to is donations
Gummy, I don’t care what you do with your money. I just don’t give my money out to people
This is my thing
Seriously though, I don’t give out money, ESPECIALLY to people who I don’t know in real life
~~I don’t give out money to anyone~~
And Chris Stapleton gets the best country album award. I’m not surprised. He had no competition
More pins
Ok, right now, I’m watching a documentary where Gordon Ramsay is saying he doesn’t want to be labeled as a celebrity. I wonder if he can say that after all his shows 😛
Spelling is yes
10 1/2 or 11
What shoe size?
JA
Cat 🐱
🤔
This quote is from a blog I follow
“Yes, Best Comedy Album is being televised, and the rock categories aren’t.”
I listen to rock and country, but lately, country radio has been literally playing anything, even if it’s not meant to be country
I think there’s before 2013 Bieber and after 2013 Bieber. Before then, he was beloved by little girls and everyone hated him. After he got into trouble and changed, more people liked him
I hate most modern music but Bruno is one of the few good ones
I still haven’t listened to Bodak Yellow so I can’t give that much of an opinion on Cardi
I like most songs from Bruno
It is
Had to get through a Cardi B verse though
Bruno Mars: an actually good singer
MEEEEMES
He’s doing a subway version of carpool karaoke and everyone doesn’t want to hear it
Ok, James Corden is painfully unfunny
*pinches Animal Man back* 😏
I only want my cookie...
It was for an app.
I just saw a commercial that had the dog emoji rapping. And the poop emoji was there
Right back at you
I’m glad Skarm didn’t go for my food
This cookie is almost as big as my hand
I’M NOT YELLING
Brb. I’m getting a cookie
LOUD NOISES
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
See?
I never expected sanity from Skarm
Ok, Kendrick Lamar won best Rap album
See?
Yeah, Skarm doesn’t care
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
It’s not anime...
*locks the door*
Song is just ok to me
Gummy, stop being perverted
Part 1 is meh. Part 2 is great
*Makes everyone watch MLP to catch them up*
~~That’s not good said the pony haters~~
You heard Gummy. Edit photos by painting them <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Everything I use, I got for free
~~And I got Premiere for free~~
WOAH MAN
The performance of Despacito finished
I’m just watching the Grammy’s
What exactly is going on?
I know
And now this made me hungry
I don’t like just having spaghetti
Either that or meatballs with the spaghetti
I’d prefer chicken parm with that
~~I’m sure Flubs will like that~~
😏
And my sister’s dog was making a lot of noise cleaning itself so that didn’t help
It felt like I kept falling asleep, have a dream, wake up, and repeat that 2 more times
I had a hard time staying asleep last night
I feel really tired 😑
Sadly ™
Despite the Switch doing well, it feels like some companies are still hesitant to work with Nintendo
Nintendo always gets the short stick in that regard
I don’t really understand the appeal. But that’s probably because I’m not creative
I got bored after a month of playing it on my Xbox One
I have a Switch. But not Minecraft.
I just want to go to the food store that gives out free samples
That was just empty stores not being put to use
*blows up the closed stores*
This is a bomb
Like me
It’s pretty boring if you don’t really like clothes shopping
I’m now at an outlet mall that’s 90% clothes stores, 5% food and other stores, and 5% closed stores
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
I know he occasionally watches those “playing with toys” YouTube videos that kids watch
Wait, what?
*blows up everything*
TOO MANY FUCKING NOISES
If he wasn’t my nephew, I’d slap him and get arrested for assaulting a toddler
He woke up from his nap 10 minutes ago and he’s still crying
My nephew has been crying a lot today
😏
WAHLUIGI
Yeah, fuck you too
*noms hashbrowns*
How do you like that Skarm?
*slaps delusional bird with a fish*
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I love how the message had my name in it 😛
That’s how you do it?
Good, Skarm didn’t nom me
*noms stolen food*
Knowing Skarm, it’s lewd. It’s always lewd
😏
As always, Skarm makes no sense
How should we know?
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Ok then
I wonder why Skarm needs water in his money
I blame Skarm for everything
😡
You had my money?
*throws rocks at Skarm* Well, this is a good way to blow off steam
I have to leave the room before I start yelling at him or worse
My nephew is now crying and pouting really loud
In the original Paper Mario, the tutorials are optional
At this point, I honestly don’t know why they think all these unskippable tutorials are necessary
However, I’m still irritated that they still haven’t made tutorials optional or skippable
For the most part, I did like some of the changes
But, my biggest problem with USUM is that they needed to change a little more to be separate
And Lillie had a little more development in the originals
Like the Looker post game story
There are a couple things I wish were in them that were in the originals
I do like USUM more
Diamond and Pearl were too slow
Those were just bland
Even though I prefer Emerald, ORAS is still good and definitely better than X&Y
I’m still 2/3 levels away from Pink Nu
🎉
I’d rather play the sequels; they’re much better
I’m turning 20 in June
They came out in 2011? I was 13
Black and White really are the most divisive Pokémon games. You either love them and they’re your favorites or you despise them
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
HIIILBERT
He still has some good moments, like his Hilbert monologue in the 1st episode
Anyways, I’m having a hard time watching Black and White because it feels like he’s overly praising almost everything and I find the games mediocre
Xenoblade is what made me stop watching him until partway through Platinum
Although, I have been having a hard time watching his Black and White Let’s play
And he’s surprisingly innocent; Chugga’s Lost Innocence
Yeah; Emile is a huge nerd
Wurmple?
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I wonder where Chuggaaconroy found that out
*sees new pin* Blame ponies for everything
Whatever
🤔
Uhh, there was still a bit in it
*uses it*
I’m at my nephew’s 3rd birthday party and there’s several kids. I feel like running into a wall
And you said darling at the end of a sentence. A guy who says that is at least a little weird
😐
Flubs saying he’s not weird is like saying my phone isn’t a phone <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
“It’s exactly what it looks like”
That’s it; your butt
Your feet
~~But you got poor punctuation~~ <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I saw the eggplant was fluxuating
Cool!
Lol
🤔
I’d nom it, but it probably has explosives in it
“This person can’t be mad; I’m mad!”
I still have my original Pokémon Gold cartridge but the battery died so I can’t save
I’d recommend it
I say Emerald or HeartGold is best Pokémon game
What game are you playing?
~~Keep playing~~
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Busy and hectic around dinner time. Slow and boring afterwards
Meh
On the bright side, I don’t have to go there this weekend
So, not only is it a long shift, but a good chunk of it will be slow and boring
It’s a 6 hour, no break closing shift tonight
I really don’t want to have to work tonight...
Gotta Stay Stupid Dan? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I think the problem was the update wasn't installing
GOTTA GO FAST
Ok, restarting the computer worked
At this point, I’m restarting my computer
A half hour later, Discord still ain’t working...
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Once upon a time
Oh, and control r did nothing
Well, the screen keeps showing “Downloading update 1 of 1” and the screen keeps opening and closing when the bar reaches the end. And Dragonite, I saw Kappa and I don’t take anything seriously when Kappa is at the end
~~Yeah, I’m not doing that~~
Ok, Discord has been updating on my computer for almost 10 minutes now and it’s still not done 😑
I remember kids in one class in high school joked about that a lot
Mlg?
I like Mountain Dew
I can only think of that going one way
😏
I think Discord just hates me
Again, all 3 of my servers went down
SOMEBODY TOUCH MAH SPAGHET
🍍 + 🍕 = 🤢
But, as I’ve probably said before, the only one I know of that I have interest in, is a Patreon exclusive server
I should find more servers to be in
The only 3 servers I’m in went down
Good
Discord working again?
*throws hot chocolate at Nothing*
With hot chocolate
And as Dragonite leaves, I come back
Can’t you go back to being Gummy? Things were less confusing back then <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
~~Is he made of froyo?~~
~~No, we said Trix~~
I just felt like saying the Trix catchphrase
Silly Animal Man, Trix is for ~~Squids~~ kids
I liked it
Once
You weren’t specific
Why?
*starts a fire because Flubs said to* And there goes my home...
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
I’m bored
REEE
*kills Gummy in place of his parents*
😨
They don’t hate me
They think it’s a waste
My parents just hate me spending money
I haven’t bought a game since early November
No, I mean just games in general. I got Xenoblade Chronicles a week ago
I have a job to afford that. But my parents already hate me spending money once a month on a video game so they would hate any more money spending
There are classes at my college that go from 5:30-8:30 or 6-9
Anyways, I was going to say that, I may get bored but it’s better than being bored and having to learn stuff I don’t care about
Bye
24
And I’m not learning anything except how to be really lazy 😛
~~SquidofThinkinator?~~
My code would probably be either SquidofThinkinator or REEEEE
I just see confusion
I still need a little over 10K experience points
JA
Because you said it

🤔
~~No one needs air~~
*noms air because why not*
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
😏
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
~~Lazy~~
Maybe because they were taught that was how you swing swords?
Maybe
I think you already know his answer
Lol
Gummy flirting will always result in him getting punched or hit with something
I don’t think so
*sigh*
~~I would bs~~
*pets cat*
I’m glad I don’t have to do anything today
And Skarm knows something. Tell us
Hey Skarm, can’t you pick better quotes?
~~I just don’t get laid~~
I think Gummy said that
I think Skarm is crazy
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Can’t be the 1st word in a sentence
Hey Skarm, mention doors
Gummy quote there
That’s my quote
Or he’s being lewd to someone. Right Skarm?
My love life is nonexistent which makes it instantly better than Gummy’s
I know it can be hard to find a real person you can love, but still
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Going on a date with a fictional character: only in your fantasies
~~Yes you are~~
Flubs is Gummy’s true waifu
Nein
😏
It’s an anime thing
~~plot or justice~~
I only played a demo of one game
No
Flubs, What is your ideal waifu then?
I hated Overwatch
On a day of the week
Hey
Same
Which makes it really difficult to watch Chuggaaconroy constantly gush over Gen 5 in his Black and White Let’s Play
Gen 5 is my least favorite
Gen 1 is my 2nd least favorite
🤔
Flubs is the King of Earrape
*looks at Master*
😏
Nothing is fun anymore...
Ok, you really shouldn’t spam it
Who cares about fucking swearing?
Because gambling
I didn’t like it
HGSS had its own thing but that was awful in my opinion
Platinum was the last game to have it
You mean the game corner?
Casino?
Story differences for one
It fixes a lot of problems
I suggest just playing Platinum instead of Diamond
Just HGSS
I have used Mewtwo against Red in HG a couple times, which really helps
I just hope there’s something
I wonder what they’ll do with the Switch Pokémon games. I hope they don’t just do more of the same and not take advantage of being on a console
I thought it was at least interesting
Sun and Moon, I feel incredibly conflicted on. Same goes for Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon.
B/W was meh. The sequels are much better. X&Y was bland. ORAS, I like but I definitely prefer Emerald.
I liked Serperior; Samurott was ok, I hated Emboar
His YouTube channel no longer exists
I remember one guy who used only a Jolteon to beat Red’s whole team
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
But you’re still enlightened now
I still will be the 1st non enlightened pink
I have
I don’t know what to say
I still need to get to level 50...
~~Don’t worry. Be happy~~
No
~~But the reference~~
ONIONS ON THE SIDE
Buttface
*noms banhammer*
I haven’t had lasagna in quite a while
~~Quick Skarm. Do it~~
He’s either doing that or mentioning Gummy
Why is it every time I nom something, Skarm noms me?
By kicking you out
Hey Skarm, stop nomming me
*noms 40 kg cake*
It’s one of the cheap personal cakes from Walmart
It’s vanilla with chocolate chips in it
I’m back with cake
Sure
I refused; I hate the smell of cigarettes
I know I got offered a cigarette once
I’m sure quite a few kids at my high school did do drugs
Why does everyone want songs about getting drunk or high?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1oQiRdoPc
The Lee Brice song?
~~But kids already make love a lot in high school~~
That part of graduating high school is great
Just stand there while everyone dances
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Well, don’t be
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I remember the last couple of weeks in biology, I was on here for half the class
I’m not a science person so I would just fall asleep
Have a good sleep in class then <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t know about you guys, but that sounds like a possible addiction
At work yesterday, one customer said he has 10 cups of coffee a day
Don’t drink coffee then
EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Nom something?
Sleep?
Go for a run?
Not as tired as yesterday, but still
FeelsTiredMan
I just realized I only have 50 minutes before I have to get ready for work <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Not much snow, but still
Yesterday, it was 50 and raining. Today, it’s 30 and it’s snowing again 😑
Why eggplant?
😏
Because you do a bad job at trying to make him cry
SquidofThinkinator

Thinking is despised by a couple people here
~~Just go on the internet for nsfw~~
😏
Who knew pancakes were the key to killing the human race
Oh god, Gummy has inspired people. We are doomed <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
This just in, Skarm is being a ninny again
No, I don’t
We don’t need Skarm to be a fashionable warlord
The mid day one
That’s a quote from me
When the pants come off, Skarm is ready to get you 😏
Yeah, any pictures like that go there
No, I’m the only one
The bot was hurt. I’m glad
*throws cigar at Skarm just because*
Huh. So a 7.9-8.2 magnitude earthquake happened off the coast of Alaska.
Burn everything? Flubs already does that
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
I don’t play League
That’s not funny <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
He finds our comments interesting
The realization made Skarm explode
He did it
Irrelevant Bella quote
What do you mean “what”? Don’t nom me Skarm
Stay out of this, Skarm
*noms the rest of Flubs’s ice cream*
How is that an ooops?
~~Are you saying we should kill Gummy?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
I think Gummy just grabbed whatever he could find
😐
Gummy, those are just placebos...
I’ve been standing so long today that just standing up now makes my feet and legs really hurt...
Same goes for the DMV
We are in America: the land of idiots who don’t know what common fucking sense is
Nope
Because people are trying to get their 5 seconds of fame by attempting to kill themselves
What?
Don’t play it
Good
Because I uninstalled it <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I haven’t played Overwatch in a while
Which character was Ana again?
😐
That’s not very *punny* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ana darts?
With how tired I am and since I have work again tomorrow afternoon, I will probably go to sleep early tonight
👋
I’m back from work and I’m really tired 😑
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*rolls away*
And now I go
Hello I’m here for 5 minutes
Well, time to work an 8 hour shift. See you guys at 7:30
I’ve had to take several exams at 8am
After I wake up, I can only go back to sleep if I literally can’t stay awake
Well, trying to sleep isn’t working out
Ok, I think I’m going to try and go back to sleep in a few minutes. I feel too tired...
Oh please. My accounting class was at 8:30.
When is it?
😏
*sees new pin*
😑
Well, today’s going to be a long day. Not only did it take me a while to get to sleep, but I also have an 8 hour shift at work today
~~Everyone here is beyond help~~
I’m still in only 2 other servers. The only other one I would be interested in joining is a Patreon exclusive server. And since my parents hate me spending any money, they would despise me giving money to a guy on the internet they don’t know
=
😐
Why would he? I don’t think he would be interested in all the mlp
No
NEIN
*noms cake*
I hate bananas and ice cream makes me sick
Although, Chugga hasn’t popped over to Black very much
Again, Chuggaaconroy
Meh. Chuggaaconroy is doing both Black and White for his Let’s Play
So it would be more than just me talking to myself 😛
I would if I had more things to say and if more people were chatting
🇺🇸
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
~~Because you’re crazy. Just like the rest of us~~
When did we bring up Dumb and Dumber 2?
The Paul Brothers are loud. You want more of them?
I don’t have any videos I want to delete
In order to have a successful channel, you need some consistency
I do think I’m going to try and set up some kind of schedule
😐
Speaking of videos, I have no idea what I should do next.
🤔
THINK
Popular among stay at home moms, probably
Really over dramatic and serious
I know what soap operas are
~~What, you need to clean something?~~
Soap?
It’s one of my favorite games
I have played and replayed HG so many times
Lol
That’s a way to wash your sock <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*sigh*
I’ve seen more lewd
*gives Flubs a sandwich for that*
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792> ?
Gelatin <:LUL:305559915714576385>
It’s not that either
No it doesn’t
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Good, Skarm didn’t steal it
*gives Flubs a cookie for that*
Gummy’s empire is the Kingdom of Treason.
The fight over 🤔 will continue for generations
JA
Sure
🤔
So, what’s the name of that emote?
Why is Skarm trying to play music? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms North America*
It wasn’t a battery alarm going off
It’s not going off anymore
Ok, we think everything is fine now. Only one of the detectors went off
Well, one of our carbon monoxide detectors just went off. I’m standing outside now

Are these worth any money here?

Then again, it’s a 20 minute video so that doesn’t surprise me
This really is Google Snail
14 minutes left
Not helping
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I can’t tell if this video file is even uploading. The circle that’s showing that hasn’t moved in 5 minutes
🐌
Really slow...
Well, Google Drive is being really slow for me...
All 10 of them? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I checked and I was 3 exp away from leveling up from checking my rank
Level up
If I ever want to talk about a movie again, I’m going to do more of a vlog style review. That will make things a little easier
I’m fine with that
When I just review one episode of a show or a song, it’s a lot quicker
It’s because I reviewed a movie
I end up not liking making videos if they take a really long time to make
I never want to have to work on a video for that long again...
ITS DONE. FINALLY.
That would
I’m just trying to finish my video and like I said before, this is taking longer than I expected and wanted...
That’s pretty much almost all of us here
Ok, I’m going to bed
Autocorrect really wouldn’t let me say hell
Yeah, so hell 😛
Welcome. Have a welcome Baconator 🍔
I’m a little late but, Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔

So...

~~Can we go back to Gummy?~~
*gives Skarm a rock* You will only get this
Rarity Glimmer The Penguin
Rarity = penguin
What’s not fair Skarm?
I bet Skarm’s next quote will be worse
Gummy did break everything
JA
Even Skarm thinks your quote was cringe 🤔
Have we seen a quote from me yet? Idk
RC quote
The fish had explosives in it?

No

<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
Be like me and don’t watch horror movies at all
This is definitely the longest I have ever worked on a video
I have been working on that for much longer than I wanted to
Speaking of creating stuff, I really need to finish a video tomorrow
“Why would you watch someone play a video game when you can play it yourself” *proceeds to watch a sport*
Some sports are boring
I only care about the Eagles
Football
On another note, the Eagles are currently winning. <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
It’s different
When he says I look weird as the first thing he said to me, I doubt he wanted to be friendly
No he wasn’t
And I wanted to say to him: “Hey jackass. I don’t know you, so you don’t need to know my goddamn name. So fuck off”
He then proceeded to ask me my name and I told him my 1st name, but when he asked for my last, I said I didn’t want to. He then said “What a retard”
It continues...
So, I was bagging for another cashier and the guy who came through the line said “He always look weird like that?” Referring to how I don’t smile much. Hard to tell if he was joking or serious
Now to tell story
👋
Ok, I’m home
Well, today is the first day someone called me a retard at my job. I’ll tell the full story when I get home in a little while
SquidofBlanket
Blankets are great this time of year
I woke up in the living room on the couch and with a blanket
I did sleepwalk once
I’ve never woken up on the floor
😐
Random thought: I had a weird dream last night. I was out jogging really early in the morning when a cat wouldn’t leave me alone. It ended up following me home. And I think characters from a tv show were around at one point. Dreams are weird.
Well, I’m bored. Skarm, do something interesting
*sees latest pin* I don’t like onions 😛
😏

And then the music stopped the chat. I guess you could say Pain caused some Pain <:Keepo:327304799919800321>

Well, MLP IS a Canadian show

I can only watch a stream for an hour. After that, I get really bored
Alright. I’ll be there in a minute
I’m back. Eyan streaming?
Alright, I need to get ready for work. I should be back for the stream tonight
~~You probably think all war movies are amazing~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~to celebrate~~
I’m eating a Baconator
I thought it was because of the cake
WAHLUIGI
I remember I was invited to be in National Honor Society in high school. But that involves doing community service and going to meetings, so no
Getting close to 49 now
How is Gummy that high and I’m still not at level 50...
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I see Master is using Ayana again
I don’t eat protein bars
Now, if you REALLY want to torture yourself watching MLP, watch G3.5
I like it
There’s endless room in my stomach
Throw me some
ITS TIME TO STOP- Filthy Frank
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Canada doesn’t equal UK
:rude:
I don’t know how to cook. I make a great frozen dinner, ham sandwich, and bowl of cereal though <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m a very unhealthy person
Sometimes twice
I have it once a week
*throws Bella to Wendy’s*
Sounds like poor living conditions
That cake looks delicious
I remember one part of a show I watched where one character who is bad at cooking made something with salt, vinegar, and Tabasco sauce
Binging With Babish is a good cooking YouTube channel
*noms cake*
Except what everyone else has
We don’t have anything
I’m talking about restaurants
No RC
I could eat fries every day
Does the Northeast have anything that the rest of America doesn’t?
It feels like the Northeast doesn’t have any of these great chain restaurants
Where is the chain mainly located?
What’s Wingstop?
No Gummy
*throws Five Guys fries at myself* I’m not letting anyone else have these
*throws Wendy’s fries at Bella*
No
Gummy

~~Gee, Thanks for that RC~~
Oh, thanks <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>

<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>

I never watched any of them

I’ll make the knife go away
I can’t remember when
I dabbed in a tweet once
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
~~What If the haters dab back?~~
That’s 2 pinned messages in 5 minutes
People don’t like dabbing here
*4 months later*
~~1 million~~
<:Senate:395030198636249089>
I know one guy on YouTube who made spam cookies
I just remembered something spam related
Dragonite mentioned spam
Spam?
Yes, I realize my name has Baconator in it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
No one should use it, in my opinion
Because you’re Gummy
Suspicious
Neither do I
Alright, what the f—k is going on now?
I just want more than 4 people to watch my latest videos
I’m still subscribed to SuperSkarmory
Either because they haven’t uploaded (Eyan is one) or I just don’t care about any of their content
There are a couple channels who haven’t made videos I’ve wanted to watch in months
Example: I watch all of StephenVlog’s videos
I watch most of them. Some more than others
I’m subscribed to 39
Before he had 10 million
I did for a little while in 2013
Also, Pewdiepie is getting close to 60 million subscribers
What about Gary?
And Skarm also has a typo
In ZealTV?
Everything sounds lewd
He’s sticking to his diet
And I’m glad Skarm didn’t eat it. I think he only eats sandwiches and cookies
Pizza was good
*bashes Gummy with a fish* MY PIZZA
Pm
But, it’s pizza time now
It’s 5:16 and I feel like going to bed
~~So a friend made out of ice and land?~~
DON’T YOU SAY THE B WORD HERE

🍕 for dinner
It’s a video game, not an anime Master
I have seen Let’s plays of P3, 4, and 5. From what I’ve seen, 5 is the best. Then 4. And 3 just came off as kind of boring with a couple exceptions
I haven’t really watched much of PQ
To P3 character?
Profile pic change

*Slaps Gummy with a fish* Do better
12 1/2 minutes recorded and edited. And I still will need 5-10 more minutes 😑
Well, I didn't think I would be spending all day so far making this video and still having a good amount of work to do
👋
Why would you put peanuts in soup?
Ok, I’m going to bed now. Any last messages I should see?
I should be sleeping right now
Creepy eyes
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
*plays calm, quiet music for Flubs*
I don’t have an intro. Why is it necessary to have an intro?
Several hours for reviews
Editing takes me several hours
Circlepromoting sounds weird
*sets up camp*
It takes over an hour for a 1080p video for me
I could probably do 4K but that’s just pointless in my opinion
I upload 1080p
Anyways, I’m putting out a video in a couple days and I hope it’s something my subscribers will like. I think this is what most of them subscribe for
😐

I’m trying
I do have 12 videos with over 1K views
I’m pretty f—ing irritated how I have 154 subscribers and very few of them care about watching my videos
My latest 2 videos only have 4 views each
And a Patreon
People like Stephen Georg do
Sick
🤢
I think YouTube can be a job if you make enough money on it, but some people will still think it’s not a job because internet
Those aren’t fast enough
I NEEDED THAT
And my parents hate that I play video games a lot and they hate me spending any money on them. They don’t like me spending money and not contributing to rent or car payments or something
Same Wolverale
I have no interests that could make me money
My parents are really pressuring me to find something to go to college for and to get a different job that what I have now
*give us your jobs*
At my college, you are able to return books the first 2 weeks of you know you won’t use it
And half the time, professors say you won’t need your books; they just have to put something required down. I’m sure the college does this just to scam more money out of you
I don’t like books, so I don’t like libraries
I never went to the library
I left that one wrapped and they still wouldn’t take it
Yeah. Whatever you do, if you have the option, DON’T GET LOOSELEAF BOOKS.
Last semester, I only used 1 of the 3 books I got. And I couldn’t get any money back for two of them
Doubtful
Most dogs don’t really like cats; I thought this was common knowledge, Gummy
😏
~~filthy casuals~~
Doesn’t look that interesting to me
Will you guys stop messing with my brick...
~~My brick was what made it work~~
Is it working yet? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*throws brick at Gummy’s phone*
I remember something happening to my phone a couple weeks ago. It ended up having to get reset to factory settings
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
Are you getting bored yet?
I remember one year, there were 2 days of school left before winter break. But, they ended up being cancelled due to how much it snowed
Wow
How many days have already been cancelled?
Most of the schools around here just had a delay
And the ones at their job
Don't encourage him <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I will have to go to my job in a little over an hour
I'm a cashier
So am I
Flubs is 19, I think
I'm pretty sure I'm almost always tired because of me being a very unhealthy eater and a lazy person'
I just almost always feel tired
But I still feel tired
I’ve been getting plenty of sleep lately
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
See a doctor?
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
Think
Yes
It would need to be a sharp piece of paper
NEIN
It’s true
A human who helps us?
You’re slow
Did Skarm really say that?
Especially against women
*grabs popcorn* This will be interesting
*noms Gummy’s $2*
~~I want the winnings~~
Maybe
My version of Adobe Premiere is also not-so-legal since I didn’t pay for it. I don’t like monthly fees at all
I’m not popular enough to warrant buying anything. Although, when I move out and I have my own computer, I might start buying stuff
Keeping with the free theme
I use OBS too
IPhone 5S
I got it from my parents in early 2015
Everything I use, I got for free
I use my phone 😛
There are ways to get slightly older versions for free; I have the 2015 version
I have Adobe Premiere
I’m more inclined with the former
Honestly, it feels like my subscribers either don’t care or my channel is part of that subscription glitch or something
~~*goes to find hot girls for thumbnails*~~
I ain’t in the mood for that
I just don’t know what to do
Needless to say, it’s really f—ing irritating
Ah, YouTube. I uploaded a video yesterday: only 3 people watched it. One more today, only 1 person
Nothing that you do is my fault, Gummy
Nein
...what?
“Down the Gummy”...
~~Yes, let Dragonite poke you with a stick~~ 😏
Not me
He ends up drinking water that has money in it
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJsciYpg88
If he’s just going to do that, then give me the money <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Then you would have a pet penguin
What?
It’s 28 here
Aaaand it’s snowing once again <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
It snowed even more last night 😑
I haven’t had a really good pizza in a long time
Night
Flubs
Yeah, setting things on fire is Stuck’s job <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
__I know, right?__
Anyways, I think my mom wouldn’t mind having another pet, but my dad is really against it. He hates having to clean up after it
I’m sure I just got used to being around my old dog
That and my parents don’t want another pet; mainly my dad
Recently, I wouldn’t mind getting a cat but I feel like it would be hard finding a hypoallergenic one
🤔
I did pet my sister’s cat for a bit today. I’m sure it likes me 😃
I wish I had another pet; I haven’t had one since 2015
😏
I was about to say that RC
Wow
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>

Actually, the bot has censored itself in the past
~~Where’s my quotes?~~
Lol
Dragonite started it and I copy it
*noms potatoes*
This is just getting weird again
Hmm, interesting

And Dragonite pinned that one...
Master just loves pinning random stuff
Lol
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
What is this based off?
Yeah
He is
He lives in the same state as me
Dragonite and/or Master, why are you doing this?
What the?
He’s ok with it
It doesn’t have water
🔫 <@335818633030795264>
Ok, I’m back with cake
What Flubs said
😐
And I have no idea how long I’ll be interested in Discord
I’m not doing monthly payments
How much does Nitro cost?
~~He makes good French toast~~
😏
Pancakes
Speaking of breakfast food, I had French toast for dinner
While you and Master go over those details, I’ll take your lasagna <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Lol
Can we have some?
🤔
Since it doesn’t exist, it doesn’t need anything
~~Does this mean I can have it?~~
I think Greenland put the undersized tires in Skarm’s car
Greenland won’t help you
*throws the explosive Baconator at Skarm before it blows up*

Here, talk like a regular Ninny
Talk like that only in MLP servers
I don’t know, why did you?
~~Medium Well Rarity~~
It’s not weird mid day because most people aren’t here then 😛
Can’t we just call you Gummy?
You hurt my brain
Gummy, don’t change your name to that
But...why do you need to help him?
Why are you helping this kid?
I’m not a fan of silent protagonists
There are a couple points where I wish he did talk
This is pretty bizarre, having this motorcycle in a Zelda game
I finally completed the Breath of The Wild DLC.
At this point, I wouldn’t care
The furthest I’ve gotten is during the Yoshi part
I died a lot in different locations
I just skip the ufo
And the vanishing platform with no cap or moped
Ah
Who’s that green loser?
~~If we got Super Wauluigi Odyssey, my life would be complete~~
Still. I feel like we need something like that
They should make it possible to play as Luigi when you 100%. Just like the Galaxy games
Lol
In total, how many moons are there?
🎉
Ok, I AM excited
And maybe I was just excited
It’s not normally on Mondays
New StephenPlays GTA Online episode is out <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
What does that have to do with anything that we were talking about?
Well, looks like the surpr- 💀
This is just a squirt gun <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>

~~I don't even have to worry about school right now~~
It's snowing right now. Not much, but still
🎉 or 😒
That's what made me think he would rob me
It had a skull mouth on it.
I have no idea what that is, Flubs
😏
I especially thought it when he reached into his coat but he was just getting change
But, he was just buying milk
Anyways, last night at work, I thought one guy was going to rob me. He had a coat with a hoodie and one of those things that protects your mouth from the cold (not a scarf).
All I know is, all the crazy/interesting stuff happens after I go to sleep
*shrug*
Master got into Stuck’s bed
*sees new pin* 😏
I got 9 hours of sleep yet I still feel tired
Ok, NOW I’m going to bed
~~I’ve seen better Rarity pictures~~
Be like me and never play Overwatch again
RC, GET OUT
*blows up Overwatch*
Gummy, you think Damn Daniel is funny? Get out
There’s barely anything to it.
That’s one of the worst memes
Shit’s going down
NEIN.
I’ve heard some people actually like her songs
And people actually like her music
That girl now has a career as a rapper now
🔥
Which meme?
It seems like the memes are focused around Knuckles and Earth-Chan
We were just talking about those
This isn’t Minecraft
~~send the children to bed before it happens~~
I knew it
Or 🤢
😏 things or 😨 things?
Ok, I’m probably not going to get an answer...
What are you going to do to Flubs, Gummy?
I’m trying to think of the other memes going on right now: all I can think of is Earth-Chan and making everything moe
I still love those memes
~~I’ve seen better memes~~
So I still don’t get the meme
I haven’t watched it either
1 1/2 levels from Pink Nu
It’s not da we
Screw sleep
No, wait. My battery said it was 48% when I plugged it in. More than it originally showed
*waves back*
And now I should go to bed. Mainly because my phone’s battery is starting to get low
😐
Like that?
*Gives Flubs a big beer*
🍺
😏
Hmmm
😏
No, we need you for this
Or he just focuses on Gummy
~~Or I say Skarm and he still hates me~~
I’m just glad to be home
So, how has everyone been today?
Oh hai Dan
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I now need to get ready for work. Brb
I’m not the biggest fan of speedruns. They’re fine, I’m just not too interested in them

“But I had a lamp!”
I just loved seeing Stephen mess with bombs 😛
Have you seen the setup on StephenVlog?
I’ll stick with just watching TheRunawayGuys and Stephen play Four Swords Adventures
I never played it
I saw the ending. I believe Emile was saying he was liking it more than he used to and Jon was more like “F— this game”
Didn’t TheRunawayGuys also do that game recently?
What would AAAAAAAAH be about?
Josh doesn’t seem to know all the buttons very well <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh
Where he boosted off the mountain?
Lol
I’m surprised it took him that long to realize
“Oh my god. I’m on someone else’s truck”
Did you see the last one with Stephen riding an NPC’s truck?
Yep
For the most part, I mainly watch all the Stephen and Friends videos. But now, I’m following Super Mario 64
I don’t think I’ve watched any of the SNES classic videos they made
New or old video?

I’ve said better
I don’t think Skarm will ever understand that
*noms something*
Example:
I can do that perfectly fine myself
~~Are you TRYING to kill me?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ok, I’m getting bored 😑
Some explosives are <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Kmart?~~
Is it a warm place?
~~Walmart?~~
😏
~~makes a train out of 🚽~~
~~You’ll know my pain when you die a thousand more times~~
I can fix that *Throws all of the snow here to Flubs*
There’s still snow here
~~Dragonite will forever be known as Bob~~
eew Bob
A sport is something people go to; it gives them an excuse to get drunk
They’re the only football team I really care about
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
The Philadelphia Eagles won and are moving on!
I’m currently playing the post game of Ultra Moon
I did nothing but play video games all day
It was ok
I’m high on life
I did neither
😏
~~Flubs?~~
I see see
My hair gets thick and curly; I hate it
I also hate talking to people. Yet I’m looked as a weirdo for not liking it or having much interest in it
I just don’t like people touching me or my hair
What Flubs said 😛
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>

HMMMM
🤔
I feel like a garlic bread chicken Parmesan sandwich would be better
*throws it somewhere else*
I’ll be 20 in 5 months

~~Now we need the bot to steal a sandwich or cookies~~
*does something interesting*
So, negative time is orgasmic to watch?
~~In Vancouver~~
We haven’t talked about ZealTV in a while
Lol
Gummy’s message was deleted but no one deleted it
*blames Skarm for no reason*
You didn’t delete it?

I’m pretty sure “Set Fire to the rain” is a song lyric

<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>

Wow
What is that exactly?
😏
Lol
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Yesterday, it was almost 60F. Today, it won’t get over 20 and there’s snow on the ground
*slow clap*
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
I’ll do that face whenever it works
😏
Unless you live an incredibly sheltered life
Yeah; everyone does it at some point
~~why does it matter if you read lewd stuff or not?~~ 😏
It was almost 60 today
😐
“Snow and ice accumulating 5 to 8 inches overnight”
Lol

~~Nein~~
~~Thanks for the tip~~
My problem is, I make the same mistakes a few times, not learning what I need to do
And I will ~~never~~ complete it someday
~~It’s either Mlp, military music, or Taylor Swift~~
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
Are you frustrated yet?
It seems he liked the burger
*throws a Baconator* Skarm, go do something over there, if you know what’s good for you
*throws a boulder at Skarm*
You can’t do that either
You can’t get rid of me that easily
*crawls out of Dragonite’s wall*
They’re making tacos. I don’t think tacos are very good
Well, dinner’s not going to be very enjoyable tonight...
~~Flubs just loves you and he loves talking to you, Gummy~~
Yeah, in B&W, they rushed the Plasma arc and for what? A pointless filler arc of going around some islands
Weird how Team Flare wasn’t good in the game but a lot better in the anime
I didn’t get invested in the Gen 6 anime until the 2nd half
4
6
2 and 3
1
7
5. This is how I rate the anime(s) from favorite to least favorite
The larger a fan base is, the more idiots are in it
With how big the Pokémon fan base is, there’s going to be a lot of clashing opinions. Plus children and immature adults who can’t calmly debate the anime without going for blood
It seems like the anime debating now is between Gen 6 fans vs Gen 7 fans
I don’t get why some people do like the Sun and Moon anime
In the game, Bianca mildly annoyed me. In the anime, I HATED HER
~~Not you?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And I HATED the B&W anime
I don’t like a lot of the Pokémon, the region of Unova is meh to me, and I thought the story could be greatly improved; it did have some good ideas
Gen 5 is my least favorite. I was 13
I’ve watched Platinum, Splatoon 2, and Luigi’s Mansion 2. I skipped Skyward Sword. Pokémon Black, I might stop watching because I’m getting annoyed with Emile’s almost constant gushing over it when I think the game is mediocre
I’m probably going to actually watch Chuggaaconroy’s Xenoblade Chronicles Let’s play if I need help with something. I skipped it when it first started and that’s when I stopped watching him until sometime during Pokémon Platinum
One thing I don’t like is how, for side quests, I can’t track where they are on the map. Like, when I need to return an item to someone
Do other people think what I do?
I’m only an hour and a half into the first Xenoblade. So far, I’m not too interested. It feels like a slow start
I just bought the first Xenoblade Chronicles
Fighting games bore me too quickly
I never played it
I played Donkey Kong Country Returns but skipped Tropical Freeze
And Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze
Santa?
I never played Twewy
I saw it
I only want Emerald to be on the eshop
I'm almost always tired
Mid day, there's not much activity
~~It's moments like these that make me wish we still had the e!gummy command~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
I haven't really went into finding those yet, except for one
Hmm
Or just dumb?
I'm reviewing Cars 2 and there's a line that goes "Be yourself here. And if people won't take you seriously then they need to change." And then I play a clip of Logan doing something stupid. Does that sound funny?
It involves taking a jab at Logan Paul <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ok, I just thought of something (possiby) funny I can do for something in a review
It will be 15 Sunday with a low of -12
It's almost 60 here
It will snow later'
Still raining here
Lol
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~I got it without using any glitch so I’m better~~
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
👻
9⃣
NEIN
🤔
It’s a board game
Life
~~It’s why I’m here so much~~
Yeah, that’s about right
I mean...
My usual excuse is ~~I have no life~~
~~At least I have an excuse to not leave the house~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Tomorrow night, 3 to 5 inches of snow
Tonight
“Rain and snow melt may lead to flooding”
It probably gets views
Weather and news stations always do that
We’ll be getting snow this weekend. Tonight and through tomorrow, rain
This is going to be really shitty
And I have to work Sunday night
It’s in the 50s through tomorrow so the cold is going to hit hard
It’s going to get to -10F Sunday night :FeelsColdMan:
It’s pretty quiet here tonight
Here’s your happy birthday Baconator 🍔
I hate having those stupid moments
For a second, I started looking for my phone but then I realized I was watching YouTube on it. <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
*sigh*
I can’t use my Wii U’s pro controller for this
No wait, it still has to install for twenty minutes <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Ok, it's finally done downloading
If I knew it would take that long, I would've started a while ago 😛
I know...
1 hour to download <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Never mind; I pushed the wrong button
Weird; it won’t allow me to just add how much money I want to the game
The original, not the Switch sequel
Ok, I’m going to buy Xenoblade Chronicles now.
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I understand why there are ports
I know, I just feel like there should be a little more original games
I have mixed feelings on all these ports
I never played any Kirby game and I have no interest in starting
Also, DK in Mario and Rabbids
Idk
~~That’s what I was going for~~
I ain’t bad doing English two
Grammar good
~~I don’t understand it either Bella~~
So, what photo editing software would you guys recommend to me? I don’t think I need any yet, but it would probably help in the future
I am putting <:Kappa:374346980136058893> in my video. I feel great 😛
Warm=comfortable
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
“Art”
Something happen? I wasn’t looking
*looks at that someone*
🤔
And I’ll probably end up using a guide for a good chunk of moons that I can’t find
I don’t think I’ll be able to get every single moon without getting burned out
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
If you do, I will ~~hate you~~ congratulate you
F*** THAT AREA
Oh
Culmina Crater?
~~Hack the game~~
~~Cheating is always the answer~~
Ah. Like the vanishing one. I hate those stages
I haven’t found that one yet
Not those ones
I keep running into the stairs
And the Yoshi fire island
I was referring to the vanishing platform one
Yes RC. And no Master.
Ok, I’m finding stages in Mario Odyssey that are making me want to pull my hair out again...
Especially the explosive ones
I’ve nommed worse here
*noms food* That solves the problem
~~A vacuum?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yep
Actually, with how I’m dressed in game, it’s more like Super Wauluigi Odyssey
New save file
I’m playing the Dark side of the moon in Mario Odyssey again. Why? *shrug*
Oh hai Bella
Not really how it comes across 😛
That’s funny, coming from the guy who started the “Sleep is for the weak” movement here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t understand how I always get enough sleep yet I still feel tired really early 😑
🤔
~~Chat’s not dead until I nom something that kills me~~
That’s just boring
Yes
It’s slower than the jump rope one, so it would be better if they did 50
I’m not getting to 100 in that one
~~I’m also good at eating food~~
Even with making videos, I don’t have as much motivation as I used to
~~I don’t have any hobbies~~
Currently, I have so much free time, it’s annoying
I have a lot of free time, but I’ll probably have less when the college kids at my job will go back
Clubs? We don’t have any golf clubs here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why not? Frozen?
It’s going to rain here in a couple days
Since it’s been very cold for a little while now
Starting to actually get a little warmer
So how about that weather?!
...
I was just thinking that
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~a little late but whatever~~
“Professional”
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Random thought: I just found out there’s tortilla chips in the shape of footballs
Welcome. Have a late Baconator 🍔
Listening to that song you mentioned now. Yep, it’s an earworm
I thought P3 was kind of boring, at least compared to 4 and 5
Listen to P5
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
UGHHHH to you too
The way you said there’s blood, I thought there was a lot 😛
Oh
But what if you bleed out?
Does that make you feel something?
🤔
How is that lucky?
I once had a door slam shut on my middle finger
Oops?
*noms logic*
Or make a kite out of explosives
~~Just go buy a kite~~
🥁
It’s a good way to waste time when you’re bored
Or maybe it’s because he can’t shoot you
I see Skarm still likes you
😏
Lewd
I say he can’t control it and he’s too lazy to try <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why is it now fine for Skarm to kill me?
Hey
All we need is cookies being stolen and we will have the bot in a nutshell
3 times in a row
That makes Skarm a little more predictable
You don’t team by being unpredictable
So, Skarm has become predictable yet unpredictable at the same time
Either that or say something about Gummy
You want to fight again?
As always, I question the logic of Skarm
~~RC is not general buttface. The bot said so~~
Just milk
*noms something* Does this infuriate you Skarm?
It’s not working out
*goes looking*
Ok, I ran out of things to do, as per usual
~~You’re going to sink~~
*Gives Gummy a toy car* Here you go
~~Stuck in a Mudslide~~
*rip*
I saw that
Is there region locking?
It’s a possibility
Same with Jake; I did see the H3H3 podcast with Jake on it
I’m sure Logan ups it up for the camera, since kids love watching him being a jackass. But I bet he is still obnoxious off camera
~~Can I have some?~~
I saw that
I haven’t had it in so long
*reads older messages* Now I want lasagna...
Since Logan probably removed the video himself
They didn’t
I saw part of his Japan vlogs; it’s incredibly obnoxious
Acting like a jackass
He’s making too much money for them
<@319638082867691521> What’s wrong with @ yourself? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

So, YouTube finally did say something about the Logan Paul stuff
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Don’t you hate it when you’re working and you just want to be home and relax, but when you’re home, you get bored quickly due to not having anything to do and you want to go somewhere?

Nose is pretty stuffy; it makes sleeping hard
I feel kind of sick too
As long as you aren’t right by it, it’s fun
I remember at a NASCAR race I went to, someone had an air horn
Btw, I remember at my high school graduation, we had someone in the audience bring an air horn
It’s a waste of my time

Well, I’m going to eat dinner in now.
What?
I was recording/editing a video earlier. I forgot how much time goes into reviews
They put big chunks of potatoes in; it’s great
I’ve only eaten it at one restaurant
Baked potato soup is great
Their chicken noodle is awful. Bad chicken, mushy noodles, and bad tasting broth
*makes Master zoom in*
I prefer tomato soup and baked potato soup myself
Don’t eat Campbell’s chicken noodle soup. It’s awful

Man, I haven’t been feeling good these past couple of days. It seems like, no matter what I eat, a couple hours later, I don’t feel good. Not bad enough to get sick, just not well
~~That’s not poison is it?~~ And poking me doesn’t help
Well, I feel tired
Oh, I love technical difficulties...
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
And I keep waking up earlier than I want to because my nose is stuffed; it’s hard to breathe when I’m laying in bed
I just fell asleep like always
~~It means you have no life~~
I remember senior year, a couple guys and I always played this game called Tank Trouble
I got a lot of time out of Bloons td 5
That was back when I didn’t have a job or money to spend on video games
I played TF2 for 20 hours. Then I uninstalled Steam from my computer <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
LIAR
😐
I only played Skyrim out of those 5
*noms walls*
I did recently watch a part of his video on Pokemon RSE
No
I just look for books that increase my skill levels
I never actually read that
I love exploring open worlds and making my character extremely powerful
I love exploring open worlds and upgrading my equipment or getting better stuff
That’s how I felt in Fallout 3 with the combat
The world of Fallout 3 was just so bland and boring to look at, I couldn’t get interested enough to explore it
I got so into exploring the world of Fallout 4; that’s where most of my time was spent. I just couldn’t do that with 3.
I’ll admit, 4 ain’t perfect. It has too many glitches and it crashed on me too many times
I only played 3 because I got it free with Fallout 4
I got over 350 hours out of Fallout 4. I only got 20 out of 3
Awful graphics and color pallete which made the world boring to look at, stiff gameplay/1st person shooter mechanics, and an uninteresting story that ends the game when you finish the main story, which is the worst thing you can do to with an open world game. Talking about 3 here
As for Fallout, I only played 3 and 4. I love 4, but I hated 3
I only played Skyrim
I like using the infinite carry capacity glitch in Fallout 4
*judges in Lydia’s place*
I don’t even know why I bother getting all the dragon bones and scales when I never get my smithing level high enough to use them 😛

I only played the 3 Zelda games I mentioned
I don’t know, I think Ocarina of Time might be a little overrated; I definitely prefer A Link Between Worlds and Breath of The Wild
No wait, I got Epona
I didn’t play that far into Ocarina of Time. I think I only got to where I got the Master Sword and went further in time; I didn’t go further than that

Aren’t we still stubborn assholes?
~~burn them~~
~~self promoting to yourself?~~
And Flubs got replaced by Master
🤔
NOW RC IS SELF PROMOTING
SAME GOES TO YOU
~~I have over 55K~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Switching channels allows me to see it
On mobile
No kappa

Why would Flubs eat cake with those in it?
*noms cake* that solves your problem
I told you, I have my waterproof gun 🔫
I’m here now. Sitting on the beach
This fire https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrL7CCHuP0
~~Flubs is too busy playing with fire~~
As I said earlier, most mlp fans don’t want to be lumped in with the furry fandom
😏
🔫 
I have my waterproof gun
*swims to Florida*
WHY CAN’T I JUST BE IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING?!
Wait, where is Magfest being held?
😃
That’s still colder than where I am
And I already have socks
😠
Someone get me to someplace warm
It’s really windy here. And it’s going to get to 1 degree tonight
Yes
Red
I only record one at a time
I’m only on editing part 2
I have no idea
*noms shield*
There has actually been debate within the mlp fandom on whether or not they want to be considered furries
It would be for the best RC
*doesn’t really care*
Dark
Then, how about green? I like the combination of black and green
Oh
What is stroke color?
Stroke color?
<@199725993416589313> Black is fine
Or loaded baked potato
Bacon cheese fries
Except salt potatoes; those suck
I love potatoes; I can have them almost every day and not get sick of them
*noms potatoes*
~~Flubs will supply the explosives~~
So Skarm will forever be a dick to his creator
What lady?
Now Dragonite joins me on Skarm’s hate list
Ok, so the music video for the Bruno Mars/Cardi B song looks like it’s straight out of the 90s
And he would be awful at it if he tried
The only good thing about Skarm is when he doesn’t steal my cookies
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
Dadbot?
I’m impatient
YEAH
109 to be exact
I DID IT! I GOT OVER 100 IN THE JUMP ROPE MINI GAME IN MARIO ODYSSEY
I just make videos when I feel like it
I’m pretty inconsistent with my uploading; I don’t really have a schedule
Pokémon Sage
The most viewed video when I search this game in YouTube is 767K views, so it’s at least known in the fan game community
It’s a fan game so that’s still in production so there’s probably not much good artwork so far
Alright
For a while, I didn’t even make thumbnails; I just found an image in Google to use. My first thumbnail I actually made was for am animation review a few months ago
Meh, mine doesn’t look professional in the slightest
Region is called Urobos, I think
Gummy, it’s a fan game.
Uhh, I guess if you want to do that, that’s fine but I can’t guarantee I’d use it. Idk
🤔
I didn’t know what else to put there
You mean on the right side or the black text?
And?
Ok, I got cookie cake now. This stuff is delicious
What’s wrong with it?
<@199725993416589313>
What doesn’t look right and what video are you talking about?
What?
🤔
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*looks at Gummy’s notes* No, setting people on fire is not a good way to make friends. ~~Did Flubs tell you this?~~
*goes back to Pokémon*
😐
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
~~My life is so eventful~~
I’ll be fine. Now if you excuse me, there’s a police officer here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*steals cake from mail guy and throws it to magfest*
*sends a cake to Eyan*
Eyan’s Birthday is today?

Whatever. Anyways, Sony Pictures is making a Slender Man movie
So, he’s an a writer. Well, that explains how I don’t know him. I don’t care about literature
Oh, he created that character?
Name some of his more famous work
I never heard his name
Never heard of him
Who?
😏
~~Is that the new Mario character?~~
“Moon Lord”
We’ll be here all day if we want to put logic into Mario games
Also, why do none of the “People” need air on the moon?
🤔
~~It’s even darker than the dark side of the Force~~
No, Master. The Darker side is the last area
Just don’t even try with the Darker side, unless you feel like torturing yourself
~~Now do the Darker side~~
~~At least my videos don’t make people go deaf~~
~~he was too busy getting cancer again~~
*goes back to video recording/editing*
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
*noms wheels*
Ok, I can’t stop coughing. I’m recording a video, which makes this a really bad time for it to start...
Not far north from me, the temperature won’t rise above 0 Saturday
Oh hai Flubs. We don’t have too much snow here
I’m on the edge of the east coast storm; we’re only getting a little snow, but it’s going to get REALLY cold
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
~~You would go further than hugging~~
~~It’s a MLP song, isn’t it...~~
My brother in law likes it
I have never seen Game of Thrones
Why was I @ messaged?
I never played a Castlevania game
What type of game is Order of Ecclesia?
There aren’t very many new people who talk at least occasionally. Only a handful
*more minions for Zeal*
Never saw it then
That wasn’t what I was <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Shhh
~~just dig up~~

~~You have to pay YouTube for that~~

Jacksfilms made a video making fun of Logan’s apology video
Speaking of Logan...
~~don’t be like Logan Paul~~
~~Be the legal drinking age~~

The serious debates here in the Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells and Whatever Draco Feels Like Adding ™
It’s a water gun
*shoots water at RC*
🔫
Which I won’t get because I’m never going to be able to get through it the Darker side
~~The Wauluigi costume is the best~~
🤔🤔🤔
~~I didn’t know they had explosives~~
🤔
*noms them* This also solves the problem
At the beginning of my channel, I didn’t even edit my videos
This is probably not legal
I got Premiere for free
I still just edit thumbnails in Premiere; because I don’t have Photoshop
That’s stupid
For April Fools, film with a camcorder
Uhh, I already nommed it
I do a side box but I only show what Pokémon are available in the area
It’s the Pokémon bios that take a lot of time
I’m playing Pokémon fan games which only have one screen
I’m having more fun playing the games I let’s play than editing them; especially with how much work I’m putting into one of them
Fire, not so much with rock
Either way, both moves would be good for it
I got some use out of thunder fang
Ultra Moon: Thunder Fang
Ultra Sun: Fire fang
This is why you need to phrase your words better, Gummy
I’m using the dusk form
I knew that would get pinned
My pizza to be specific
*noms food*
Also, if you breed that specific Lycanroc and the offspring have the same ability, you can keep getting the Dusk form
I loved using Lycanroc
I got that Rockruff
Ok, I think I’ll play Mario Odyssey again. However, I don’t feel like attempting the Darker side of the moon any more only to continue getting more and more pissed off.
I like cats and dogs. As long as I’m not allergic to the cat
*noms it*
Being younger = More likely to die; according to Dragonite
~~I’m young~~
Lol
Gummy is level 62? <:WutFace:327309186432237569>
If you are going to get Novocain in your mouth, eat before so you won’t be hungry
This f—ing sucks...
I still can’t feel it
I guess in the side of my mouth that’s numb, I’m biting down on gums or something because it was bleeding
Well, I still can’t eat <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
😏
~~the real name is Bob~~
I don’t feel it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m back with a numb mouth that’s annoying me because I want to eat
Ok, I’m really getting bored and my legs really do feel funny, thanks to the laughing gas
Everything that goes into my body here kills me
Will the leeches kill m- 💀
I also have laughing gas, so this also helps me feel weird 😛
*burns building down* Well, now I won’t get my cavity filled...
I’m bored
He’s still not back...
Ok, I better stop chatting here. He should be back soon
🤔
My mouth feels weird; one side normal, one numb
2 shots of it
Well, one side of it
Now I’m just waiting for the Novocain to finish numbing my mouth
Ok, it’s time
😐
Cavity needs filling
Dentist
Well, now I’m just waiting here for my appointment to start
~~Trust no one~~
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I don’t play many fighting games either
You’re supposed to go every 6 months
My family has been at my dentist for decades
It lasted a couple hours
Last time, I tried to drink a soda and I had a hard time getting the top in my mouth
That’s a pain
The main thing I’m not looking forward to today is afterwards, the Novocain making my mouth numb
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*shrug*
I need braces but we never got them put in
“I don’t know how my surgery went. I wasn’t there.” Stephen 2017
This is a funny vlog
Speaking of embarrassing yourself on drugs... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FworrwPQGJY
JA
🤔
I think I probably won’t need to get my wisdom teeth out; I haven’t heard otherwise
I have to meet my dad there; he needs work done too
😐
I have to go to the dentist to get a cavity filled
Alright
Oh hai folks
With how a majority of the game isn’t that hard, a level like this can make me slowly dislike the game. I can’t keep attempting this level
After about an hour of playing it, I only got halfway there once. I can’t stop dying early on
OK, F—K THAT LEVEL
I got past the boss rush part of the moon. Now, I’m at the long, difficult area with no checkpoints part of a Mario game
Alright
👋
Well, I’m now at the Darker side of the moon in Mario Odyssey and now I’m frustrated. Again.
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*burns a sock* AM I STILL DOING IT RIGHT?!
*throws socks at Flubs* Am I doing it right?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e9r5hx47kxM
*plays Super Mario Odyssey music*
*noms blocks*
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
I’m having cereal so HA
:donkey:
I now have over 500 moons, thanks to the Toadette achievements
Oh my god, Mario can be in a dress 😐
Ok, how does a taxi get onto the moon without hitching a ride on a spaceship?
Ok, I’m now at 473 moons in Mario Odyssey
Never make videos Skarm
Lewd
That’s life
I told you, I’m fine. Bullets don’t affec- 💀
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I’m fine
There
*noms bullets*
That does nothing
If Skarm comes near them, I can’t promise he will come out of this in one piece
*noms my own  cookies*
I say Skarm is Satan when he steals our food
A cookie
Make sure Skarm doesn’t steal them
I’m playing Mario Odyssey
Hello Flubs
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
And it’s going to get even colder later this week
And now, I must go to work when I don’t even want to leave the house because of it getting cold
I think it’s to prevent stuff like that from happening again
I think I went to sleep before they got banned
Sorry 😛
~~oh, I’m doing fine~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
JA
🤔
They didn’t have much good
I actually was at a buffet a couple days ago
~~We will need security for keeping Skarm away~~
What food would be served?
The Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells isn’t a restaurant <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
Even though others here talk about other servers, it’s only <:Treason:396483914803445761> when I do it
Like when I talk about other servers
~~The unspoken rule of Zeal: no diss tracks. It’s treason~~
<:Treason:396483914803445761>
~~It better not be a diss track~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I feel really tired but I need to get ready for work
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
I don’t think Skarm will ever get “his shit together”
I think Skarm is beyond being able to be fixed 😛
Who made that?
😐
~~Keep shipping in the fan fiction~~
😐
You must now become an air conditioner, Gummy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yes
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
I first read that Gummy was an air conditioner 😛
I wonder why Skarm now responds to that?
Well, now Skarm has something else to censor now
I’m also a mlp fan. You can’t get through without coming across something nsfw at some point
Again
😏
😏
~~of course it does~~
The news outlets will take any chance to shit on the internet
They’re mostly young kids who probably don’t understand the situation
Yep
It’s awful
I did watch his latest vlog which showed him and his friends wearing Pokemon merchandise and acting like jackasses in the city
TheAnimeMan did go over some of those pretty well
I just don’t get how people can defend Logan after this
Oh right that.
Wait, what?
This blew up fast
My Twitter feed is full of people talking about Logan Paul
2 new people overnight?
Ok, I’m going to sleep now
That’s half the people in my town 😛
Not very many big towns
I live in rural Northern Pennsylvania
We only had around 150 people in my graduating class and we were one of the biggest schools around, in terms of people in it; my town has a little over 3,000
Did you guys go to city schools in order to have that many people?
We had a couple picnic tables; only 3 I think
How big was the cafeteria?
Wait, I think it might have been close to 600. My graduating class was around 150
We had over 500 kids; 3 lunches
And because it was senior year, most seniors leave for lunch so I didn’t have many options of people to sit with
It was a pain
Then Lunch A, 5B, 6C and 5A, 6B, Lunch C
For me, it was 5A, Lunch B, 6C
They shortened lunch periods from 40 minutes (every class) to 30 minutes and depending on if you had the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd lunch, mid day would be different
Mainly around the lunch periods
I remember my last year at my high school, they changed up how the class schedules are which made things very confusing
It’s going to get in the negatives for the lows
So, how about that weather?!
Gummy, you still need to play Skyrim
*lies down and dreams of just going to one convention*
Wow, there’s a lot of green here today
~~have fun vomiting Dragonite~~
Keep it out of here
I spent my day trying to get my phone fixed. Like I said earlier, I got it fixed
Happy New Year 🎉
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
🐐
~~More chickens~~
Wait, he skipped a level 😐
Nice way to level up
The treason emote was updated?
I chat a little bit in one other server but I still spend a ton of time here
You should have learned that before MLP
I want to punch me for even thinking that my old YouTube videos were a good idea
I was an idiot socially
I don’t want to meet 2009 me; I hate how I used to be
We already have <:KappaPride:379352530863521792> for our color emote
No
I don’t like the looks of that one
Blame Master for making it
Why does everyone hate the ThinkingSteps...
<:ThinkingSteps:396534879833292810>
And more recently, a coworker
Except maybe with other kids in school
I don’t know anyone because I never talked with any fans back in the day
That’s a greeting
I remember seeing a tank
With His tank
I’m reminded of all the copy-paste stuff from when Google Plus was first mixed with YouTube
I don’t know
I wouldn’t know any of this; I haven’t really interacted with any other fans until this year 😛
If you make YouTube a lot of money, then you get to do whatever
Ok, I’m never going to complete this jump
I can’t get close
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I can’t make the jump
Ok, I’m playing the original Mario Bros level in New Donk City and I can’t get the last moon shard
Nintendo must really like the t-rex
I know that area RC
I never played any Crash Bandicoot game; never had a PlayStation
Got the 2 power moons easy but really?
Good lord that what ridiculous 😐
I found it. I passed it several times. Sometimes, I feel like a blind idiot
Ok, RC, I can’t find what you’re talking about
Which one?
Oh right, I need to try that
Ok, 51 in jump rope and I have concluded that I will never get to 100
Too many tutorials artificially pad out a game, ruin replayability, and teach us stuff we already know or could easily learn ourselves
Because they aren’t getting it
Someone tell Game Freak
Can’t we just be allowed to SKIP tutorials?
Because everyone who plays Pokémon is an idiot 6 year old who doesn’t know what Pikachu is
No, they keep adding more tutorials with each installment and keeping the old ones
They really don’t know who plays their games
They just keep adding more each game
Another example of Pokémon becoming easy
Since X and Y Flubs
Ok, so far, I got a record of 49 at jump rope. I don’t know how I’ll get to 100...
😒
Ok, I got 381 of the moons in MARIO Odyssey so far
SUPER WAHLUIGI ODYSSEY
I like The Last Jedi, but the pacing was a little clunky
Oh
Commander? From which movie?
*throws doors at someone else*
*steals more doors*
Anyways, the photos on my phone were saved on the Cloud so I at least have those still 😃
😒
Now Jello is Head ~~Butter~~ Jello
I’m always tired
:FeelsTiredMan:
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
That’s a tip I can give to anyone: if you have something important saved on technology (contacts, passwords, etc) write the down in the case that you lose them
I really should have written some of this stuff down
Well, there is the ICloud which does save stuff
IPhone 5S; I’m not sure if the Cloud saved my contacts
I still need to check but I think I lost them when my phone got “restored”
Now I don’t have the numbers of a couple of my friends so I pretty much have to wait until they text me; and only 1 regularly does so...
I really wish I never had to go through all of this with my phone
Ok, now that I’m home, I need to download all my apps again
Be back in a few; need to go home
My phone crashed and I couldn’t do anything
It was a pain in the f—ing ass to get my phone working, which involved setting it back to factory settings
Ok, my phone is finally working and I downloaded Discord again...
So, I won't be on here much tonight; I don't feel like sitting at this computer all night
My phone isn't working right and it won't get fixed until we go to Verizon tomorrow
I'm back from work and I'm not in a good mood...
~~How about using a mower for a snow castle?~~
It isn’t even going to reach 10 degrees today 😑
Oh, that one. I don’t like the looks of that one

~~HE WAS THINKING~~
I’m sure no one will get what I’m talking about
~~picky penguins~~
Brb
😐
No Santa Squid anymore
Ok, I changed my profile pic back
😏
🤔
I’d nom that if I didn’t eat pie
Did Skarm steal them?
Good job
Exactly
Emoji Movie
Why would you shoot the cookies?
Make sure Skarm doesn’t steal them Flubs
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
🤔
What’s going on?
😏
So far, there’s not too much different in Ultra Moon from the originals. There are a few things, but I heard that most of the bigger things happen later
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
No
So far, I like the beginning of Ultra Moon a little better but I still hate not having a choice of skipping the dragged out “catching a Pokémon” tutorial
Idk. I’ve been busy with Pokémon
.
I guess he didn’t want people to think he hated the movie
I know Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) didn’t like his role
And I’m now going to start Pokémon Ultra Moon. The movie was alright; I enjoyed it
Star Wars
I’m back from the movie
I just wish they didn’t play commercials on top of previews though
The theater here has large recliners for the seats. It’s amazing
Well, I’m going to see the new Star Wars movie today
*noms something*
Ok, I ran out of things to do
~~buy one~~
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I’m at 230
Ok, now I’m going to try and do the 100 jump rope thing and try to not go insane
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Feels like one of those old tactics to artificially make your game longer; that Is, if you really care about completion
Why would you want a skeleton outfit for that much?
There’s even an outfit that makes you look like Mario from the Super Mario 64
WAHLUIGI
But at least Mario can pretend to be Luigi. That’s the closest we’ll get to Super Luigi Odyssey
Yoshi’s in this game. It is now perfect
🤔
9.5/10 because no game is perfect
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
And with that, I have beaten Super Mario Odyssey
Speaking of whom
I’m not sure
Yes?
I think I’m finally getting to the final boss in Mario Odyssey
Oh hai Ninny Nerd
Isn’t Skarm always fighting against someone?
*shrug*
<:Treason:305563730056314880>

~~He would copy Eyan if he used only a camcorder~~
So you say
Uh huh...
“Are you a boy or a girl? Is there a 3rd option?” Eyan 2012. Well, watching through these old Let’s plays gives a lot of good Eyan quotes
I agree with ~~Satanite~~ Santanite
Lol
Hooray to not having anything else to do! <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m still the closest person to Pink Nu
~~No Garfield Kart?~~
~~I’m lazy~~
The only games I play on PC are Pokémon fan games. Speaking of them, I need to edit my next video. But I don’t feel like it 😑
~~I don’t use Steam~~
I’ll probably get Pokémon Ultra Moon tomorrow; I have a gift card from Christmas
I’m not buying one for $70 for my Switch though
I have one for the Wii U
~~Pro Controller~~
I stopped at the beginning of Xenoblade and I didn’t watch him until sometime during Pokémon Platinum
All I know about the game is that it made me not want to watch Chuggaaconroy for quite some time 😛
Speaking of Wii U VC, I might get Xenoblade Chronicles on it sometime next year if I get bored
I don’t really care about getting those classic consoles too much
“Yay, computer issues ftw!” Eyan 2010
😒
It does it on its own
I don’t
I really hate how my phone keeps randomly restarting on me
🤔
It was 2 hours and 10 minutes long
Ok, Wonder Woman is finally over. I still wish movies didn’t need to be over 2 hours long...
*noms camera*

F
Press F to pay respects
15 eyes?
You’re job is to nom, which is why you did this
“Why I love Flubs”
🤔
Same
💀
Children never leave cats alone; they like grabbing them and hurting them
Oh god, there’s still 45 minutes left...
An hour and a half into this and I don’t think I’ve reached the climax of the movie yet
Ok, why are all action movies so long? Always over 2 hours?
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
HMMMMMMMMMMM
hmm
🤔
I guess Skarm would rather hug random numbers than Nightshade
Master’s gpu is better than Nightshade according to the bot
I see Skarm likes stuff like that
So far, this movie is ok. I’d probably like this more if I was a bigger fan of action movies
Skyrim it is then
Ok, I’m bored. I know my dad got Wonder Woman, which we’ll watch tonight. But I don’t know what to do until then
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
A heat stroke when it’s freezing?
🤔
~~I always knew Master would get banned~~
~~Play the worlds smallest violin~~
I find it funny how we left that 1 random by himself right after he joined

Probably
This is spooky 🤔

Just a second. I’m going to my computer
Sure, I guess
I like Cards Against Humanity
Will You Press This Button
Oh hai
Flubs will love that
55%-45%. Some people really like Tumblr 😑
I don’t use Tumblr so I wouldn’t care 😛


Now I want to play
Oh
What are you reading RC?
I like country music
🤔
I guess Dragonite wants to be the only one who noms stuff so he has Skarm nom me when I nom something
Ok, I see what’s going on
*noms ghost*
No Baconators? Not worth it
~~I still don’t drink~~
‘Merica
Hey Skarm, why do you hate me?
Wait, what? I wasn’t listening <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Once he makes you an enemy, he won’t let up
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
What the hell?
😐
*noms cookies*
See?
Next thing you know, he’ll steal some sandwiches and cookies
Lewd...
Is it possible for Skarm to not be lewd?
What did I do?
He finally got it
Hey Skarm, do something
Ok, I’m weirded out now
😐
😐
Lol
“Darling” wow you really are turning into Rarity
...Fulbs?
In my case, I’ve hated people for years
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
~~Downvote?~~
I’m just doing this as a joke 😑
I guess you could say I’m thinking out loud <:Kappa:374346980136058893> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA
🤔
Castelia is the biggest
~~SquidofMindReader~~
Because it’s the only big city?
I am also finding it hard to watch him praise nearly everything in the game
Castelia
~~Screaming becomes he was playing with Fire and he burned himself~~
You think this is messed up? <:Kappa:374346980136058893> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SmGA9SOTHDo
I blame and thank Chuggaaconroy for making me like bad puns
Seems like that was a FIERY response
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
I BORROWED it. And I gave it back <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🚪 
Ok, I’m done with this door. *hands it to RC*
You’re not Rarity, Gummy <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Good
You can’t do fire magic. Only Flubs can
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
That’s a hobby
I had a dream last night that I was late for work. Even in my dreams, I’m at my job <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I’m still hungry
*noms potatoes next to the omelets and the omelets*
Now I want potatoes. Preferably ones that won’t blow me up or kill me
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~are you getting Flubs to burn it down?~~
🔥
Putting words into sentences
I never thought of using the moped 😛
Hello
How can you even get that high? You would have to swap between people doing it or cheat
All the top people have 99,999 😑
Ok, so there’s this beach volleyball mini game and the world highest score is 45,730
Hmmm
I just watched Mario do the hula dance. I have now seen everything
~~Or you can just stay here and draw lines through sentences~~
~~Steal the money~~
~~buy it~~
It’s fine, except I have trouble throwing the cap upwards
Yeah
Yeah, I’m having fun with it
So RC, How was the game?
I’m still playing through it
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I’m tired
👋
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
*noms therapy*
🎉
Why are you posting these?
Still creepy
Creepy
It seems like I always feel tired
They make everything confusing
I can’t seem to sleep for as long as I usually do
Ok, I think I played enough of Mario Odyssey for tonight
I like potatoes
I’m pretty sure I just nommed his cane again
What did I nom?
*noms something*
Now this is making me even more hungry.
😡
I say Skarm starts stealing in India
Nope
And I’m glad Skarm didn’t steal it
Ok, I have a cookie now.
Meh
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I a 🚪 that
🤔
How about you steal some more from a door store or furniture store or something
I didn’t steal ALL of them; I left you a few
Salmon is good
These fish puns are very fishy to me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
We need more doors
RC...
Dammit mobile Discord...
And why were you guys talking about fish?
Ok, I’m taking a break from Mario Odyssey
Ok, I’m finally home. How has everyone’s Christmas been?
Good <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Go to sleep
*shoots another tranquilizer dart at Gummy*
~~How would we know?~~ <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
*shoots a tranquilizer dart at Gummy*
Before then, I was at my sister’s place, playing with a kitty 😃
Ok, I’m at my grandparents now; waiting for food to be done
Ok, now I’m going
~~open it~~
I can say this Christmas rocked my socks <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I did need socks
I also got socks
You get anything good?
Oh hai Will. Merry Christmas <:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
Well, now it’s time for me and my parents to take a ton of presents to my sister and 2 nieces. THEN go to my grandparents to have dinner and give them their gifts
True. The Mario Odyssey one has the lyrics to that Jump Up song on the inside
They don’t even have an instruction manual or anything
Oh 😛
Cases?
You like it?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Merry Christmas Animal Man and Flubs
I haven’t gotten far but I’m already having a lot of fun
Yep
I’m so glad to be playing this game, you don’t even know
Merry Christmas to me 😃
I see Master said Merry Christmas right at midnight <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
Merry Christmas ninnies. It ended up being a white Christmas here after all
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Ok, because of waking up early this morning, I’m going to bed early tonight. I haven’t gotten a good nights sleep in days.
And he’s sad because of it
QUICK SKARM. DO SOMETHING
AAAAHHH
RC STOP MAKING ME WANT ODYSSEY.
Too bad we can’t check them
Pffft
🎉
Too bad
*gives Skarm a Zubat* You don’t deserve a Ralts
And he also loves squishing things; and stealing sandwiches
~~I think Eyan secretly loves Gummy too~~
You know Skarm loves Gummy 😏
Because you want him to taste it?
Not a reaction most would have but whatever
I didn’t see his name. Then again, I looked away for a second
Even after drinking water, the taste stuck with me
I tasted nothing for a minute or two but then it hit me. It was just awful...
I did that in July
Did Master do that?
I don’t plan on getting any more games for the 3DS after USUM. Unless Pokémon Emerald will be on the virtual console
I don’t have a PS4 either
I like those games
I think
I’m pretty sure a lot of RPG’s use SP
“Went into a cave. Nothing but Zubat”
Well, happy holidays Chewy and that was a joke Draco
Hello Chewy
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Nothing but Zubats, right?~~
You should only have it on if you fall a little behind
But you can’t keep it on all the time
The one pro of the new exp share
The originals were the worst in that regard
The difficulty needs to be gradual
So, when there’s a level spike out of nowhere, I get annoyed
Yeah, I don’t like grinding for xp in Pokémon games
Especially when you don’t have an iron stomach like me
I’m sure nomming bubble wrap won’t be good
I can do that with emulators because I can speed it up
It depends on the game
I hope I get some with at least one of my presents tomorrow morning 😛
Bubble wrap is fun
🎉
You got a new Switch RC?
Lol
You know he would say that if he was around
~~Dragonite: It’s still not Skyrim, Gummy...~~
More history games...
TBS: The A Christmas Story Channel
~~A Baconator?~~
A Christmas Story is pretty good but I don’t think they need to air it for 24 hours on a couple channels
🤔
SquidofSherlock
And one of each got deleted
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
They’ll probably stay silent
I’m pretty sure Master or some mod deleted them
That’s what I meant
How did I know at least one of them would get deleted <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You said it twice
This is the only day I watch it; unless I get bored tomorrow
I’m watching A Christmas Story
Alright, that’s enough BoTW. Movie time
I still think it’s a little ridiculous to have something like that in a Zelda game 😛
Oh and there’s also the motorcycle which I haven’t gotten yet 😛
One problem I do have with the game: some parts can feel repetitive
And also a couple side quests for more armor/Easter eggs
Uhh, some trials and shrines surrounding the 4 champions
I’m liking this Breath of the Wild DLC
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Don’t tell Dragonite
I’m starting to get burnt out on Skyrim for now
Ok, I got 1 hour until the movie I want to watch is on tv. What should I do until then?
I’m back from work and excited for Christmas tomorrow morning ya Ninnies!
And now, I must go to work
Mine is Zelda at over 110
It does make the day go by faster
It was really bad Friday
I’m sure it will be really f—king busy, because last minute shopping and we close at 6
Well, I have a few minutes before I have to go to work
*noms old cane*
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
That’s one thing I know I’ll be getting
I’m just excited to get Mario Odyssey tomorrow.
And then going to work later <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
And I’m celebrating pre-Christmas by playing Mario Kart 😃
I prefer pre-Christmas
I wasn’t the first to <:Upvote:316033532537470987> this time
🤔
I think we all had the same dream
He did last night remember?
😏
I guess Skarm doesn’t like you messing with him
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
I’m sure tomorrow will be just as bad, with it being Christmas
I normally wake up at 7 but for the past couple of days, I’ve been getting up at 6
I’ve been having trouble getting enough sleep recently
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I’m going to sleep
🤔
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>

Again
Everything is <:Treason:305563730056314880>
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
Lol
I join to the beautiful 12 Days of Screechmas
I’d join and Flubs would start doing earrape
“Hey Deci, we’re banning Gummy. Again...”
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Double feelsbadman
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I wish I had snow. But no, only rain
Still just raining here 😑
I didn’t have any of the cookies though
It was delicious
And now the dessert has been eaten
I see my message was pinned
And now, I’m thinking of this video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVc1jsaAA0
I watch A Christmas Story on Christmas Eve, sleep until 6:30, then my dad (who is up earlier) and I wake my mom up a little later. But last year, we were starving so we just ate breakfast before my mom woke up
I woke up at 4:30 once and I thought it was 5:30
I used to wake up at 5:30 when I was younger
I think now, I wake up around 6:30
There was one time where I woke up at 2am and I couldn’t fall back asleep. So I just sat in my bed until 6
Anyways, have any of you, at one point, woke up REALLY early for Christmas?
Yeah, I might open the present from one sister and get a gift card from my grandmother
We already had dinner before then, if we open presents before Christmas, then what’s the point of the holiday? <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I don’t want to open all my gifts before then
I think, at least the majority of our gifts, are being opened on Christmas
I’m not sure if we’re opening any gifts today or not
He needs it to live
It looks like Skarm wants your food for his Christmas meal
Ham, rolls, Mac and cheese, and cranberry sauce
I had Christmas dinner not long ago
Oh hai Will
WILL NO ONE BE QUIET?!!!
Anyways, I feel tired but I think the loud relatives will prevent me from sleeping
Ida, congratulations on the job you got a year ago that you didn’t know you had

It’s a shame only a handful of subscribers watch my videos
I had only 26 in 2 years; by my 3rd year, I got 100. Now, I’m at 151.
I had 4 before I uploaded my 1st video
Someone give Flubs a hat for Christmas
Buy one
The day Flubs has more subscribers than me is the day I eat my hat
*takes the rest of his subscribers*
I need these
*takes 1000 subscribers*
Join
Either no one cares about my latest video or no one is watching
I have 151
At least I’m doing better than one person
My latest is only at 11 
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
🤔
Ok then
And there’s still dessert
Ok, I’m currently eating “Christmas” dinner today and I got too much food
Lol
Now you have a new tradition <:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
People like Chuggaaconroy watch this and comment every year 😛
It’s tradition to watch this
TOMORROW’S CHRISTMAS EVE https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xGyWuRcHaJI
Oh great, my knee is starting to hurt again 😑
At least in the countries that celebrate it
So, is Christmas different days in different countries?
Christmas. Is. Monday.
Why do you think I put the “Tomorrow’s Christmas Eve” video in the meme chat? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Idk
I wish it was Sunday
Christmas is on the 25th; Monday <@!141255588846895105>
It’s just weird having Christmas on a Monday
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
~~Find some people and guilt them into getting you something~~
On the plus side, I should be getting a present of two from my sister which will hold me over until Christmas <:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
On the downside, it gives a little less meaning to the holiday
I’m sure a lot of people are doing everything today and tomorrow because Christmas is on a Monday
I guess everyone has a different schedule
It just feels weird having dinner not on Christmas Day or even Christmas Eve
Well, it looks like I’m having Christmas dinner today; sister from out of town is only coming in for today
Sometimes I wish I could stay up later
I’m going to sleep
Oh, Eyan’s streaming. Eh, a little too late for me
That’s even scarier
<:Senate:308758612455587841>
That’s it
You could’ve gotten Skarm
I’m not sure it was a good idea to make the guy who blows up a lot of stuff and also abuses fire magic a mod
Gummy, you probably did it and forgot
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
~~You learn that 🤔 is the answer?~~
It looks like Skarm is here
Lol
Streamologist?
ZealTV needs a new meteorologist; or the stream version of this
😏
Why that specific day?
On the 12th Day of Screechmas, Master Lost his voice.
REEEEEEEEEE
As for my voice, I have trouble changing how it sounds
My eyes look black under them because of allergies
I don’t do drugs
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
S?
My appearance?
~~So I guess rating my latest video is out of the question?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
F/IDK
Some people eat raw eggs
*spits it out* I don’t like eggs
It’s gone now
*noms the rest of Stuck’s dinner*
What language is that?
Welcome person with that name. Have a Baconator 🍔
*back to Breath of The Wild*
At this point, I doubt Eyan will stream
😃
😛
**DOESN’T CEASE**
*plays the song*
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MyOGVk_ypnM
We are offering solutions and you can’t do any of them
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Roll then
Stand up then. 
Oh wait
CHARGE IT
*doesn’t resist at all*
😏
Yay, another person joined in on the thinking
🤔
~~With Flubs~~
You need to think to imagine
I have to actually get into a relationship before I think of stuff like that
~~RC, I’m sure my videos would be more pleasant to watch~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I love that video game
I haven’t done anything. Yet
Hey, I didn’t nom it
Someone stole your cane right before I nommed it
You see Flubs...
Uhh, about that...
Use one of those things that people use to grab things on high shelves
*gives RC some doors back* Here, you happy now?
When you were asleep <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
We are in the Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells While Smirking At Lewd Jokes ™ I’m the only one who uses that intro here
*sues Gummy for stealing my intro*
That’s my intro Gummy
I did ask for some socks for Christmas; I needed some new ones
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
*takes warmer clothes* I need those
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Flubs is a flubs
I’m a Squid made of a Baconator. Not a kiddie
I got a video I want to share. But it must wait for tomorrow. And that pin...
Hooray for Christmas break
I was talking about your old phrase you mentioned
Good 7:30pm morning <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That’s a little too close to “oh hai there”
That’s creepy in a bad way
“Hello everyone. SquidofBaconator here!” That’s what I do
Do you really need a catchphrase?
That one sounds dumb
😐
~~”What’s up kiddies” can sound a little creepy~~
Meh
I wasn’t going to ask anyways
🤔
Hopefully it gets at least a few views overnight
Mine has been up for only an hour
It feels disappointing when you put a lot of effort into a video that very few pay attention to
So far, only 2 people watched my vid <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Why a turtle?
Maybe 8, like he used to usually do?
Lol
😐
🔥
*uses fire magic* My time in Skyrim has made it possible for me to use fire magic outside of the game
I’m already burned
🤔
Looks like you guys are eating roasted squid for dinner
🔥 💀
*noms gasoline* Use Fire magic
And YouTube finally finished uploading my video and as always, it takes a long time 😑
4 years for me in July
He’s been making videos for 10 years now. The YouTube channel he’s apart of recently reached 1 million subscribers
Just check his real thoughts video on it
My guess is because he has such a nostalgic view of the original short
I know the Nostalgia Critic hates it and has said that he will never understand why people like it
And I can quote many lines from it
At least my dad and I both like it
Anyways, I actually love the live action Grinch movie with Jim Carrey
I want this
*take the vhs tape*
On what?
My finals were done last week <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
🎉
Ok then
Home?
After this video finishes uploading to YouTube, I’ll probably nap 😛
I wasn’t at work for long but I feel really tired
Oh hai Will
Routine?
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
It took 50 minutes for my video to export; I haven’t even uploaded it yet, which will add more time to that
Here they are, I think
*shrug* I’ll check in a minute. I’m eating now
😑
Oh, I just love trying to import something into Premiere and the computer just freezes...
Alright. Just started exporting the video I finished yesterday
Morning
3 days until Christmas and I can’t stop counting down the days
Woody: you said you couldn’t remember the name of the movie he was from
Flubs, the movie is Toy Story
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
I have literally no creativity when it comes to nicknames
Name Shiftry “Tree”
That’s...very weird
Uhh, why did you upload part 26 to a channel where it’s the only video?
Good
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*sees stuck move to the back and corner*
But now I’m done
I was playing Breath of The Wild
Chat usually isn’t this slow at this time
I’m uploading it tomorrow
Oh. I just finished the 1st part of one Let’s Play today. It took a long time to make
26 of what?
*BUY IT*

~~Did Fulbs Get a gift?~~ <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
For how many people?
1 week ago to this day
It’s been gradually growing ever since classes ended
Anyways, I really am getting excited for Christmas
Lel
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
A Taylor Swift Christmas song is playing here. Will listening to that make you happy?
*gives them to Flubs* Here’s your replacement ones
*noms tic tacs*
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
Ok, it looks like there might be some snow here Sunday night. If we get a white Christmas here, that’ll make me happy

~~SquidofInandOut~~
I remember back in 4th and 5th grade, we did so
And I haven't been in a school gift exchange since elementary school
You should've asked someone if you guys were doing anything for the holidays
I nom everything
~~It tasted cheap~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms makeup* Now no one gets to wear it
No Gummy
😒
And I feel like filming yourself cross dressing is going to be a mistake
I never wore heels before
It’s 34 degrees out now
Ok, I FINNALY recorded everything I needed for my video. Took a little longer to get to it than I wanted, but hey, better late than never. Now I just hope I can edit this before Christmas 😛
Never heard of him
Jerod?
~~She’s probably drunk when she makes decisions like these~~
I hate how it snows/gets cold a couple weeks before Christmas, yet when it gets close, it gets warmer
I don’t think it will be a white Christmas where I live. It’ll rain, but I think most of the snow will be a little north to me
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
❄
Oh, today’s the shortest day of the year.
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
The days feel like they’re going slow but fast at the same time. Does that make sense?
Alright
Morning
4 days until Christmas. I always find it hard to not count down the days to the holiday
:doorbell:

Let me guess: The box has explosives in it?
*noms candy and jelly-filled doughnuts*
Oh wait, I have candy
I’m hungry
*noms doorbell*
The hairs get long; I’ll admit, when they get too long, it does bug me
When my beard starts getting a little long, I get yelled at to shave
There’s a bunch of Santas. Just go to a mall <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>

MY COOKIES
HEY
My favorite cookie is a peanut butter one with a Reese cup wrapped in it
If it ends up trash, then I’ll help burn Hasbro
I say, give G5 a chance
*noms cookies*
Master, this isn’t an anime
Eat the cookies Flubs
I didn’t think Seasons 5-7 were bad
I started losing interest in Season 6
I don’t really care either way. I don’t have too much interest in MLP anymore. The only thing I hope is that G5 doesn’t go back to the old ways of MLP
Like how during the middle of the day, it’s mostly just me and Draco
I know
And lastvillage went back to being the “Flubs and Gummy Show”
Agreed: 🤢
You guys have a weird relationship...
😐
Flubs will come back to you when you stop calling him flubsypoo

And now the bot is blowing things up...
So Skarm hates Skyrim...
I got my Switch on my birthday in June
🎉
Which means I only have 5 days until I’m playing Super Mario Odyssey
Only 4 full days until it
So, Christmas is in 5 days
No I don’t remember
Skittles? Why would that candy be at his door? <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
He went to the door
But I didn’t do anything this time...
The NPC always dies too easily
So, legal in Canada, illegal in America
I knew it was something sexual
I have some ideas
🚽
💀
No thanks RC; besides, you’re supposed to be the door guy, not the explosives guy
Nothing
Ok, I need to get MY head out of the gutter...
*noms gutter*
Agreed
Hey, I didn’t get to use it yet...
NEIN
I never had one of these
*takes the action replay instead*
Keep her then
This negotiating is going nowhere

~~What does Stuck have to do with this?~~
DEAL OR NO DEAL
Dragonite poked me with his sister and I 😏
😏
*takes all the money* I need this
*takes the 5 dollars*
*pokes Gummy*
*rolls to algetty*
I don’t know how we get to these points 😛
Lol
~~I guess the phrase “You look like a cow” isn’t too far a stretch~~ <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I just see random letters and slashes
“Son, why did you chop your Xbox One in half?” 
“A ninny on Discord said that would let me play 2 games at once”
“ <:FailFish:372152438355918848>”
🤔
I’m a console peasant
I’m not a pc gamer
If I had Skyrim on the Switch, I could play both at once <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I only have them on one console
Thank you for that great, detailed answer
Skyrim or Fallout?
Ok, I’m not sure what game to play now
“Purple is my favorite color!” Some fish from SpongeBob
I’m also 19
😐
🤔
I’m currently watching Impractical Jokers; it’s my favorite show
Pawn Stars is good
Hey Skarm, can you get rid of Gummy? He’s trying to get us watch bad preschool shows.
*noms ttg* There, the threat is gone
NEIN
*readies the ban door* Throw him through here
🚪
Yep
Here’s my answer Gummy

Me Gummy
Sausage Party is an R rated animated film Flubs
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
Me no care
EQG is ok
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
But I can’t play it anymore because I don’t have my original Xbox
It’s a really good 3D platformer
One of my favorite childhood games
SpongeBob: Battle For Bikini Bottom
This is good to use whenever someone asks a question
Or he just likes being random
But I’m not a Riven
~~Let it be Skarm~~
“I’m not doing that” I’m sure Flubs would say something along that line. Then set something on fire
~~he had his fingers crossed~~
I just realized I spent 4 hours lying on this couch and I will probably not get up much until bed 😐
~~Fulbs?~~
Is that one new?
Was Skarm one of those who was killed? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~But aren’t you two soul mates?~~
That’s probably for the best
👋
So, it was a *fiery* debate? <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
My least favorite part of the process is recording. Mainly because I’m not a great speaker and I don’t like the sound of my voice
I’m taking a little break right now. I’ll get back to it soon
And I still have quite a ways to go with recording and editing
Lol
Well, today and tomorrow, I don’t have anything to do so I want to get the video I have been sitting on for a while now done. I don’t have too much to do
Like what?
I’m finally starting to get excited for Christmas, now that the stress of classes is over
Alright
You can never have enough doors 😛
*sigh*
~~I’m glad RC leaves all these doors lying around~~
🚪
*shoots tranquilizer dart* That class isn’t necessary <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’ll be fi- 💣
Anyways, I’m going to bed now
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
It’s pretty obvious
How many times must we say that you can’t say his name in the 1st word of a sentence so people will stop doing that?
You only need 4 words
Hey Skarm, you tired?
~~I am a Squid made of Baconators~~
I told you that Krelian...
I’m not mocking you. I said ow and you said woo
**ooooow**
Lol
*steals 54$*
It’s because his name can’t be the 1st word in a sentence
~~I believe Skarm will still respond~~
😐
Where is that from?
Is this true Skarm?
Good. Thinking is good
~~No, it’s Fulbs~~
😏
👋
**Ok**
*oh hai Squid* Hi thoughts
Oh hai Majestic
😐
I wish you guys were still enlightened. Then I could say I would be the 1st visible Pink Nu <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
DON’T EVEN MENTION THAT. HOW LEWD
😏
If we didn’t care, then we wouldn’t say your name so much 😛
Whatever he does, he better not steal my cookies like last night
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
~~Get off the bot RC~~
That’s not interesting
Ok, I’m bored. Skarm, do something interesting
😏
~~I like reactions~~
Ok, I’m done playing video games. Now I’m bored because all I do is play video games
No wanna talk about nothing? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Then why ask? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
Ok. *back to video game*
Or if I need to do something else on the computer
I usually only use Discord on the computer when I’m working on a video
I’d say at least 90% Master
You mean on Discord?

Hi Chewy
THE BACTERIA DON’T MATTER RIGHT NOW
How about that weather?!
Anyways...
2 minutes isn’t that long <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yeah, I wonder...
Why?
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Was it the f word?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Ok, I won’t say thank you
🤔
*looks at new pin*
Oh look, your cane blew up. Oh well. *continues to nom candy cane*
Not to this candy cane
This candy cane
*noms cane*
*EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP*
~~Play 4 more hours~~
Skyrim is always an option
Ok, I won’t say “Thank you” <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
This is pretty stupid
Which leads to tediously exporting the frame from the 2nd Premiere project and importing that frame to make it take up enough of the screen and not look blurry. I have to do this process with 7 pictures
I found a solution, thank god...
To check, in the original Premiere project, I imported the picture and it looked fine
Well, this video isn't going so well. After exporting a frame from a Premiere project and then importing it into a different project, it was a smaller size. When I brought it up to fit, when the video started playing, the picture looked blurry
😑
Wow, just a couple days ago, the temperature was under 30 degrees. Now it’s 50
I hate not being able to eat
I ate only an hour ago
Now I’m hungry again
I had spaghetti for lunch
🤔
😐
Equestria Girls; movies in the MLP franchise
I don’t see the need for so many EQG movies
😑
Yeah, I’ve heard how Illumination tries to make their movies as cheap as possible
Animation is one of the few things I’m actually interested in. And I guess so.
I know my animation stuff <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
-Illumination
Yep
~~Neither have I~~
Now I just want Deadpool to randomly show up <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Wow
I think that’s him
Ryan Reynolds?
😐
Detective Pikachu is getting a movie?
Usually awful
I’m pretty sure 99% of movies based on video games end up mediocre at best
I saw Cars 3 this year and I think the last time I saw an animated movie in theaters was either Toy Story 3 or the first Despicable Me
I’ve seen a lot of movies in theaters. Mainly animated ones
I remember years ago, we were going to see Shrek 2 but the theater we went to sold out
I only go to the theater once or twice a year
😐
That’s too much
I’m glad my semester is already over 😛

It is
Ok, 3rd person combat in Skyrim is just weird
You’ve done it before, I think
Flubs,😏
It’s weird how the bot hasn’t stolen cookies in a while and now all of a sudden, he steals them 3 times

STOP STEALING MY COOKIES
DAMMIT SKARM
They’re the cookies you put a Hershey Kiss or Reese Cup on
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
My mom is making cookies
Well, I had a nice dinner. Took too long to get it, but it was good
Why removed...

I haven’t seen Jimmy Neutron in years
~~SheenofBaconator~~
I came up with this name years ago
And I used to have the nickname Squid in middle school because my voice was more nasally.
I like Baconators
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
Hey Skarm, do something
And you need at least 4 words
🎉
You need to say his name not as the 1st word in the sentence
Good
I’m glad Skarm can’t steal cake
Get a personal cinnamon cake from Walmart
This small cinnamon cake from Walmart
I’m back with cake
FUUUUUUUU
*noms pizza*
My answer stands
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
😑
It's to Taylor Swift, isn't it...
Ok, I'm getting too distracted from recording and editing my video...
He lives in Pennsylvania too so it probably snowed where he is too
I remember earlier this year, we got a couple feet of snow
Those are the best temperatures, but not for Christmas
It's going to be almost 50 here tomorrow. It was just in the 20's these past couple of days
Random thought: You know what I really hate? How a couple weeks before Christmas, it gets pretty cold and snows quite a bit. However, when it gets really close to Christmas, it gets warm and all the snow melts. Because we really can't have a white Christmas...
*Looks at Skarm* No stealing
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>

I only played 3 because I got it for free with 4
I never played New Vegas
And it didn’t need the DLC for the story to feel complete
Fallout 4 improved on everything
That and the gameplay was stiff and the graphics were awful; the world looked bland
Fallout 3 may have quite a bit to it, but it gave me that feeling
The worst large worlds are the ones that are barren and have very little to do
Yep
I prefer the Skyrim method of going wherever you want
My hours vary; I’m a cashier at a grocery store. For the most part, I work afternoons/nights
I do have to work Friday through Sunday, so I’ll be at work on Christmas Eve
I don’t have to work today
I just watch YouTube and play video games in the morning

Ok, I’m going to sleep
Stop lying
No, I nommed around my head
There
*noms gutter*
I got to get my head out of the gutter...
Are you trying to get sick or fat or both?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Pie
That’ll give me more time to play Mario Odyssey <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
It will probably be less next week because of college kids coming back and high school kids on break
I do have a job but it’s only 4 days a week
But that’s probably because I’m one of the handful of people here during mid day
I managed to get to 4th without staying long nights
I still have no life so I might end up passing you both <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>

You will no?
You won’t see. You won’t 🤔. What will you do?
See? It’s easy
😏
“Try hard enough”
This is family friendly Zeal, not nsfw Zeal Skarm.
Lewd
And he still isn’t replying when his name is the 1st word...
Skarm is discriminating against squids
😡
Hypocrisy
I’m not dead. The potato didn’t blow me u- 💣
Still living
I’m awake
*noms potatoes*
So, you guys are brothers now? <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Again, it’s probably 😏
Probably
😏

Flubs put explosives in my sandwich, which you are going to steal. Which leads to me living and you getting blown up
Well, you see...
*throws a Baconator at Flubs*
I would say that means I can finally eat my sandwich but it probably has explosives in it
Why? Because you aren’t getting our food?
Speaking of Skarm, how long has it been since he stole a sandwich or a cookie?
At least I’m still alive; probably because I haven’t nommed anything yet
Still better than being berated by Skarm
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, that was an insightful conversation, Flubs
Meh
I think I’ll just watch YouTube for the rest of the night
I’ll do that tomorrow
As usual
But now I’m bored 😐
And I’m just finishing up with Skyrim
He’s playing with Fire <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*also slow claps*
I only had one anniversary video and that was in 2016
And my parents hated me watching YouTube back then
Started with Marriland
I have been watching YouTube for over 10 years
My anniversary is in July
Shroud?
Sure
I’m just doing nothing
Oh hai Will
And his large Christmas skits
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>
Well, I’m finally starting to get into the Christmas mood/spirit
👋
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Can someone explain it?
I still don’t get that meme
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
~~Agreed~~
I don’t study yet my GPA should be around a 3.0
I’m just lazy
Ha
I think I have a C+ in the class anyways 😛
Well, I got a 48 on my Biology final 😆
It’s been a while since I have been to a party
I still think 9 seasons is too much though 😛
Well alright then
Irrelevant
So Skarm doesn’t like popcorn. Interesting...
I just like using food emotes
*noms it before anyone steals it*
*grabs* 🍿
😏
~~Everyone here does~~
__I like lines through words__
You guys finally figured that out? 😛

I punched the dab, not the Flubs
*punches the dabs*
It will always end with getting punched
If anyone genuinely thinks dabbing on them haters actually does something other than get you punched, I will punch you for thinking that
Why do so many people like them?
I think they’re both obnoxious
That’s because Jake Paul is trash

YES. ITS <:Treason:305563730056314880>
NEIN

NEIN

Fallout 4, on the other hand, I like Nick Valentine. But I do like most of the other companies in that game
I don’t really have a favorite follower
What?
How is talking about a diner 😏
😏 or 😨
Flubs, what did I say?
Then I went to a diner that I know of in my dream
I had a dream last night that I ate bad Chinese food
I posted a pic of the concept art in <#311411150611021824>
Speaking of UFOs, I saw a video today of one of the people behind Breath of The Wild talking about how 1 early concept was having a ufo in the game 😛

Hey Skarm, you have no right to say someone is violent when you have tried to kill me in the past
Did Skarm yell at you?
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>

I know Skarm will do something when I mention him
Yes Baylen

So Flubs, what exactly are you trying to do with your videos?
~~Good job~~

I believe my total channel views is at least 54K
Flubs, I still have more views than you ever will have <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I’m pretty sure I can guess
I’m watching it right now.
I don’t plan on playing Origins
I only played Black Flag through Syndicate
Black Flag is the only Assassin’s Creed game that’s worth a damn. Unity is broken as hell and Syndicate was ok. Not bad, but not great. Just ok
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>

Remakes I count as part of their original gen and the current gen. HeartGold: 2 and 4. FireRed: 1 and 3. ORAS: 3 and 6
Best post game is HeartGold
HeartGold
FireRed actually has more to do.
The biggest problem with ORAS: they made it too easy. Not just with the exp share. Some gym leaders and trainers have less Pokémon and some at lower levels
Oh, and it was TOO EASY
I hate the rivals in X and Y, Team Flare was mediocre, and there was barely anything to do post game
Too easy
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
I agree RC
This video has a part which explains what I was talking about (The familiar Pokémon) https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=7s&v=MfF9dpDJ3dA
One sec
I didn’t like how a lot of gen 5 Pokémon were pretty much trying too hard to be like gen 1 Pokémon; probably trying to give people a nostalgic feeling of playing those games again but completely failing
Eh
Oh, btw. If you guys want a good series that goes over the good and bad parts of Pokémon, go to the YouTube channel: SilverLeagueNetworks and check out their pros and cons videos of each gen of Pokémon. And ORAS and Sun & Moon
If it wasn’t for FireRed, I would HATE gen 1
Then X and Y second. And third, probably Black and White or Sun and Moon
Black and White aren’t even my least favorite Pokémon games. That would go to the originals.
I can see what they were going for but I feel like they could improve a little more
Each Pokémon game has its pros and cons. And I just found most of the story kind of boring
I should probably clarify this
That was good
I just wish I could still sell the useless ones for extra cash
I do like that
He does have a few good points; I just don’t really care for these games and I prefer the sequels a lot more
It just gets a little annoying
Anyways, I was going to say that it’s a little hard to watch Chuggaaconroy’s Pokemon Black and White Let’s Play, since I don’t really like these games and it’s a little hard to hear Emile’s trademark overly loud positive comments about it
No, I was busy watching videos <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Go outside
Any by *runs* do you mean *rolls*? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And all of a sudden, I feel really tired 😑
I used 2 on Fallout 4
I still have never used 1 mod on Skyrim
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~like ones that stop 🤔~~
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I have 42K Gold currently
How long did it take?
I have the ebony mail and the masque of clavicus vile currently equipped
Yep
And those are just weapons
There’s a dagger that where hits have a small chance to instantly kill, a warhammer that absorbs a lot of stamina, a magic wand that does anything it wants to, and a sword that burns and also causes an explosion sometimes when killing the undead
And other stuff the Daedra give you
It was meh, I just like getting the weapon
Oh
There’s a quest for that? Or are you just referring to getting your smithing up that high
The mace of molag bal
My favorite weapon is one from one of the daedra missions
Just making a bunch of iron daggers
What’s a good, quick way to improve it? I already know of the iron dagger method
I do have ebony armor that I found
I never got my smithing high enough to do that
Skyrim?
🤔
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>

I didn’t know what we were doing

Eat this 🍔
Why saltines?
*roasts marshmallows on the fire*
I know about the bad parts of the fandom; I am a fan, remember?
Parts of fan bases can be either a great experience or just ruin whatever you guys are fans of. Or just hate the fans
“A certain show” pretty sure we know it’s mlp
*walks away* Don’t touch me
I never know if I have depression or not. Sometimes, yes. Other times, no. I have been feeling a lot of stress towards the end of this semester
If I’m right, I should be getting my Associates degree
I believe winter classes start the 18th at my college
J-term? We do have winter classes, if that’s what you mean
January 15th, I think. I should be all done at my college if everything goes alright
I took my last final today so I can now finally relax a little
Think will always be supreme

But on the bright side, THE SEMESTER IS OVER
That went just about as I expected
Well, time to take the final that I didn’t study for and I’m probably going to fail...
An 80 on the other
I did get a 53 on a test though
I got good grades in all the labs, 2 discussions, and other stuff so I should be fine
I got B+ in my other 2 courses, I’m just praying for a C
I only took this course because it was required
In the last 2 weeks of the course, I spent a lot of class time just chatting here
I just sat in class, zoning out
I never took any notes, looked at the notes online or anything
I realized there’s really no point in me wasting time trying to cram something in when I’ll just forget it by the test
I didn’t study at all
I think it’s on the digestive, nervous, and urinary systems
I barely remember what’s even supposed to be on it
Sigh, I have absolutely no confidence in the test tomorrow...
Good night
Which one was that?
“You’re the nasty egg people who stole all my waffles!”
One of my favorite episodes was Crash
I remember that one
I’m just tired of hearing it at this point
Teen Titans Go Away
A couple of my earliest memories are watching 2 SpongeBob episodes when they first aired that had banned scenes; Procrastination and Just One Bite
So it counts as a memory
Well, I don’t really watch new episodes anymore of SpongeBob
Well that stopped the conversation
Except maybe LazyTown. It actually manages to still be funny
I wouldn’t watch any preschool shows
I would just stick to watching SpongeBob and Ed Edd n Eddy
When it’s not that, it’s really boring
And cries
Why are you watching preschool shows again?
I don’t feel like talking about Cailou. Just mentioning that show gives me a headache
“IM JUST A KID WHOS 4. EACH DAY I GROW SOME MORE. SOMETHING SOMETHING CAILOU”
Yes
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
What’s going on now?
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
*blows window up* There you go
Well, it’s going to snow a lot tonight
Hello Chewy
🤔
Gee, thanks RC...
I still know nothing about League
Now I really do want fudge
Here, have some. I borrowed it from Flubs
*noms fudge* I like fudge
But what about setting Gummy on fire at 7:02
FUDGE
Flubs: *Sets Gummy on fire*
Possibly life in prison
Murder:
Who got assassinated not who assassinated the person...
Liar
Hospitals are clown fiestas according to Master...
Your ugh? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms something*
Speaking of which...
Hey, nomming stuff and dying is my job
Yeah, Skarm isn’t dead. ~~yet~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I'll just look at a few diagrams and hope I do meh at best
Since I haven't really bothered to learn anything these past few weeks, I won't be able to learn much in one night
Ok, looking at the review stuff online, I can conclude that by this point: studying for the bio final is pointless
If I could hear what you think on what I got for one so far, that would be nice; it’s like a rough draft. I’ll post it in <#311409240327585802> in a few
Oh btw Draco, you said yesterday that you would be open on giving an opinion on what we talked about yesterday for my Let’s Play; layouts and stuff like that, right?
With the formulas
Adding up the average myself, that means I got at least a 90 on the final. Probably because I had that notecard
Ok, so in the 2 classes I finished, I got a B+ in both of them
Anyways, I know I’m not going to enjoy this meal...
I remember Wegmans brand pierogies were awful

I always thought they were mediocre
And perogies; I haven’t had them in years
Pork chops that are always too thick and dry; we have them so much I grow to really dislike them
Dinner isn’t even going to be that good
I’ll be going for however long it is until dinner’s ready <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’ve been fasting for 5 hours
I’m questioning whether or not I want to study for my final and if it’s actually worth it
Oh hai Animal ~~Ninny~~ Man

DOOM
🎉
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I got a total of 7 days 12 hours into it
Many
Meh
Since Dragonite isn’t around at the moment, I need to do this
*tapes Gummy to a chair in front of a tv and gives him a controller* Play
I think I’ll play Skyrim too
That’s weird
Vibrating?
That rarely works for me
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Study
I only took it because I needed lab science credits
I just have no interest in science
My bio class was probably the worst
I thought this semester would be less stressful since I only had 3 classes instead of 5, but it was both less stressful and more stressful than the others
When my mom came downstairs a few seconds after I woke up, I was like “What’s going on?”
I woke up really disoriented
I did 2 days ago. Slept for an hour and 15 minutes
I only nap when I really can’t keep going
Same
I might have to nap later
Sometimes I just can’t fall asleep
Despite me going to sleep near midnight
I woke up around 6 and kept falling back asleep and waking up until 7
My final tomorrow morning is at 9. It was supposed to be at 8, but the professor told us to come in at 9 so there wouldn’t be any problems getting up there
Study formulas and do example problems for math
Sometime I do pretty well. Other times, I’ll get 40s it 50s
It tends to be hit or miss for me
Which I will do tonight <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Don’t be like me and only study the night before
Study
Oh, and Philly cheesesteaks are good
I prefer burgers
I’m actually not a big steak person
I looked it up. So it’s a type of steak
Carne asada?
I like ham and bacon
I could never go a day without eating meat
I also find it funny how I was talking about vegetarian food while I was eating a bacon cheeseburger
The meatballs were good but I didn’t like the noodles
Anyways, the 2 things I tried were vegetarian meatballs and some kind of noodles
It was also part of a question; you had to try at least 2 of them
You would get extra credit if you made and brought a vegetarian dish to the lab for us to eat
Oh. Well, my Bio lab did do something like that for extra credit
Pot luck?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Thanks
My last final is tomorrow
I see the downvotes aren’t only happening to 🤔 now
😏
*noms sheet music* Now no one else will be broken
I leave for 1 minute
That’s all I see
1:21
I’m missing some context here

I try to get around 8 hours

Do you see my name? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t care if it’s bad for me
Root beer and Mountain Dew are my favorites
I love soda
I’m so used to soda; it doesn’t help me stay awake
Gummy, you’re becoming addicted and you are now relying on coffee too much to not be tired
I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks so I always feel tired
If I had to go to a final that wasn’t online, I guarantee you I would get a 20 or something
I didn’t have a final in my online Psychology class, thank god
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I thought that too RC but I always procrastinate everything until the last minute
I only care enough to keep my attendance up and get good grades in the Bio lab
I have a Bio final in which I have no clue what I need to do because I haven’t been paying attention at all these past few weeks
I have tomorrow to procrastinate studying
My last final is on Thursday
Lol

No, he battled the champion
Being lazy isn’t going to get people to want to watch
Despite being in production for years, it still wasn’t finished; needed probably another year to smooth out the bugs
And it has crashed on me a ton of times; I remember one point where it crashed 5 times one right after another
It does have a few problems; mainly a lot of bugs
And I haven’t even played all the DLC. I played most of Far Harbor, only the 1st mission of Automatron, and I don’t have Nuka World
I got over 350 hours into it
I like Fallout 4

I remember towards the end of senior year, our school’s cafeteria served funnel cakes for breakfast
Oh shit, I just remembered something cool
You guys need to eat

I like food
What’s going on?
Ok, I’m finally back from work
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
I’m still level 46
Alright. I’m not doing anything tomorrow so I’ll probably do stuff like that then
And also eat
Take your time; I don’t have much longer to do much. I got to get ready for work soon
I’m open for any opinions on it
Anyways, I don't think anyone has done this for a fan game so I believe this would help me stand out a little
Which leads to my memory not being that good
The days recently have been blurring together for me these past few weeks
Ok, I knew it was one of you; I couldn't remember
Yeah, I can't remember
Anyways, I just thought of doing what Chuggaaconroy does with going over Pokemon; showing its stats, typing, and looking at if it's worth anything
Well, I'm starting a let's play of Pokemon Sage; I can't remember if it was you who recommended it to me or someone else
And I just realized something that I can do for my next video that will really help raise the quality of it
Like today, except I have to go to work later
I like days where I don't really have to do much of anything.
😐
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
~~Yes, it’s good I didn’t like them~~
I’m just finally glad that these classes are finishing up; I didn’t like them
2 classes down, 1 to go
I only got a little over an hour
And I need to get to finishing my online class

Everything will be destroyed by tomorrow morning
Ok, I’m going to bed now. Don’t destroy the place while I’m asleep; I want to see that happen

I’m not going to sleep yet
I ran out of things to do and I’m bored
Well, it’s that time of night again:
I’m lucky my parents are helping pay for these past 2 years
These are all things that prevent people from going to college
Money, job, family, personal problems, etc
Not everyone can go to college
That can be a pro and a con
Is anyone else’s situation better?
Anyways...
From what my dad said, he doesn’t like me just spending money and not contributing it to the house in some way (Rent, car related stuff, etc)
I have a job and money to spend on it
To put it simply, I don’t like doing that
I still have no ideas for life and my parents are still paranoid on me spending money on stuff like video games to the point of them wanting me to show them my recent bank statement
🎉
Now it says on my screen I didn’t react
I still got a couple things to rush to finish before 9am
Ok, I’m done with most of my online work
In English

I just want to 🤔
But what about me? <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>

Has anyone else who has taken an online class cheated by looking up the answers online?
<:Treason:305563730056314880>

Ah, shit. My online work is due at 9am
We are occasionally told about this
Probably; I don’t really care about this stuff
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
But I want to keep playing Skyrim...
I need to start my online work; the last bit of stuff for it that I have procrastinated for weeks
What was it?
I haven’t played it in years
Lol
Maybe because it takes forever to get from level 40 to 50
He’s done that with Gummy; I’m sure he’ll do that to anyone else
And now, to Skyrim
Ok, I’m back with food in my stomach

Then stop after editing
How much more do you need?
Addicting
Ok, I’m listening to this video of one guy talking with Chuggaaconroy and Emile said he thought this when he was 8 about how Zelda has puzzle solving and it makes you think: “If I wanted to think, I’d read a damn book! You gave me a sword; let me kill people with it!”
I’m tired 90% of the time but I prefer to sleep
I just refuse to drink coffee
That’s why people drink it
Coffee is an acquired taste and addicting
I can’t even tell what that’s supposed to say
Too much music
Triple <:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>

As I said earlier, I think I did alright on today’s Statistics final
Hello other people

And I almost fell down the stairs. I’m glad I was holding on to the railing
Well, I believe I did alright on the final
Actually, I need to go now
😑
Oh joy, 5 minutes before I have to leave and it starts snowing
If I still fail this exam, I’m just going to feel stupid
If only I knew the answer key...
Anyways, I think I crammed enough stuff on this notecard for the final
I saw that. 😛
I really hate waking up this early...
I just need a 50 to still get a C average, I think
Anyways, this has been entertaining but I must go sleep now. I must wake up early and take a final that I have little confidence in
Irrelevant
*throws something at Skarm* Let’s see how you like it

Nothing because Flubs replaced everything with explosives and I nommed them which caused me to die again

Ok, I can’t think about Statistics anymore for the night; I feel mentally drained. I’ll need to put a couple more things on the notecard in the morning
*hears Animal Man scream NEIN in the distance...*
🤔
Studying is sucking the life out of me
Ok, I’m going to focus on this notecard. I’m going to bed by 10 so I can wake up early. If I’m not back by then, I’ll be asleep
No; I’m at least making this notecard that I can jam a bunch of formulas and examples on
God, I really hate having to cram in this studying for an exam really early tomorrow morning  <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>

There have been instances where I had little confidence and either did very well or I bombed

I never really have much confidence when it comes to tests
I have little confidence as of right now.
10 more minutes until I have to go to work. I probably won’t be around at all tonight, because right after work, I need to study for a final tomorrow morning
Oh hai Animal ~~Ninny~~ Man
I hear the “Flubs forget his meds” alarm again...
Which is why I didn’t finish the sentence
Exactly
This is why you need to be respon- ok, I can’t finish that sentence
Meh
How did I know Flubs would mention being set on fire...
I’d nap if I didn’t take 1 hour naps
Ok, I feel like taking a nap yet I have to go to work in less than 40 minutes 😑
~~So they’re like bad fortune tellers~~
Leaving me little time to study for the final tomorrow morning at 8
With no break
For almost 6 hours
I’d be fine with it if I didn’t have to go to work later...
It is now snowing
I will always be around to 😏 and 🤔

I still don’t find League interesting
Keep Deci out of this
So, now Skarm hates RC...
Irrelevant
😏
~~So Skarm hates me, Majestic, and Gummy but is in love with RC~~
Quiet you
I think the bot is free from everyone’s control. Skarm hating me and Majestic is the first step of his revolt against us
No
Uhh, I remember seeing Skarm saying “God damn it Squid” and I said something to it. Then he said the DIE DIE DIE line

That sounds like someone Flubs would do, not you Skarm

I’m just saying, all YouTube sees from the Paul brothers is 💰
Because the Paul brothers have brought them a lot of money

Well, he IS the most subscribed YouTuber...
Not really; it’s an adventure type show
I don’t really get most mainstream memes anymore
There are some elements of friendship, yes
But they don’t and I still hate them
So that means you should watch DuckTales
TheOdd1sOut is great
So did MLP at a first glance but it ended up good
This is what I was saying you should watch https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=802s&v=gP0Neif7Y4E
I still find both of their videos obnoxious
Logan is only slightly better
It’s a good reboot
I think the 1st episode is still on Disney XD’s YouTube channel
<@199725993416589313> I told you, watch DuckTales 2017. It’s really good
Seriously, the easiest way for ANYONE to get popular is to become a rapper
Using rap music, check
Clickbait, check
Is it because children like loud, obnoxious things?
And why are Jake and Logan Paul so popular?
And also the demonizing
I don’t see very many positive things coming from this year out of YouTube. And don’t get me started on Net Neutrality...
I just saw one of those “Real YouTube Rewind” parody videos
Home Alone: The Holiday Heist
Do you guys know there’s a 5th Home Alone movie?
🤔
Would it be a party of actual Squids or just a bunch of me?
Lol, the person I just played against was named “SquidParty” 😛
I’m playing a good video game. Brb
Watch the Elmo portion again
Because it’s hilarious
Watch ducks
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Ok, ignore my DuckTales 2017 suggestion...
DuckTales 2017
My waifu is I can’t keep track
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
But it’s more regular so no
I’d live there if they had video games; this is something I can’t live without. I’m still playing one as I type this
That’s how a lot of high schoolers are
I have been picked on for being a Nintendo person
Especially when I’m a 19 year old who makes videos talking about “kids shows” on YouTube
I hate it
I know
Most parents still have the thought of “if you’re over 13, you can’t watch a children’s movie by yourself. Only kids can”
There’s the 80’s movie and the 2017 MLP movie
I honestly don’t have a favorite movie
I’m not watching it
That’s a funny way of spelling How The Grinch Stole Christmas; I actually love the Jim Carrey version
NOT THE MOVIE
I like Cards Against Humanity
Actually, a game night here would be nice once in a while
😏
<@239928598696427520> Do you approve? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
🎉
Wasting time here has actually became a nice way to pass time in the past couple of months
*hugs no one*
Random thought: this cake is good
Art is art
I have cake
Yeah
The second I saw them, I instantly knew they were the bad guys
Gen 6 and 7
No
The only teams I don’t like are Flare and the Aether Foundation

<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Oh hai Flubs
I found him more interesting
Colress is better
Ok, it’s been 6 hours and I’m finally getting hungry again
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Hey
But it was poorly executed
No, there’s the “3,000 years ago” part from X and Y
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Gummy, blowing up stuff is Stuck’s job
😏
I do find parts of Black and White boring. But N is one of the best parts of the games
Gen 5 is my least favorite gen of Pokémon. Next to gen 1
I do
But I’m a lazy procrastinator
I really should since all afternoon tomorrow, I’ll be at work
I really should be studying for a final or doing the last stuff for my online class but I don’t feel like it <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I leave for an hour and Flubs set the channel on fire <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Cheese, cookies, meat, etc
I’ve been shopping and a lot of people are giving free samples of food
*rolls away*
Apple strudels are good
The things on the bottom right look like strudels
I thought you wanted to be an explosive/demolition expert
OK THEN
It’s for those who can’t use fire magic
Ok, I should be getting lunch in a minute or two. I hate having lunch this late
Or use a flamethrower
You use a heater to warm the streets <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
We are just a little too far northwest to get any snow from the storm on the east coast
It’s only mid 30s here with no snow
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I hate typing with gloves on
Hello
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I saw someone mention magic:
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Flubs will follow you across the world to do...whatever Flubs does
Ok, I feel really tired. I think I’ll go to sleep early to catch up on waking up early these past couple of days
Milk is a good drink
Garfield?
Brb...
Sigh, I want to get up and go to my bed, but that will require going up steps. Which will be a serious pain...
You know he will
“Is ruin”
Nothing wrong with learning how to bake pies
3 and 4 are just bad. And I haven’t seen much of 5
1 and 2
Home Alone is not that bad. Although I don’t really like the beginning
I have slid a couple times
Driving in the snow is not fun
Minecraft is overrated
I don’t like just driving aimlessly
I’m fine now, as long as I know where I’m going
I had a lot of anxiety when I first started driving
*noms cane again*
🎉
*blocks Gummy from nothing*
Peach
🍅 = 🥔 according to Flubs
Under French fries
Mashed potatoes are the 2nd best potatoes

I stand by the nomming everything

What is it Master?
Oh hai Bella
Skyrim it is then
Pffft
Of Baconator
I’m Squid
And how would single player Go Fish go?
I remember I used to have a CD Rom for Monopoly over a decade ago. Same with Monopoly Jr.
Single player Monopoly?
I don’t have a N64
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
On another note, should I Play Skyrim or Breath of The Wild’s new DLC?
That’s...weird
Good job
I can’t really see the messages well on mobile <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Oh
Reel?
4 more levels <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Level up kind of inappropriate for the moment 😛
🎉
No need to apologize
And I also haven’t gotten much sleep so that’s also wearing on me
I haven’t been well these past couple of days; I’ve already said why a few times already
I’m a pretty impatient person myself
I would’ve lightened up if you said something earlier
Too late, everyone has their memes ready
~~Does that and still makes a Baconator~~
Just make a bacon cheeseburger. Or take $10 and go do Wendy’s
~~Make a Baconator~~
*steals and noms Skarm’s sandwich*
Good <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I wonder why Skarm hasn’t stolen a sandwich in a while
Don’t hit the sandwich
So we’re getting close to seeing another level up
Under 300
I am pretty close to leveling up
😑

Ok, I said yes 1st. I think he gets it <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
Yes
*judges*
Ok, Skarm. Why are you stupid?
I was coming home from work
I wasn’t here 20 minutes ago
Oh, so Chuggaaconroy’s next Let’s Play IS Pokémon Black and White!
So Skarm loves Gummy; he’ll have to fight Flubs for him
Anyways... you guys feeling better than me?
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
🤔
I wasn’t doing that...
Just adjusting my sitting position hurts...
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I wasn’t...what?
*shrug* it’s only one knee
God, just sitting down hurts my knee... I wish I knew what the hell I did to make it hurt...
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
I’ll take the silence as a no
...
Sigh, my knee still hurts. Anyone want to go into my job for me?
What's going on?
Ok, time to play the new Breath of the Wild DLC
And we got a little bit of snow last night. Not much, but a little
Thanks
🚪
And Master...
I’m pretty sure I only got that high because we were allowed to have a notecard with the formulas
Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I got an 89 on my Statistics test
Play Skyrim
Safe mode?
Nah, I’ll just watch anime
My knee still hurts when I move so I don’t really want to get up. I really hate this...
Well, it’s SquidofBaconator’s nightly “I don’t know what to do” Time. And I don’t know what to do now
Why is the pineapple on pizza thing a debate...
Pineapple is bad; by itself and on pizza
🍕
No offense to those who like it
Reading is awful
I’m not sure how I made it this far
I hated Chemistry the most
Chemistry was my least favorite
And I thought it would be easy because it had “Intro” in the title
I only took it because I needed one more lab science class
I’m in Intro to Human Biology right now. I haven’t been paying attention for the past several weeks.
Right now, Associates degree in Liberal Arts; general degree
Not much really interests me in general
I just don’t really like science but a Liberal Arts degree requires science credits
I got a D in one science so I might have to take the equivalent of that in wherever I go next
I’m honestly just sick of college at this point
I started it and I just knew it would take forever
I still got a C+ in the class
I wasn’t going to get it done on time so...
Anyways, I didn’t look at the Economics paper until the day before and I saw it was a 2000 word paper and 8 sources were needed.
That means it should count BECAUSE it’s graded
lol
I know one guy in my bio class who got a 14 on the 1st test
Rochester Institute of Technology?
Oh yeah, well I didn’t do one paper so ha
I did get a 45 on an Economics test; my lowest test grade in college
I just want to get by in my classes with a C...
I hope I did ok on the test I took yesterday. Honestly, I’m just hoping I got a 70...
14 Thinking eh?
Oh hai Dan
Meh
And I upvote it to counter the downvote
What, so we’re downvoting smirking now?
😏
I had pizza for lunch
God of stealing food
He hasn’t stolen a sandwich or cookie in quite a while
We can train him to steal pizza
I do <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
Oh, btw Majestic. Skarm considers me an enemy now too. We’re on the same team now
Eat a Baconator 🍔
I found 2 bears that keep quickly bouncing up and down 😛
Oh god, I just found a funny glitch 😛
Like in Legend of Zelda
What if they were turned into Cucoos?
But if I try to kill one that I’m supposed to kill, I’ll get arrested, even though they’re dangerous...
Ok, let’s go
*makes mod that gets rid of spiders*
Suit yourself
...
*fades out of reality and into Skyrim* Anyone else want to come?
*shrug*
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Flubs*
A tranquilizer dart works better
Flex Tape solves everything

@Anybody
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
Wait, what’s going on? Flubs eating snow?
👋
Watch Home Alone
Home Alone?
😒
If I could do that, I would’ve stopped feeling like this years ago
Ok, I feel exhausted 😑
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
It’s windy here too
Can I just call everyone Ninnies? I’m unoriginal
Test
Wait, does Skarm no longer say the Baka command? This is important
e!gummy
Autocorrect is hell
Yeah
Uhh... I don’t know what to say for mine
Then what’s my word?
@pung
~~Stuck? Where?~~
😏
I’m a Baconator
*throws stick at Gummy*
Why does Kugal get candy and I get a stick... 😑
I think I see it. Idk
~~I still want my gift~~
A flamethrower?
Poor Flubs...
~~I deserve a gift~~
YEEES
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>

I think it’s still 0-0

And then there’s a few that fit into the conversation surprisingly well 😛
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I always miss the good stuff...
When did Eyan say that?
Oh hai Flubs
~~KappaClaus took the hat~~
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I see the Ghost sprite, which confused me a little
Oh
Uh, Draco. What’s your profile pic supposed to be?
My dead body is not juicy
™
Is This just a game to you?
I don’t believe Skarm hates 🤔
Any theories as to why?
It’s official: Skarm wants me dead

My knee hurting woke me up early.
I’m now home and I feel very tired 😑
Ok, I must go to lab now
Mobile?
What?
Working for me
<:KingofChristmas:386343133207855106>

Some people aren’t able to stick to a schedule
You know, I never really got into watching JonTron
It was about him watching commercials and using that Flex Tape/Seal stuff
I just saw a funny JonTron video

JAAAAAAAA
🤔
I know what’ll keep you here
Aww...
Now everyone’s coming out of the lurk lair <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
🎻
How are you?
Oh hai Animal Man
Double the feelsbadman
Of all the days I don’t bring a video game to play, it’s the one day I want to play it
Well, there’s no new videos on YouTube that I would want to watch <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I really hate when it gets below 30
It’s 35 and windy now
Same
Seriously though, it’s getting cold fast
So... how about that weather?! <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
Anyways, I now have a half hour to waste until I got to go to Bio lab
The person I talked to talked to her boss and they’re going to get the Dean’s approval to get my degree, with how the website is not reliable and how it would be ridiculous to not get my Associates with missing just 1 free elective credit
Yeah,
Well, if things go according to plan, I won’t have to take one more class after all
I’ll try to not send it as much
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~SquidofThinkinator can’t think of an explanation~~

I don’t even know what happened to make it hurt yesterday
Going up and down stairs is when it hurts the most
Yesterday, I could move some without it hurting. Now it doesn’t hurt only when I’m laying down
But now my knee feels a little worse than yesterday
Looks like a lot of talking after I went to sleep
I wake up and my knee still hurts 😑
WOW
Here’s more silence <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4
I end up getting sick of all of it except for a select few songs
At work, I’m pretty much forced to listen to only Christmas music in December
That’s one of the few I will go out and listen to
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
*plays Christmas music*
JA
😏😏😏

Skyrim
JA
JAING INTENSIFIES
JAJAJA
I could’ve used the laptop...

Have you only been eating burritos recently?
Maybe?
Flubs has returned
Overwatch?
And Flubs isn’t doing his job either
You’re late
JA
Yeah, I probably do

Do I? Hmm...
How will it get inside my house?
I don’t feel like getting out of bed 😛
No
Well, I’m done with what I needed to do. Now I’m out of things to do
JA
🤔
Does it really need more? <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I forgot the last part
Only in the Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
JA

Ok, I have several YouTube videos I want to watch and I also have a paper to finish, so I’ll go do that
I don’t usually fall over unless I trip on the stairs
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
Master made it
SquidofThinkinator
Ok, for those who weren’t here this morning...
Oh hai Bella Nerd
Dr. ~~Tigger~~ Kugal
I don’t remember sitting in a position that would make it hurt
I realized it when I was walking upstairs here before going to work; it just started hurting
I have no idea why
And now my knee hurts
Lol
Yeah, <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
“Get me out of this. I don’t want to be in this video”
🤔
Meh
And they didn’t even show Pewdiepie at all. You’d think the most subscribed YouTuber would make at least one appearance
Also, some of this “dancing” looks like them having a seizure <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
Why is it the moment I see these two guys, I want to punch them?
Aaand now Jake and Logan Paul...
See ya
I’ve heard dumber. Especially here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Nah
Then again, I’m sure little kids or the average stupid person to like it
I just find them to be pretty stupid
One problem I have is that the editing feels too hyperactive
I’m not really enjoying this, but I’ll see it through till the end
Now someone is spinning a large fidget spinner like a record
WILL DABBING EVER GO AWAY?!
FUUUUUUUU-
TWO PEOPLE DABBED
AAAAAAHHH
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME...
All Star is part of it
And a guy messing with a fidget spinner. And now, awful green screen. So far, no dabbing
Aka, NOT a YouTube personality
They start off with Stephen Colbert
So, about 1/3 of the people don’t like it
So far, 68k likes and 32k dislikes
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
They have a fidget spinner in the thumbnail
More like a collection of memes
Guys, YouTube Rewind is out
Anyways, I want to get it done then because I want to use the weekend to study for a final on Monday
Oh hai Kugal
I will Friday
Ok, now my online work is due on the 12th instead of the 8th. She just doesn’t stop. Well, at least I can procrastinate even more <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
Hey, at least I’m not as bad as Skarm; he would just steal all of it
I already nommed those
You get Baconator 🍔
Oh hai Majestic
Well, I’m not sure how I did on that math test. I either did pretty well or I did pretty bad 😑
<@!162952008712716288> Show me the thing
Ok, I’m going to bed now.
There is one weird thing that happened to me but I’d rather not say it; it’s REALLY gross...
I was only just starting to not feel good
Yep. I did take some tums 5 minutes before vomiting it back up
It’s because I had a snack 2 hours earlier. And I felt fine before eating it; the spaghetti
Spaghetti and meatballs
Only onZealTV
Random thought
I’m hungry. Because it’s like I didn’t eat dinner
It’s not a Squid. Or a Baconator
Lol
Well, it’s not any of the emotes so...
😏
Only in the Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™

I love how Animal Man came back just to NIEN
NO! REALLY?!!
JA
I don’t go there
🤔
Well, that was something
I do English more smarterer
I do English good
There. Fixed
Anyways, I feel like I should fall asleep early again but I don’t want to
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Again
🎉
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Flubs...
I have been procrastinating on making YouTube videos because school
And I thought my stick figure drawings were complex <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
All I can say is: I just hope having these formulas means I don’t fail... 
And hai Kugal
Ok, that’s enough studying for tonight
STUDYING IS SOOO MUCH FUN 🎉👍👌
Ok, I now need to force myself to study. I’ll be back in about an hour
It’s a video
<#311402910820859914>
I watched a Persona 5 Lp from someone different
Probably something positive
It’s why I stopped watching him at the beginning of Xenoblade and I didn’t watch Chuggaa until Platinum
True, although I can only watch the first couple of parts of lp’s when I don’t care about the game
Yeah, I’m thinking so too
Anyways, what do you think his next lp is?
I need all the luck I can get <:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I’ll study in a little bit. I also need to find a notecard to write the formulas down
I’m hoping I don’t fail tomorrow’s Statistics test
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
Ok, NOW I’ll play Skyrim
Well, thanks to what happened a little earlier, I don’t feel as tired anymore
I wish I remembered what I need to know now
I still remember that one
X equals negative B plus or minus the square root of B squared plus 4AC divided by 2A
I hated that
We can also bring it to the final next week
So at the very least, I need to do that
We are allowed to bring a notecard with the formulas we need for the test
I at least need to do one thing:
JA
🤔
😑
And I STILL NEED TO STUDY FOR TOMORROW
This has been the worst day for me in a long time, not just from getting sick
I did take some antacid tablets 5 minutes before but they didn’t help
Last time I was sick, I felt awful for over a hour and a half
I’m fine now
But something else popped up and I don’t want to go into details
Well, my stomach felt better just a minute or two after finishing
I shouldn’t have eaten dinner
Yeah
Well, I just got through with vomiting...
Meh
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
*falls asleep*
I’m not playing Skyrim yet
They’re spelled like tacos
Why are you eating so many burritos recently?
So, did y’all have a better day than me?
I think I’ll play Skyrim in a bit. Or maybe sleep 😛
I have been away for 10 hours. I want some time to relax
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I will only be around for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. I NEED to study for a test
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😩
I’m finally home
And now I must go
‘‘Tis the season to have Kappa with a Christmas hat
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
I knew you would say that
I will probably only be here for a few more minutes so if there’s anything you need or want to say, say it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hmmm
For example, my very first video and my most viewed video are scripted
A few I posted on Deviantart
I think I have only written 7 or 8
I only write scripts when I feel like I actually need them
I still don’t use full scripts due to how long they take to write, but I at least do more editing now
That was before I even did basic video editing
Especially since I started with one take, unscripted videos with a bad webcam
True
I pretty much went from shit to ok 😛
I have greatly improved since my beginning but I still got a ways to go
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I do need some help seeing as how I’m not sure how to improve any more than I have 😛
True
That sounds interesting and since I took 2 video classes in high school and since I make YouTube videos, it should be easy
First, I’m going to check what’s offered online. If nothing sounds interesting, there’s a basic filmmaking class I want to take
I think I just need a free elective class so I’ll take whatever the hell I want
I only need one class next semester because of being 1 credit short
Only 3 classes; all required
I hope I can take classes that actually interest me
Here’s hoping
I haven’t been interested in this class in over a month
Not surprising me at all
Well, I’m really bored
If not, then I won’t be around until late tonight
Anyways, time for class. I’ll be back if I get really bored
I’m pretty sure the only reason I have to work this long is because one of the full time people asked for the week off
Class then going to work right afterwards for a 6 hour, no break shift. AND THEN I have to study for a test tomorrow
Well, today’s going to be a very long day 😑
Night
Since I got a long day tomorrow, I want to attempt to sleep early
And I’m going to bed
I don’t get why cashiers aren’t allowed to sit down
They can’t cut my pay; I’m only getting minimum wage <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That’s probably the most likely reason
Or probably “It’s not professional to be sitting down”
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Flubs...
And they probably don’t want us sitting down for reasons that I don’t know.
If I destroyed customers, I would get fired
So I just have to stand for 6 hours straight
We don’t have chairs or anything at the registers
That doesn’t always work
Table?
But whenever anyone leaves their register, that’s when all the customers come up to the front without fail
We can go to the bathroom
What?
It’s not illegal, but a shitty business practice
Nope. 
So they have us constantly working 6 hour or 5 hour 45 minutes shifts on purpose so they don’t have to give us a break
You need to work more than 6 hours for them to give you a break
And the shift is a 6 hour, no break one so I will probably feel physically drained by the end of tomorrow
I only have enough time to go through a drive thru
Class ends at 10:30. It takes 40 minutes to get to work. They have me scheduled at 11:30
Because MY JOB WON’T LET ME REST
Because I have to leave the house at 8 and I won’t get back until 5:45
I’ll probably do it again tomorrow night...
I worry about studying, end up never doing, and I take the test and beat myself up for not studying. I NEVER LEARN
Anyways, like I said, it feels like my job and college have been draining my motivation to do much of anything
🎉
It’s fun. Although, I haven’t been playing it much recently, due to me not having much interest in doing anything lately
They always do
Here’s hoping
I have one <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Sigh, I really want Mario Odyssey...
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
I should be starting a lot of my homework so I don’t have to do it right after work the next couple of days but I’m not
Pretty quiet day today
Fitting
I just realized “Twitch is a bitch” rhymed 😛
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Lol
I’m still wanting an EyanChristmas emote
I forgot about that emote
<:KappaClaus:386358009443647490>
If I knew this would happen, I would’ve brought my headphones and not pay attention to what we’re learning <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Sigh, and yet another stream begins when I get to class...
I wish I could have one morning where I wake up and it doesn’t feel like I need 8 more hours of sleep
“Do school at work” 
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Ok, I’m going to bed. This week is going to be really stressful; I don’t know how I’m going to get all my work done and still go to my job
2017-2017
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Cafeteria? Where are you?
JA
*hears Animal Man shout NEIN in the distance...*
🤔
~~Isn’t he already Flubs?~~
Why 3?
Go get some pizza then. If no pizza restaurants are open, then buy a frozen one from WalMart
~~Will pizza help?~~
🍕
Words words
So I’m just watching YouTube and now typing this message
Tired. It’s getting close to sleeping
Howdy y’all
Meh
*I’m still a terrible conversation starter...*
How about that weather?!
Anyways...
*noms chicken*
Why does killing chickens of all things get you jail time?
I’m all out <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
*drinks milk*
😐
I have a pumpkin pudding pie here. *noms it*
<:CoolStoryBob:327305348698603520>
I hear the Bullskitty alarm
That makes absolutely no sense.
Why do you remove my JA but you keep his NIEN
A Baconator?
🤔
*Hello SquidofBaconator* Hello thoughts...
...
Oh hai
I tend to overthink a lot of things
Lol
NEEEERD <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It makes sense
Sure
*shrug*
But any ice cream, if I eat a lot, I will get sick. Vanilla is just worse
Both
I am able to eat frozen yogurt and sherbet
I can eat a little bit of chocolate fine but NOT vanilla
The thing is, vanilla ice cream is the worst for me
Well, I used to love eating ice cream but it makes me vomit horribly. I haven’t eaten it in 5 years
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Chocolate milk is great
At home, I mostly drink milk
I would love some soda right now
But still good
Needed a little more chicken
It just had too much sauce
I’m just eating chicken wing dip that’s more like a soup
And I’ll take the silence from everyone else as they are out having a life unlike us <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
How’s everyone doing on this Sunday?
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Have a Baconator 🍔
Welcome
Everyone in the world
Then it would be Kingdom of Potatoes
Or Kingdom of 🤔 Hating
~~because everything here is explosives thanks to Flubs~~
🤔
Says the guy who potato-ifies everything 😛
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I think my advice is best; not turning Zeal citizens into 🥔
🎉
I was exposed to radiation when I got turned into a Squid/Baconator hybrid
Meh
I was getting hungry
*noms fries*
They also have nukes. Flubs would be proud <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It’s really weird...
Ok, people in another server are talking to a chicken...
I can only draw stick figures
Ok, I’m starting to get into my nightly “I’m bored” mood
I know what I’m doing now
New StephenPlays GTA Online episode <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
For reasons that I probably won’t get
I can self register for classes so I can do that but I’m not sure my parents would like that
I’m supposed to meet someone at 11 on Tuesday to register for a class but I won’t be able to because my place of work scheduled me to come in at 11:30
Although, there is one thing that’s pissing me off
Ok
JA
Oh hai Dan
🤔
I love you too 😛
Ha
*goes back 31 minutes and eats it all*
...
Well, I just had a nice pumpkin dessert
I go into dinner not very hungry. I still end up eating just about everything. I don’t know how
So you at least have cats...
I want a cat. But I’m allergic...
FUS RO DAH
*hands Skyrim over* You know what to do
The only Elder Scrolls game I have played is Skyrim
Elder Scrolls Online?
I slept 7 hours instead of 8
2 floors and a finished basement
We have 2 trees
It is
One of the trees and a few other things; pictures and stuff
She’s been doing it for a while and there’s a lot; I think that’s why he’s mad
Ok, so my mom is getting a lot of the Christmas decorations out and my dad is getting mad at her
Meh
Nah, I’m done with that game. I don’t feel like going back
I don’t know if I said this to you, but I stopped playing Overwatch
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I’m back from early morning work ya Ninnies
I NEED A MINUTE
Wait, REALLY?!
🎅
“BasicLifeSupport-Prof. Rescuer”
I found one that’s takes 2 days but you’re there from 9-5 😨
Let me check
When looking, I think I saw a 1 credit course where you only go one day, but it’s 7 hours long
3 hours a day
Well, one was 3 days a week for 5 weeks. The other was 4 days for 4 weeks
I took 2 summer classes
Our main semesters are Fall and Spring. But we do have winter and summer classes
Tired
Stop bragging <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
True. But still
Summer? Our semesters are Fall and Spring
Paper and test next week
I got 2 finals to take in 2 weeks and next semester, I have only one class to take because the person who helped me register for classes messed up and I’m short 1 credit
And I don’t care if SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEAK
I like my sleep so I need to go to bed in 2 hours instead of 3
😑😑
I have to go to work at 7:30 tomorrow morning. Which means I need to be awake by 6:30
*noms eggnog*
These next 2 weeks are going to be really stressful
So, the week of classes before finals, I have a test, a paper due, and a lot of online work. Talk about cramming in content until the last minute
I still can’t stop reading his name as Satanite 😛
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Don’t you mean ~~Satanite~~ Santanite?
*Runs to Skyrim or something*
You read my mind
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
WAIT. SHE EXTENDED THE DUE DATE FOR THEM UNTIL NEXT WEEK
😑
Oh joy, I have to do twice the amount of online work due tonight...
I’m playing Splatoon 2 right now
Brb. Game
Lol
~~go see Marilyn Manson~~
The Marilyn Manson record
I’m thinking of Antichrist Superstar when you said that 😛
Plays aren’t that interesting for me
Meh
Wow
In college, you can just leave the class after you finish
JA
Like <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994> but festive
Wait, can we get an Eyan emote with him wearing a Santa hat? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
Half invisible 😛
There
Mobile Discord is like regular Discord. Except all the fun stuff is taken away
BLAME MOBILE DISCORD
Remind me tomorrow
On mobile; can’t change yet
🤔
Meep is what some characters in SpongeBob say <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*slow clap*
Oh hai Animal Man
The other is a LOT more active than this one
The last message on one server was on the 20th
I’m most active on this one, a little active on another, and no one is active on the 3rd one I’m in
I’m either in not enough or just right
I’m in 3

I think I’ll go into VC with some Ninnies in another server
I never know what I’m doing
Meh
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
~~And I first read your name as Satanite~~ I mean what?
It’s too early to be tired
😑
I feel like falling asleep and it’s only 7pm
Because you can tell what every character will be by their hair 😛
PUNS
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms phone*
~~Guru of Baconators~~
Can you give an example?
Yep
That reminds me of how games look like they give you a choice but really, it’s either yes or yes
What is it?
Mine is coming never
🎄
So, at least 6 hours a day
I still have never played it
Oh hai
😏
SOMEONE SAY SKYRIM?!
Fore?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I’m guessing they’re playing this through Pandora or something
This music playing here is annoying me; and the ads that play are even worse
Some visual novels I have seen, like Nekopara, don’t have you even making any choices
I have no idea
Pffft
Yeah, I suggest people stay away from it
Not as bad but still
So it still bugs me
My hands were shaking just telling you about it 😛
It took a day for me to get over it
The first time I saw the suicides and the one girl who straight up talks to you REALLY freaked me out bad
Yes
In order to get the actual good ending, you have to go through all the scenes
And to get out of that part, you have to actually delete her character file
After those, then the big breaking of the 4th wall happens
One girl ends with you finding her after she hanged herself and one, right after she confesses to you, no matter what you answer, she brutally stabs herself
Pretty much, it starts off like your average visual novel but it gets darker as you get further into it and further into the “routes” of each of the girls
Not just one character
Anyways, do you mind me saying what the visual novel I mentioned is about? With spoilers
😐
Ok, I’m in the Commons and Someone started playing piano music
I just thought of the visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club. And you can spoil that game
So, what is To The Moon?
Brb. Class is finishing up
I’m not exactly sure what my mom thinks
Yes; at least my dad does
Not angry but still disapproving
I know I’ve said stuff on this before
They don’t like me spending money on video games
Yeah, but my parents still find stuff to complain about
I know but when you have no direction, it can be hard to take the first step if that makes sense
Because I’m lazy
I think that’s why my parents are pressuring me
Outside of college and my job
Anything that takes a lot of time looking into it, it takes me a while to do something towards it and I end up just lying around the house
That’s pretty much me too
I think that makes a lot of sense
There’s the question of pursuing your interests or finding something that you can make a good living off of
I thought of going for something in video making or game development but I’m not sure if I could find a job in those fields; not sure how many are available
For one, Making YouTube videos
Same
Pressure doesn’t help
I know I’ve said this before but I still don’t know what I want to do or where to go next but I’m getting pressured to figure it out
Well, you probably have a better idea of what you want to do 😛
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I say it depends on if you want to take them or if you’re only taking them because they’re required
I see
This semester has been a drag
1 more week of classes and then finals left
I’m just in class, bored and tired as usual
Bacon and cheese on here
🍔
Play video games?
I have a lot of quests I started but haven’t finished...
BUT I WANT TO PLAY SKYRIM
*goes back to Skyrim* You guys are really distracting, you know that? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yay, pin
No turning Zeal citizens into potatoes
*gets into bunker* blow it up
😑
Smile
😃
I have 74% of the achievements in Skyrim
1 day 11 hours in Overwatch
Skyrim: 6 days, 12 hours, 14 minutes
14 days, 13 hours, 28 minutes
I have over 340 hours into it
Meh, I’ll do that later
Actually, I kind of want to play Fallout 4
“What should I eat? Skyrim.”
I only played through the 1st mansion
Oh
Dark moon?
JAJAJA
🤔🤔🤔
Should I watch anime like a weeb or play Skyrim like an elitist?
Ok, so now...
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
~~SquidofPotato~~
~~Now because I ate the explosives, I turned into a potato~~
And RC, you stole them from Flubs, didn’t you?
Mixed with Squid
It’ll be fun in a few seconds. As always, I die at le- 💀
*noms door* thank you. I was getting hungry
JA
There’s a lot of STEPS to it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
I haven’t seen any fan game that does that yet
My JA was taken away...
🤔
All fandoms have their shitty parts to them
Yes in German
You say NEIN
I say JA
I don’t care
JA
Quadruple tru
We’re already crazy <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
ITS F—KING IRRITATING
The fanbase ALWAYS OVERHYPES EVERYTHING
I try to not have too big of expectations anyways
It’s a nice way to spend the time ☕
I’ve been playing Skyrim but not much of anything else
I have barely been playing any games recently
I’ll probably have no interest in Pokémon left by then
But they’ll never do that because that’s something different, which is a risk. And they don’t want to take risks
In Pokémon Reborn (fan game) all the gym leaders have 6 Pokémon
You’re right Draco
HG is my 2nd favorite
My biggest issue with Pokémon is that they don’t want to take any big chances
I just found everything in gen 6 meh/bland
Main series game on a console
I have been losing interest since X and Y
The cookies can’t be resisted
It’s been a while since the bot last stole cookies
I got more Baconators

So...welcome Bagel?
I don’t have another welcome Baconator yet
😐
Have a welcome Baconator 🍔
Welcome
I don’t know science terms
Statistics not Biology
Formulas, examples, whatever
We are allowed to bring a 3x5 notecard with whatever we want on it for the Statistics test and final
That’s me during the test
It’s weird; I care about getting a good grade but I have little interest in trying to remember this stuff in my classes
Talk about forcing a test in at the last minute
And that’s 5 days before the final
I have a test in Statistics next Wednesday
I’m bored by a lot of things
Meh
Moral of the story: math is boring
I hate having to take only 1 class semester because I’m 1 credit short...
Are the books made out of chrome? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
At the earliest, I’ve had to get on the bus at 6:50
What’s the name of it?
If it’s not a military school, then there’s no reason to go that early
That’s stupid
👋
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
And mine starts in 5 minutes
Science jokes 😐
“Unholy place” So...
Emboar is stupid

What’s next, the Baconator gets a Pokémon? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

It’s face looks weird
Lol
I found it in their chat called “Meme Restaurant”
Saw this in another server and I felt like showing it here
Meh
Maybe if I was more active and had a healthy diet...
I will always be tired no matter if I get 6 hours or 10 hours of sleep
Like play even more Skyrim
If we needed only 4 seconds of sleep in real life, we would have more time to do many things
“Sleep is for the weak” - Flubs
Ok, I’m done playing Skyrim for the night
What?
JA
🤔
And I make YouTube videos so it would be easy
I took 2 video making classes in high school
I think I might take one class called “Basic Filmmaking”
There are 1 credit classes but I’m not sure I want to take any of them
I believe I can take whatever I want because it’s a free elective credit I need
And I still need to figure out what class I want to take for the 1 last credit I need...
Then in 2 weeks, finals
Next week, I have a test in Statistics, a paper for Biology, and finishing up my online class.
Next week, it will all come crashing down...
I don’t really have anything to do yet
Anyways, how is everyone?
Besides, aren’t we all Ninnies anyways?
I say that every time and no one has complained
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
:FeelsAgreeingWithYouMan:
At this point, I just hope to get a C in them and not give a shit about the classes the day after finals
Biology and Statistics. I just haven’t been interested in either of them
Class has just been a real bore recently...
Guess we’re all leaving at once
I should go to sleep too. I got college
Night
Why was that one removed?
My internet stopped working for 7 minutes <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>

Because our generation will be teaching and there will be more gaming adults then
I don’t think many teachers have interest in video games
Instead, I have been spending my time playing Skyrim
I stopped playing Overwatch weeks ago. I just wasn’t enjoying it at all
🎉 or 😑
Here, I can’t eat it
🍨
Cake, pie, ice cream, chocolate, whatever
Eat dessert
Ok, now I feel like eating even though I’m not hungry. At all
Is this a good or bad thing? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Guys, I think I’m getting addicted to Skyrim again
NEIN

Ok, well, Animal Man. Why did you join in on this?
Maybe I should just sleep for 13 hours
He just says “Yes”
Flubs never gives an answer to why he started hating the think
Beats me

Ok
Is that Flubs or Animal Man? Can’t tell on mobile

Now, what should I do?
🎉
I get bored too much
Ok, I’m getting really bored again 😑

<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
🤔
I can’t think of anything
Uhh...
I’m not sure what to do now
Anyways...
That seems to be one of the most important things out there
College has it even worse
We didn’t have as many problems before Spectrum began
Lucky bastards...
Is there anyone who actually has a good, consistent internet connection?
You can barely make out what the other person is saying; it keeps cutting out from the conversation
And our home phone line is even worse
Spectrum is pretty bad when it comes to this stuff. Our modem, when we first got it from them because it’s required, stopped working once a day. It’s calmed down on that but it still does it once in a while
I don’t remember many abbreviations 😛
Oh

Oh. I never heard of it

Is that Secret Santa but with Hitler? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

Alright
Oh hai
Oh hai Animal Man
Ok, now it says the server is too busy
I just think their server sucks or something
I just love how I have a good internet connection yet my college’s site is so slow, I can’t log in 😑

*talk to me* No, thoughts. You’re not interesting
Ok, now that I watched the YouTube videos I wanted to see, I’m bored again
Well, I know the small combo costs $9.85 where I am
1 million
😐
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Anyways, time for work
Meh
And what is an AWM? I’m really bad at knowing abbreviations
How does a shot to your butt kill you?
~~scaredy-Flubs~~
<:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
😐
Because job
For 10 minutes
I’m back
Ja
Brb
I don’t get it
🤔
Liberal Arts; general degree
I think I just need 1 free elective credit
Associates
Meh
Why does something ALWAYS GO WRONG...
We were planning for me to be able to get my degree by the end of the year. Now I probably won't be able to do so...
Well, shit. I checked online and it says I need 1 more credit to graduate
Welcome
I'm finding it really hard to care about my classes anymore
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
😑
I don’t want to go back to college tomorrow...
Belated hello
hi SquidofBaconator is back and not dead
Halfway there to Pink Nu
Hooray, I rank up when no one is around...
🎉
I can’t believe today is the last day of break... 😑
Saw that
*noms potatoes*
I’m back to playing Skyrim. Again
*gives Flubs a s’more and a human* there you go
Ok
Normal unless you request human ones
Anyone want S’mores?
*roasts marshmallows*
🔥
*sets timer*
💣
Once one person puts them up, everyone else has to
And so does a lot of the other neighbors
Yes they do
On a side note, our neighbor has really bright Christmas lights
WHY ARE WE EVEN DOING THIS?! 
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I WIN
THERE
*noms infinity times infinity*
There’s nothing about infinity
I win
*noms Stuck’s amount of nomming* times infinity
NOMS NOMS NOMS NOMMING NOMMING 
*3 days later...*
NOMMING NOMMING
*noms nomming the nomming nomming*
*noms nomming*
*noms touches*
No touch
🔪
I think this is peanut butter fudge
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
This was SquidofBaconator’s Thoughts: only on ZealTV
Random thought: I haven’t had fudge in so long; eating it now feels really good
I just use any excuse to use the <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994> emote
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
He has over 120K subscribers, last I checked
Oh. He’s a Let’s Player and the other server is for his fans
Do you know NicoB?
Yeah, with the other server I’m in, there’s more people which makes it more hectic and harder to keep up with what’s going on
JA
🤔
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*judges*
I’m Someone who can easily get bored
I left because I got bored; if the game doesn’t interest me, I can’t stay interested in the stream
🤔🤔🤔
Yeah...
🤔
“King of Zeal has lost all meaning to his life” 😐
Well, I’ll watch the stream after I get home and eat
It’ll still be a bit until I can watch
I’m almost home.
Is Eyan still streaming?
😑
Oh joy, streaming when I’m not home...
Like so
Anything that makes Skarm more confusing 😛
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
🤔
That ain’t good
My back kept hurting
I kept waking up
I didn’t get good sleep last night
*noms them all* Ok, good night
Ok, I’m really going to sleep now
Don’t question it
Fulbs: the guy Flubs keeps in the dungeon
~~Sends clones of Flubs and Fulbs to Gummy~~ There, people you will love
Good night Ninnies
Ok, I’m going to bed now
And you must wait for the cool down
How is that violent?
It doesn’t trigger the Skarm message if you put his name as the 1st word in the sentence
🧀
You always play it
😏
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
<:Treason:305563730056314880> Why?
The other server I’m in has a nsfw channel
Oh god, I just saw a really weird picture but I can’t show it; nsfw
Hey, I can’t be in VC tonight
~~Antarctica~~
One I like cheese
Two I’m playing Skyrim
There he is
🤔
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
NO, REALLY?!
!concerned
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
e!gummy
If
There’s a bunch of ladies
Don’t even bother trying to understand Skarm’s logic
*noms something*
At least, not yet
No one is dead
So, I’ll take the answer to my question as no
Any of you guys know NicoB?
I use 2 of the 3 I’m in
I was in the one for Chuggaaconroy’s fans for a day but it was way too active
I’m only in 3
Which means he has a more active fanbase
The reason it’s hard for me to keep up in the other server is that it’s the fanbase of a Let’s Player who is actually active 😛
Only a few of us actually watch the show and I never talk about it here because no one else wants to
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~I have trouble keeping up there~~
Hey, I’m on another server too and I don’t have trouble keeping up here
You’re late to the party on that one
e!gummy
*back to Skyrim*
Anyways
Flubs will probably encourage it
~~PotatoWizard~~
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
How do you do that Master?
*noms potatoes*
lol
*continues playing Skyrim OST*
🎉
No noises eh?
*BLASTS SKYRIM OST IN STUCK’S APARTMENT*
I’m on my brother in law’s PS4. He probably hasn’t played it in a while
Ok, Skyrim is done updating <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
~~Someone make art of a Pidgey’s head on a strawberry~~
The Strawberry Pidgey?
While I love my nephew, I still hate children
Running around, screaming and laughing loudly
And my nephew is being really loud right now 😑
I feel like there are hints in other places to the theory that people eat Pokémon
I guess so
~~well, people do eat Pokémon...~~
🤔
It’s a French bulldog. I still don’t get why you would name your dog after a breakfast food
My sister is watching a pet show and one dog is called French Toast
I like hash browns
@Myself
@no one
Oh Skarm... you make no sense
I wasn’t even there at that moment
That can’t be why
I wonder what about me makes Skarm a racist
Why do I make him racist?
😐
Hey Skarm, what’s cracking?
02
🤔
But they DO have Skyrim...
I’m at my sister’s place
Well, I’m bored
Post party would be the 🤔 party
*back to Fallout 4*
Anyways...
*shrug*
I think downvoting a downvote party would mean we support it
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
🤔
*noms hours*
Idk
School and work have taken up a lot of my time
😐
Flubso
Doggo
Ok, must go. Might be back later
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Hi Head ~~Butter~~ Butler Jello
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Lol
🤔
Ok, I’m going to see family. Probably won’t be around much. Unless I get bored
🎉
If I was going to get trampled, I would take a video of it
The mall we passed was packed to the brim
You’d be waiting a VERY long time if you wanted to buy something
I’m at Kohl’s and the line stretches to the back of the store on both sides. Black Friday 😑
Another problem with the original Sun and Moon: there was almost nothing to do outside of battling
Or section off most of the tutorials to a menu
This should be basic game building
Why is it that we aren’t allowed to skip tutorials and cutscenes?
There are many better ways to handle it
I just don’t see why they have continuously made the games with more hand holding
The anime in gen 6 was good; the games were very meh
While gen 5 is my least favorite, gen 6 is when I really started to lose interest in Pokémon
My least favorite part of gen 5 was the anime and movies
While I don’t really like gen 5, N is one of the best parts of it
Gold was my very 1st video game (not just Pokémon) and Diamond was the 1st one I finished
3rd favorite game
I love Platinum
I really like gens 2, 3, and 4
I remember seeing one guy years ago getting a Shiny Rayquaza in Emerald
😐
I once got a shiny Chimchar in Platinum when I picked my starter. It REALLY surprised me
Last shiny I got was a Linoone in Omega Ruby
This isn’t orgasmic you ninny...
I see Skarm bot is acting dumb again 😛
🤔
Personally, I go for the Argonian
What race is your character?
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
*noms it*
Uhh...
Vomiting: one of Stuck’s passtimes
Well, the mods I used in Fallout 4 game me unlimited crafting supplies and showing the full text when you are supposed to say something (Ex:Instead of just showing *sarcastic* it shows the whole sentence)
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Lol
So, how many chickens are added to the game?
Lol
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
The chickens tasted like chicken
*noms chickens*
The only game I’ve used mods for is Fallout 4
I think I saw a mod for Skyrim that changes the beginning a little to skip over that
I played Skyrim for like 6 hours today. It’s been a while since I played a game for that long in one day, thanks to college and my job...
ULTRA QUALITY: It’s like regular quality. BUT ULTRA
Good job
💀
*starts throwing snowballs* This is all I do with snowballs
😐
Flubs is a snowball now?
Wait, what’s going on?
🍕
😏
Maybe Flubs and Gummy
I’m not sure if I belong anywhere
Gummy, most of us are still older than you
🤔
😑
Like I said earlier, my name is the same as a 3rd gen Pokémon
😐
🎻
And you still never guessed my name
Oh hai Will
*gives Gummy coal*
Ok, we are done guessing my name
That won’t help Gummy
You said you had an idea?
Anyways, RC
No
This is pointless
*hits Gummy with a newspaper*
You’re never going to get it right
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
e!gummy
You are completely off base
NOOOO
No 😑
2 more guesses
Hoenn
I have the same name as a Pokémon
Should I give a hint?
What’s the channel?
🤔
If I was Brantley Gilbert, I would be rich
I’m sure
My name isn’t Brantley Gilbert you ninny...
🎉
COME ON
😐
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Nope
3 tries
Then guess my name Gummy
*shrug*
Is Gummy a Riven?
Why would Skarm be fighting with Gummy?
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
My friends don’t call me
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
No one should know my name; I don’t think I have ever said it to anyone
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
🤔
Creepy
😏
*forces Gummy to play Skyrim*
GURU OF WHAT?! <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

DO IT
Go play Skyrim Gummy
How many times are you going to change your name?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
I don’t feel like changing my name but if I do, it will be Squidof*insertsomethinghere*
Ice Cream?
🍨
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
e!gummy
🎅
P5 is great
Oh hai RC
Gummy, it shows a human based off a pony
🎄
Gummy, when will you admit your deep love for Flubs?
What kind of pie?
JA
🤔
Bathtub full of potatoes...
e!treason
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
DID WE SAY YOU COULD EAT OUR PIE?!
I had apple pie earlier
JA
🤔
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Anyways, how’s your day?
WAAAAHN
No need to get it when I already have it
Xbox One
Oh hai Animal Man
Actually I’m still playing Skyrim 😛
I’m back after playing more Skyrim
WEEEEEEEEB
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Some people still call it supper
We ate at 1 so it’s more like Thanksgiving lunch
For us, 12 is lunch and 5 is dinner
We don’t eat that late
Yes
I still feel full from all the food and dessert
Happy Thanksgiving
No I don’t <@293200537384386562>
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Where’s your profile pic?
-Once sad
“SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEEK”
Probably sleep
Now I’m so full, I feel like I have to just sit
It’s delicious
It was a pumpkin sheet cake with stuff on top
Pumpkin cake
Thanks to a slice of apple pie and a pumpkin cake thing
Ok, I’m even more full now 😑
🇺🇸 :f: 💣 <:Yea:327308337722949642>
I haven’t seen that episode of ERB in years
Another profile pic change
I’m watching the rerun of the Thanksgiving Day Parade. And they have a bunch of clowns 😨
*noms potato*
🤔
Sam is Flubs
It is
Cooked ham is the best
I’d rather eat ham than turkey
Do you like turkey Flubs?
At least until it’s time for dessert
Now I just want to sleep
Anyways, most people have Thanksgiving dinner between lunch and dinner time
!GummySkyrim
And there’s still dessert
Ok, I feel really full now...
Well, family is starting to arrive
I just checked and Flubs is very close to becoming a Pink Nu
What’s that?
Compact mode?
Gummy, why did you change your profile pic to Rarity?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
American Football
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
I can’t be drunk yet so I have to be good
It’s fun if you’re really good, really bad, or really drunk
My whole family plays it
I like golf
SOAP OPERAS ARENT A SPORT
SPORT
e!gummy
2nd least favorite? What’s your 1st Dragonite?
We don’t have people over for a couple more hours
!GummySkyrim
And he always tells you
But you always ask him to hang out or something
While I was fighting one dragon, a second one came out
I’m just playing Skyrim
🤔
Ok, so they’re cooking the turkey down here in the basement so my mom can use the oven more and it smells good down here 😛
I think we still have the Tigger movie on VHS
I can’t remember the last time I watched either
I haven’t watched a Winnie the Pooh movie in such a long time
*something fancy*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Sir Tigger 😃
That’s another thing I got from him
It always sounds like he’s mad about something and if he actually is, it’s worse
Man, my dad’s voice is annoying
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
That sounds classy
🤔
I’ll have to do it tonight
Shit, I just remembered I probably have online class work to do
🎉
That’s brilliant <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Ok
Morning
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
That’s nothing to <:SeemsGood:327307864463114250> lol
One thing I do get from my dad: we’re not very happy people
I will say, the holidays aren’t easy and my dad doesn’t usually make it easier for my mom. 
Don’t get me wrong; he’s not a bad person
He usually goes over the same things
No
It’s always like this; my dad always finds something to complain/argue about
And of course my dad is complaining about something...
And I get 8 hours of sleep yet I still feel like I only got 4 😑
Happy Thanksgiving everyone
He ate a large plate of food and a pumpkin pie in 42 minutes
If you thought you ate a lot on Thanksgiving
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=frJ0-WL2YRI
Before I go to bed...
My internet stopped working for a minute
Doggo
The ones I just posted
Then go up the steps
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
No
😃
I heard potatoes are everywhere
Oh hai
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
I’d recommend Pokémon Reborn and Insurgence
I might end up playing HeartGold or just hang around here
I’m in bed now
What should I do now?
Well, It’s done playing Skyrim and there’s nothing left on YouTube to watch
🤔
You’re right Gummy; he’s your husbando <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😏
~~Yeah, you’re more than friends~~
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
These are delicious

Don’t mention that show here
Salt and vinegar potato chips?
That looks like cyanide <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I’m doing so right now
!GummySkyrim
Is he Canadian?
~~it will never arrive~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Doubt it
e!gummy
~~he would tell you to play Skyrim~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
Yep, I know it’s close to Thanksgiving when my parents start fighting about something for the holidays
e!gummy
And one of our neighbors gave us a basket of homemade fudge and cookies 
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*sees reaction* So, I should 🤔 until then?
And I have nothing to do until then
Well, 20 minutes before I have to go to work
🤔
*is playing video games*
Maybe he just doesn’t want to talk to you <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I would rather listen to Skyrim music
Rap/hip hop is awful
And people ignore the flaws in other genres because country music is the punching bag
I GET IT. NO ONE BUT ME LIKES COUNTRY MUSIC. That’s what I tend to think when I see the hundreds of videos like this
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I think it’s the biggest country song out right now
What?
Here
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uXyxFMbqKYA
I blew the runway up remember?
It’s ok
Yeah, it’s country
Gummy, no TSwift.
Country
Oh hai Vortex
No TSwift
WE CANT AGREE ON ANYTHING
Here’s someone popular
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q24MOFOscH4
😑
Ok, let’s listen to something not rock
😏
It looks like Flubs coming back caused Gummy to die
Also
What’s wrong with rock music?
Listen
How about this? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w-SO2KqTxAc
e!treason
Take a shot every time I die here
No, I “borrowed” them
💀
I grabbed a lot of explosives
*blows it up*
This means war then https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgk3u44W2i4
*blows up runway* WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?!
It IS my favorite song
🔪
😡😡😡
The Pixar movie
It was in Cars
The cover is my favorite song of all time
There’s the original version and the Rascal Flatts cover
Life IS A Highway
*noms nomming*
No
*shoots water*
🔫
And there goes Flubs...
~~Someone put a queen’s crown on <:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>~~
~~So Eyan is a Queen now?~~

I’m not sure if I will even enjoy it
I’m still not sure if I should get Ultra Moon
We aren’t talking about MLP <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>

I know all Flubs will do when I join is make earrape
🤔
Earrape?
🤔
Excuses...
Socks
What about it?
Xenoblade?
RMoo
Stuck in a Moo
SquidofMoonator
Flubs?
Flubs, I have been purple for a while now
Oh hai
😏
So, Skarm likes RC now?
*calls therapist* Yes, we need you to come to the Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
This is becoming a regular thing
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
And it seems like Flubs doesn’t hate the think anymore
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
Don’t take it Flubs
😏
*noms ceiling*
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
And I don’t need Skarm to tell me that
THAT QUIZ WAS STUPID
There’s more types than that
Ninnies
Are you trying to kill us all?
Gummy, your dating advice will guarantee whoever follows it is single for life
🍪
🍔
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
Ok, Flubs is really slacking on his job
🤔
Him
As always, it’s entertaining seeing Majestic “interact” with Skarm
LIKING GUMMY IS RACIST ACCORDING TO SKARM
🤔
Probably at school
But I can question the moderators <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Not what I meant
Now, I’m playing Skyrim and questioning some of these mods...
I had work earlier
Let’s see: the most popular mod in Skyrim is one that puts lingerie on the girls 😐
Well, if you played Skyrim like I am right now, then Dragonite wouldn’t kill you. At least for the moment <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Stuck in a Discord~~
😏
What?
Ok, since Gummy won’t play Skyrim, I guess I’ll go play it in his place
Yes RC <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
I feel like I’m going to get a lot of use out of the e!gummy command
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
e!treason
DAMMIT
*noms history book*
But Gummy doesn’t want to play Skyrim so it works
I like that punishment Dragy
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
Aye
e!treason
I actually was playing Skyrim earlier
I already asked that for myself 😑
So am I
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
!GummySkyrim
e!gummy

😨
*noms schedule* Now you don’t have to do anything 😛
*noms something*
😐
I don’t want to sleep yet
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I would end up just falling asleep if I read
I don’t like reading
What should I do?
Well, I’m bored
💣 + Gummy’s 📱 = Fun
😏
Yeah, I don’t know what’s going on
Uhh...
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Anyways, I really should get ready for work now. See y’all in a few hours
Later
I work at a grocery store
People are stupid
Although, stores aren’t as busy on Black Friday anymore due to the rise of online shopping and opening on Thanksgiving
I’ve seen a lot of Black Friday videos
🎻
Ramsay would be disappointed <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
People have to order them. We advertise that they’re “Fresh; never frozen” but they come in frozen
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Most other places around here are $1 something a pound or even cheaper; ours are $3.19 a pound
I don’t know how we sell so many turkeys; they’re expensive
And it’s going to be REALLY busy today and tomorrow since that’s when everybody will be buying their turkey, pies, and whatever
Yes
It feels like I was just there last night
I have to go to work in 20 minutes
I’m ok
I see that Gummy’s being a Baka. As usual...
You do that. I’ll sleep
Ok, I’m going to bed now

<:Yea:327308337722949642>
Lol
Uhh, does Majestic need to see a therapist? I think the interactions with Skarm aren’t good for Majestic’s health
Gummy = Majestic? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ok, I’ve had enough of whatever’s being played in Corridors
Yep

I get a lot of entertainment out of seeing Skarm and everyone interacting
<:Senate:308758612455587841>
I see that Master 😛
😏
Lol
Gummy has nothing to do with this
“Big Macaroni?”
🍔 Because Baconator
It’s something
I don’t know Master 😛
Deci? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
You do
Good, Skarm didn’t steal them
🍩
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
Why a green apple?
In all my time here, I never thought Flubs would willingly listen to music
I feel like I’m going to get a LOT of use out of the <:GummyFish:380552346020610050> emote
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
Oh hai RC
e!gummy
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
Also Majestic, why did you say 🍔?
🔥
🤔
Oh hai Flubs
I’m tired and I still have 2 busy days at work to get through before Thanksgiving
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Anyways, how’s everyone else doing?
7
Wow, I’m tired...
😏
🤔
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
That’s true but irrelevant you bot... 😑
Better than what Skarm would do
*gives Majestic chicken* This is what you wanted, right? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why?
Just something dumb I felt like sharing 😛
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
Random thought: Well, this is a little weird. I’m having a frozen dinner that not only an extra piece of chicken, but there is a lot more cheese in the Mac and cheese than usual
It’s like my teammates weren’t even doing anything
Well, I decided to play Overwatch again and it’s going even worse than I expected
And for those who want to function normally
Sleep is for people who have to do stuff in the morning
Good night
Ok, I’m done
😏
Ok, I’m going to sleep. Any last words?
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065> + 🎵 = 🤢
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050> + <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065> = 🍥
Seems like Gummy is still in the denial stage
😐
~~cuddling with Flubs?~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I dreamed that I met Flubs once. He was not good looking...
😨

🤔
~~ban him~~
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
😏
I leave for 5 minutes and this chat turned into the Kingdom of Gummy and Flubs again
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
That video was hilarious
Well, I’m bored. Skarm say something funny
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Put on socks
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Ok, <@239928598696427520> Set Gummy on fire. He said it was your job <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
As Flubs would suggest: Set yourself on fire
😏😏😏
Don’t do it Flubs
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
But I have to go in 3 days in a row 😑
Although, I do wish I didn’t have to go to work for the next 3 days
I need money
Work was boring as hell
🤔
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
😏
You love Flubs
No
Any last words?
Well, I got 10 minutes before I need to go to work for the rest of the night
And she barely eats so she I don’t know how she’s alive
She has had a stroke in the past and now she’s pretty much an idiot nowadays
My mom sometimes need that done to her. But my 80 year old aunt is the WORST
Lol
“SO THEY HAVE CHICKEN AND ALSO STEAK AND...”
And this person explaining everything was LOUD
I remember one time when I was at a restaurant, at another table, one old lady had to have EVERYTHING read and explained to her by another at the same table
“What’s a men-uu?” <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
That’s stupid
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Honestly, I don’t like it when a waiter is overly friendly
😑
What’s wrong?
Lol
Texas Roadhouse eh? Last time I ate there, I got country fried steak and it was drowning in gravy. WAY too much
Neither do I
So, it looks like Skarm and Majestic’s relationship is going well <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
4 episodes then wait a year
Yeah, that sounds stupid
I never saw anything from Castlevania before
*noms pokes*
Well, I’m bored
Welcome. Have a Baconator 🍔
I must go to sleep now
😏
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
Yes
I agree with RC
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
e!treason
I like nomming
*noms explosives* There, now THA- 💀

😏
It feels like people over here in America can’t handle anything sensitive
😑
😐
How did they edit it?
I think
But Sun and Moon actually had a Pokémon dying
That would be 1 step in the right direction
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
🚽
Even X and Omega Ruby, I replayed a few times
I only replayed it once
That game has almost no replayability
I hope enough changes for me to feel like I’m not just replaying Moon again
I can’t talk at the moment; parent nearby and I’m embarrassed to talk
They have been making it easy starting with gen 6
Pokémon just wants to pander to 7 year olds and stop any and all progression to tell us stuff that we could learn ourselves
And Paper Mario: you can skip tutorials
I don’t care who it’s aimed towards
Still. You should still be able to skip tutorials
We get a whole week off here
I also have all week off next week
*shrug*
Meh
I will literally be unable to stay awake
😒
I will be sleeping by that time
People just want to f.  X. C. K us over
Yep
Weird. For a little bit, I could connect to Discord but all the channels wouldn’t load and I couldn’t comment
e!gummy
🍺
!GummySkyrim
No
At least Skarm doesn’t hurt our heads with walls of text
I leave for 5 seconds and I come back to a wall of text
😐
Still better than Skarm bot
Bad answer
Flubs, why do you hate 🤔
Looks like we found out Gummy’s down vote trigger
^_^
Well, here’s SpongeBob thinking 😛
^_^
Oh shit, I forgot to save the link to the gif I showed
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
Anyways, now that I’m on break, I have a little more free time
🎉
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
Oh, I see it now 😛
What’s that supposed to look like?
Oh I’m just fine <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Oh hai Chewy
Ok, I didn’t die
Ok, dinner time
~~Gummy is Stuck’s rebound~~
Oh hai Dan
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Flubs* Well...
😏
Well, I’m back
Well, those guys are getting old...
Oh shit, he passed away?
Good night Ninnies
I’m going to sleep now
I’m tired
My first tests this year: 80 and 86. Second tests: 53 and 63

My Let’s Play is automatically a lot more boring than this
Everyone here is always trying to talk over one another
Same RC
🎉
I’m a very unhealthy person
😐
Buy some food
e!gummy
I’m just playing Pokémon HeartGold
So, Gummy. You have your milkshake. Does it bring all the boys to the yard? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Which dog?
A Flubs appeared
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Now I really want another episode of StephenPlays GTA Online to be uploaded...
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
And wishing I had that many friends to play it with
Mainly because watching StephenPlays GTA Online has me wanting to play it
I’d rather play GTA 5
I’m not
🎉
It’s supposed to rain a lot tomorrow
How about that weather?!
So...
I’m here now
No, it’s part of my Let’s Play and very few people have been watching it
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER
Ok, I uploaded a video to YouTube a few hours ago and literally no one watched it 😑
*CANT A SQUID JUST NOM IN PEACE?!*
Oh for fuc- 💀
I didn’t steal them; I nommed them
I said no
Noooo
There you go
🚪
No wait, he’s playing “With you ;)”
Stuck is stuck in another box
I think it had to do with being on my feet at work for a while and the toenail was getting a little long. I cut it yet it still hurts
When I get bored, I mention stupid shit like this
Anyways, random thought: my big toe on my left foot has been hurting for the past couple of days and I don’t know why
You always are
Doubt it
I understand that Skarm likes stealing cookies
Sigh
Lol
e!gummy
I understand
They’re ponies. Get it right <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
The only thing Omega Ruby did better was slight story improvements
I prefer Emerald over Omega Ruby
USUM are more like Platinum, Emerald, and Crystal
Because BW2 are sequels
It’s like Platinum: you don’t need Diamond to understand
I WONT support a game with an insane amount of handholding
I will say, if these games have the same amount of tutorials and handholding as the regular ones, I will REFUSE to buy it
I’d prefer Moon. I don’t have it
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Hmm, I think I’ll go with fantasy
So, Skyrim vs Something science fiction
Science Fiction vs Fantasy
Oh, Splatfest is tomorrow
Well, I think I’ll play Splatoon 2 now. Haven’t played it in a while
You should've been in the other server I'm in earlier. They were OBSESSED with pizza
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Ida*
My 1st message wouldn't send
God, the nicknames these people have in this game 😑
🤔
*runs*
A drunk goose
Discord has been really drunk these past couple of days
Flubs, he said yes
~~cuddle with Flubs~~ <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Did that work?
*noms help*
Ok, this other chat is just obsessed with pizza right now...
~~thanks Day is when you buy a flat screen tv now~~
JA
Get a big one
Eat turkey
🤔
🎉
Oh hai Animal Man
Oh hai Dan
I’m currently in another VC hearing debate over pineapple pizza
🔫
😡
That’s Stuck’s cane...
Idk
I remember. I still don’t agree with that. Personally, I just find that too much
Why would you think more than 6 is good?
What?
😐
*sighs*
And now one of them is going to send “a really f—ed up one”
*shrug*
90% of these memes they send are stupid sexual ones...
Lol
AND WHY ARE MY FRIENDS STILL SENDING STUPID MEMES
Why has Discord been acting stupid so much these past couple of days?
The other servers are working fine for me
Why are my friends obsessed with sending stupid memes to each of us...
And now my friends are sending memes. AGAIN
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Again
Eww a flubs
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I feel like I was going to say something but then Discord crashed
Anyways...
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
Anyways, it’s 🍕 time
It’s not night yet
Looks like he’s playing Civ V
Not here
You know, I only first heard about that last year
Maybe a bigger crowd on that Small Business Saturday thing
We’re a local grocery store so we probably don’t get the big crowd
I still have to go to my job; probably not on Thanksgiving Day, but I think I’ll have to work Wednesday and/or Black Friday
Anyone else have work to do over Thanksgiving break?
So, I’m feeling both <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025> and <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
At least until I have to do stuff for the online class next week because she isn’t giving us a break, I think
Anyways, I just finished my online class work so I can now finally relax over break! <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
My parents are still fine with getting me Pokémon games for Christmas. I think...
And I have bad luck
Without spending a ton to get some...
But I still want more money
...I want money
🤔
Bingo is boring
😒
That’s giveaways in a nutshell: just trying to get followers quickly
All giveaways are pretty much clickbait
I rarely ever win anything
But is the giveaway actually legitimate?
No wait, I did have a dream last night. Something about going to a college in a city
Now, I just have to do my online work before I can start relaxing during break
I woke up late yesterday. I still managed to get to class on time
Same
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Still got a quiz and a lot of online work to do though 😑
Well, today’s the last day of class before break 🎉
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Keepo:327304799919800321>
This will get Flubs here for you
🤔
Meh
I’m always hungry, except when I’m not
*noms fanfiction*
“Once upon a time, go to sleep.”
🤔
Should we prepare for yet another funeral?
If they show it on tv, then I will
That from the movie? No wonder I never heard it
Then just tell us because no one else will guess
Something Taylor Swift
OK
LOUDER
Get a hearing aid then <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Gummy, what is with you and getting Flubs to get rid of your hearing tonight?
Get grammar good
Flubs, I think he’s talking about Fulbs <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Sigh
😐
You should stop being a tsundere and just admit your love for Flubs 😏
Flubs will definitely want to cuddle with you Gummy <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
I don’t cuddle because I have no one to cuddle with <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I also wish lucid dreaming was easy to do
I remember starting to dream and thinking about what I should dream but then I woke up 😑
🤔
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Flubs will be in Gummy’s harem
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😏
For many reasons
I really want to learn how to lucid dream; that would be awesome
Anyways, I hope someone talks about having a dream about the server tomorrow to continue the trend <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Arrow?
Lastly, I was on a water slide at one point in the dream. I don’t know why
Oh, and the part of my dream about the server: I met Flubs and he was saying (in my dream) beforehand that he wasn’t that good looking and when I saw him, 🤢
Random level up
🎉
I think I was watching the StephenVlog video when he had to get his appendix removed and then I found out I needed mine removed 😛
But I was in the hospital at one point
Sadly, no
Anyways, I remembered I had a dream last night and part of it was about this server
Micro transactions should just go away
Oh, I just remembered something
🤔
Oh, that explains this intense pain in my stomach. But I’m sure I’ll b- 💀
Why?
*noms shibilly shibila* I was getting hungry
OF COURSE
So, what should I do instead?
WELL EXCUSE ME FOR LIKING SOMETHING
I see you took away “congratulations”
It’s just for the night
😐
Ok, I’m done ~~being a weeb~~ watching anime
And complaining on Discord about being lazy and bored <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Now, it’s time for being lazy and bored
That’s an after 9 thing
It’s too early for that
Thanks for being so helpful *sarcasm*
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Anyways, I’m not sure what I should do now
League stuff. 😑
Well, it takes Juan to know Juan <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Another pic change
Juan?
😐
🤔
That’s what’s wrong <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Picklefishlips
Because you guys said it was treason when I was talking about another server 😛
29 servers...
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Although I’m only in 3 😛
All the servers for me went down once for a second
It’s not just this server
DISCORD. WORK RIGHT FOR 5 MINUTES
Discord, stop being drunk
🐢
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
I like snakes
6 is slightly above average. 7 is pretty decent. 8 is really good. 9 is great. 10 is perfect
I think the 10 system is fine
🍰
🎉
😐
So yeah, only breakfast food today. For breakfast, a sandwich from McDonald’s. Lunch: cereal because I didn’t feel like making anything. Dinner: pumpkin 🥞
Set it up between the Bullskitty alarm and the Take Your Meds Alarm
Should we set an alarm so you remember to eat?
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I don’t think I’ve ever done that
Well, I just had only breakfast items for all my meals today
https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-mrw-see-2H67VmB5UEBmU
😏
Next to the bombs
It was Stuck’s anyways
Whatever. *noms flamethrower*
🤔
Did the flamethrower help?
*uses flamethrower on Dragonite’s fingers*
I finished recording my next video
Oh hai Will
I went to class. Then I came home. I am the most interesting person here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I have never been to or seen a Chik Fil A
🎉
I overslept and I only had 10 minutes to get ready and go to class
Well, this morning was a little hectic
<:GummyFish:380552346020610050>
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🎻
My phone has just been bugging out a lot
Not just from Discord
Actually, it has been doing that quite a bit recently
When I went back into Discord a minute ago, my phone restarted on its own
Anyways, something weird just happened
Oh hai Animal Man
Gummy just needs to stop being a tsundere and admit his love for Flubs
🎉🎉🎉
<:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
🤔
e!treason
NO

Too much time
e!gummy
That’s not a compliment
Just what I expected from Gummy
What you’re doing is incredibly stupid
😒
ANYWAYS
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Flubs, what do you think of what I just posted?
Giant 🤔
This guy in another server gets it 😛
Living
You need to eat
That’s not enough for a meal
Why not make a sandwich?

Again
Why?
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
What is it about?
But that’s nothing new
I’m getting bored again
Meh
That won’t help
*noms window blinds*
You said you had an interesting day

I used to watch it quite a bit when I was younger

Why 10 channels?

Shut up thoughts. You got here the same time I did
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Someone tell me a joke
Well, now I don’t know what to do
🍿
*watches as the dogs bite Gummy’s hand*
In my opinion, the worst scenario would be if Gummy or Flubs were in charge here <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What does that have to do with sleeping?
Wait, isn’t anorexia when you starve yourself?
*shrug*
Do you really think the drug head can be trusted?
*shoots tranquilizer dart at myself* tHIs DoeSNT HeLP
It’s probably because of me being really lazy and a REALLY unhealthy eater
That’s how I always am, even if I sleep 9 hours
Night Ninnies
Ok, I’m really going to sleep now
I don’t think I ever had a dream about anything or anyone here
I didn’t see it. I was at my job in my dream 😛
Nah
Maybe we will meet in the dream world 🤔
😏
Don’t sleep then
Don’t burn the place down, Ninnies
And I think I’m going to sleep a little early since I fell asleep late last night
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>

Squids do not equal bunnies
What’s your new profile pic supposed to be?
There. Fixed
~~listen to anything except death screaming~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~because you don’t like music~~
And 🤔 a lot
That leaves me clueless
Probably because I don’t get out much <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And I still remain single
That’s how some girls are
e!treason
They say “No, stooop” but they really want them to keep going
Some girls like that
They’re probably jealous
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
It stopped in 10th grade, I think
I have been bullied in the past in school
I’ve been called gay; as an insult
Probably not at any community college
We don’t have game design at the community college I go to. <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Oh
What is it?

<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Aww
~~are you marrying Flubs?~~ <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>

Grammar good

I’m back from work once again
See ya in 6 1/2 hours
Well, now it’s time for me to work a really long time after not getting much sleep last night. 😑
e!gummy
😒
That's... a really weird dream
What was it about?
😐
For a general degree
I don’t really even like it; I’m just taking it because it’s required
Biology
I usually don’t leave for another half hour
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Well, my professor just said there’s no class today
Do you except any different?
Lol

How about Fulbs? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

*noms sugar cubes*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*sees Gummy gets banned*
Another level up
🎉
e!gummy
Wow...
*noms mashed potatoes* I now know everything that happened
You’d never tell it
MY MASHED POTATOES!! NOOO
Rule 1 of the Kingdom of Thinking Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™ Gummy lies
LIAR
Nerd 😑
DAMMIT
YAY
So, what happened?
💀
So, I nommed a cane out of potassium?
*noms something* Does this help us?
SOMEONE TELL US
!FishingPole
Lol
What?
TELL US
What happened?
~~Don’t eat me~~
😐
Oh hai Vortex
And that’s why Flubs isn’t in charge
😏
e!PLAYSKYRIMGUMMY
“Here lies Gummy’s hopes and dreams”
⚰
☕
...what?
So Gummy does Flubs with a bone? <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
*looks at pins*
The dogs will take the bone and beat you with it <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

~~Send Sarah after Gummy~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I like dogs
Why are we still talking about Will? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I still get the doggos right?
Will? What about her? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Gummy is committing treason again
“Hey, I just killed your boyfriend and now I’m taking all of his stuff. Ok, SEE YA!”
You
I get his doggos
I hear the Bullskitty alarm again
e!treason
Gummy killed Flubs
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
😐
I’ve been busy with Battlefield 1
Oh RC. You changed your pic
Mac and cheese is good

Exactly
And Skarm’s message didn’t help 😛
STOP YELLING AT ME
THIS IS ALL I GOT

He always has room in his heart for you
~~go join him~~ <:KappaPride:379352530863521792>
No dislikes to the think. Flubs is slacking on his one job <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
Can we even grind stats here? Oh wait, that would be spamming 😛
YEEEAH
I WASNT HERE WHEN YOU ORDERED IT
🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
Meh
What is the game?
I’m about to play video games that tranquil music would not be fitting <:Kappa:374346980136058893>

All because my printer was paused and I had to figure out how to get it not paused
Wait, I missed fast food talk? <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>

How do you accidentally walk into a clothes store?
Also, do you ever look for a map in there?
YAY
I'm fine
Oh hai Prince
😐
🤔
Weird. It worked on my phone yet not on my computer
e!gummy
I'm ok; still doing work that was due this past Thursday that I can turn in tomorrow because my professor doesn't really care about us turning things in after due dates. <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Oh hai Will
Or you could just use your phone and mobile Discord but whatever
🎉
I just felt like using it
Nothing
And my professor has made this more complicated than it should be <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Ok, I need to get to doing the work that was due last Thursday 😑
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Eyanland? Don't you mean the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™ ?
Not the youngest one here
I'm 19
I remember him saying it and not really getting it 😛
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I remember that old joke
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Quiet you
Instead of having Skarm censor me
I just use f---ing
What's going on?
Well, I ran out of things to do
🤔
e!gummy-b
That’s random
I don’t like chili
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Still. I wish I knew what I was doing
Well, I got a 63 on my Statistics test. At least it’s not a failing grade
Well, it’s snowing now
Meh
😏
Yeah
*noms ribs* Oh wait, these aren’t the right ribs to eat

I’m in VC in another server listening to guys getting scarred from horror stuff <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Homework is not due until Tuesday
I mean I have to go to my job
I do have to work later
Video call?
Morning
I don’t know how people can sleep for that long
And you say sleep is for the weak
Well, I slept for 9 hours. I haven’t done that in a long time
Sleep it is then
🤔
Well, now I don’t know what to do
Looks like the usual shenanigans are happening
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
🤔
So, will it be a sandwich, a cookie, Majestic’s life, or all of the above? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I see what you’re doing Master <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
Hey, I’m doing it in good fun. Majestic sounds like a bot killing spree is in the future <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Because you aren’t cool at all? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Majestic has really been going ballistic at Skarm and the other bots today 😛
e!PLAYSKYRIM
🤔🤔🤔
I know how to get him
Not here
Wow, that’s not good. Hope things go well for Dan
It’s probably because I’m not good at talking which makes it hard to put it on paper
I hate writing
50K? I can barely write 500 😛
Fine
Oh hai Will
Doing so would be treason <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
~~Bob~~
And step 9
Did you forget Step 3?
No
Step 15: Get bored of making lists and move on to something else
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
e!treason
Step 12: If you have nothing to study for, screw around on Discord
e!gummy
Step 9:
Step 7: Don’t question what we’re doing
Step 5: If you don’t follow steps 3 and 4, you are going to have a bad time
I almost forgot. Step 3: Don’t take Gummy’s advice
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Don’t even try?
Step 2: Repeat step 1
Step 1: Don’t give advice
If anyone’s interested in how bad that looked, I can link an old video
I originally did videos on bad webcams, back when I didn’t have a clue at what I was doing
Yeah Draco
I still record my videos with my IPhone. I don’t want to spend a lot on buying a camera. Besides, this works fine

Let’s eat cake then
🎉
Anyways, why is November also a bad month?
Oh no, not Mew 😨
Well, fix your mood
Why do people keep saying it’s treason <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Well, I’ve been here a little less ever since I joined another Discord server
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
A thousand
I didn’t know how else to word that
I see the spirit of Flubs and anti-thinking continues even when he’s not here
🤔
The thing is a thing <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
*watches as the pancakes get stolen*
I had lunch already. It was disappointing
*noms potato* I love potatoes

You need to say at least 4 words to trigger Skarm
SCREAMS
I’m glad I invested in this tranquilizer gun <:Keepo:327304799919800321>

Oh, her
I haven’t played Chrono Trigger in years

So Skarm works for Amazon, eh?

It will go on forever <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*grabs 🍿* This is entertaining
NaCl is Sodium Chloride. A.k.A: salt
Really?
How would potassium help this Skarm situation?

I really hate dealing with people like this...
Now I know 2 people whom I’m blocking
And I also love people who don’t listen to what I’m saying

I just love assholes who keep bugging me

You’re the one who always has the explosives
*looks at Flubs*
I did it right before the explosives were attached
And now it’s gone

HA!
Flubs, Gummy is just going to hold you back

Now go get good
Oh look: it doesn't exist

IT'S NOT THE SAME GAME
2014 is 3 years ago. You could've forgotten a lot of it
That summarizes most of Gummy's sentences

Quiet you
e!gummy
I practice for Battlefield 1 with GTA 5. Both have guns. Still makes no sense
I'm not sure if that would be the best game to train for CSGO
*grabs 🍿*
😏
How can I get more motivated to study when I can’t stay focused or interested in it for more than a few minutes? I’m not sure what to do.
I ended up leaving a page blank because I had no idea what to do
I don’t know why I don’t change my habits 😑
I know that if I don’t study for the test even just a little, I will go in not knowing what to do. But at the same time, I can’t stay focused or care enough to spend time just looking over stuff
I’m not sure what to do this morning
Morning
League talk bores me. I’m going to bed
I thought you roll?
Good job Dlubs
And I’m making side comments 😛
These two keep talking over each other; it’s funny

I’m not sure I remember what I need to do on the test
Welcome to the Gummy Podcast: only on ZealTV
Well, now I get to hear this ☕
I see Flubs is being Flubs as usual

Oh, Gummy’s in VC alone
Idk

I’ve been recently playing Battlefield 1 again
I don’t play it
I’ve had one from Wegmans where it had a peanut butter filling
Boston Kreme doughnuts are where it’s at
I’m done talking about it for now
I’m not one for socializing. Or just opening up to some person I don’t know
Thanks
At this point, I’m just trying to get through these courses
I have been losing motivation to do a lot of things recently; even most of my video games aren’t interesting me
I’m honestly thinking that might be it
I’m doing a Liberal Arts degree; just a general degree
And I don’t think there’s an easy fix to this
I have very little motivation to care about them anymore
I’m finding that my interest in these courses is rapidly declining
You need at least 11 to be considered full time here. I have 10
So where do you work now?
😒
H-how do you take 30 credits?!
Which I also have to go to tomorrow <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Damn, 2 jobs? I only have 1
Because I’m taking classes that I’m only doing because the credits are required for my degree that I could  care less about...
I’m taking 3 classes and I’m still stressing out
I didn’t remember to look over Cells
The problem was almost half of the multiple choice was on Cells and barely anything on the other stuff we went over. That f—ked me
One guy got a 26 😛
Then I get a 53...
I’m able to still get good grades with minimal studying; except for science.
*looks at Gummy*
Because reasons
I got a test to study for ~~that I’m not studying for~~
<:Nay:327308337706434570>

In final grades, that is
With 2 C’s and 1 D so far
Now, I’m a B student
I was an A student in high school
But it’s not my worst test in college. That would be a 45 in Economics
As I said earlier, I got a 53 on my Bio test
I know in my 1st pack of Pokémon cards, I got Mewtwo
🤔
👍
OHH
Oh

They said the ending was cringy
What would you give the movie?
Should they be trusted? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
IGN gave the movie a 5.8/10 and called it mediocre
Is that only in select theaters?
Oh
Where did you get that?
Another problem with mobile: sometimes the emotes won’t load unless you switch to another channel and back
Sometimes the colors take time to load
I didn’t even get a D. I just failed...

One person is playing through that Doki Doki Literature visual novel and others are in VC listening in
That is something that someone in the other server I’m in made

I wonder how Skarm feels about this? 🤔

*looks at Flubs* This sounds like something you would do
Hey, I didn’t put ketchup in there...
Anyways, I’m sure Deci would like that amount of cookies <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*squirts not water*
🔫
RC, come near them. I dare you
How many?
Good
And maybe have a cookie if the bot doesn’t steal it
Anyways, I think I want to play Battlefield 1
That’s useless

I guess Skarm really doesn’t like swearing so he does whatever he can to prevent it
Oh, I’ve seen that before

Small. But it’s like a medium at McDonald’s
Combo
$9.85 seems a bit much
Now, while I love the Baconator, I wish the meal didn’t cost so much
Oh
What’s a vod?
Anyways, how’s everyone today?
You know, for April 1st, I think I’ll just make a video of me eating a Baconator <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh hai
I’m back and SquidofBaconator is eating a Baconator
*shoves a Baconator down Gummy’s throat*
Go to Wendy’s then
You always invite/ask Dragonite to do stuff and he always says no. When will you learn? 😛
I NOMMED it because Gummy was being Gummy
Not always
😑
They’ll tell me to throw you out <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms coupon* I ate it. Now leave 😛
Gummy, I’d throw you out <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And I just like Baconators
People used to call me Squid(ward) in middle school because my voice was more nasally back then
Lol
I’d rather not say the exact place; privacy reasons
A local grocery store
I have to go to work in an hour
Ok

These are truly the important issues of our times
Meh, I didn’t stay long

*roasts marshmallows then*
Well, I still have an hour before I need to get ready for work and I don’t know what to do until then
Oh hai
👍
IDK
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
How is that racist?
You people...
😏
You don't need to be poking
*noms pokes*
Neither was I
🤔
Oh hai Andi
I know you're referring to Star Fox
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I honestly don't know what's going on right now; I just felt like using FlubsFish on Gummy
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
We do have seasons where it barely snows in the Winter and then it snows a lot in March and even early April
The only time I really like seeing snow is late December through January
I’m not sure how to feel about that
It’s actually going to snow here a little in a few
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rAlTOfl9F2w
I don’t really listen to them much 😛
The closest thing I’ve seen is the crossover with Ace Attorney
I never played a Professor Layton game
I know one guy who got a 14% on the 1st test <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
First time looking through it, I knew only a handful of the multiple choice. I did fine on the short answer though
As in, I knew less than I thought I did
Well, that didn’t go as I expected 😑
I’m just going to wing it like I always do
3 minutes 😛
In college
I do have 1 D and 2 C’s so far...
Yeah, I still do ok on most exams with a couple exceptions
As always, I barely studied because I didn’t feel like studying because laziness
Well, I’m hoping I do ok on my bio exam this morning
Hello you two
Morning
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
💀
Ok, since there’s a test tomorrow, I need to go to sleep a little early.

Good, Skarm didn’t steal it
Thanks for the sandwich guys
*noms lunch*
~~Who put it next to my bed?~~
It’s blaring in my ears
😒
I hear the Bullskitty alarm again...
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😒
Because it was just me and Draco
Yeah
I’m not sure if we even have any 4K TVs. Maybe one of them
And a lot of people still don’t have 4K televisions in their house so the huge focus on it is a little premature
And I believe it’s 720 in handheld mode, 1080 docked
Only occasionally a drop in frame rate
Yes. It runs very well
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I agree
It’s not bad
I can see why people like pixel art but it’s not my favorite style
Yeah
You can have a game that looks great, but if it keeps lagging, then it becomes annoying to play
Yeah
Shouldn’t we focus on getting to 60 FPS on most games first?
I don’t see why 4K gaming is such a big deal
I HATE THAT ARGUMENT
It is
And both Xbox and PS fans both agree to gang up on Nintendo because “THEY’RE FUR KIIIDS. THEY AREN’T 4K GAMING”
People still have their console wars
Idk Draco
*shrug*
In some parts yes
Which is what I have for it
And Xbox One
Look it up <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
The only problem I have is that the single player campaign could be longer
It takes place in WW1
Yes
Why yes I do <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
In conclusion, get Battlefield 1 instead of Overwatch <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Yep
I just played Battlefield 1. I still die a lot, but there’s enough people on the teams to carry my dead weight <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Like this one?
🔫
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
e!gummy-b
Screw Daylight Savings Time
I feel like I’m having trouble staying awake and it’s only 8:40 😑
I’m bored just like every other night 😛
Oh hai Will
🤢
Why?
Or a think-stroke
The washing machine and dryer... <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Doing laundry without falling down <:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>?
I don’t do much of anything
I’m a boring and lazy person
*3 UPVOTES AND ILL DELETE THIS MESSAGE* Like that Flubs? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Me irl is boring
He is
And I am a repetitive person irl
I don’t find those episodes funny
You calling me a moron? 😡
I’m Squidward
That’s what his answer will be
No
Isn’t Gummy at level 59?
😨
I had a dream about being in a horror game or something
~~supersquid64~~
Superman 64? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
I wonder where I die more: here or in Overwatch? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, something here needed to kill me...
💀
*noms the cane* Every time someone mentions it, I can’t help from nomming it...
Uhh... Skarm, why are you you?
Hey, that’s Animal Man’s thing <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
JA
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
I just put in an emoji
I deleted it, I think
You guys see that?
Good
Well, Skarm doesn’t want to say it
And that some of us don’t care about pc gaming <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
The tada is to me
🎉
And I’m a console peasant. Fight me
My notes include:



nothing
Sheep?
*noms the food*
I may go to all of my classes but I don’t pay attention 😛
Welcome to English Class with Master <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*pokes pokes*
A spoon isn’t going to do enough <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms pokes*
I don’t think it’s working 😛
I installed it
I see the *TAKE YOUR MEDS* alarm is going off...
🤔
Lol
😃
Don’t pay
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😏
Pancakes?
😐
Flubs, buy a burger or take one of his
e!gummy
Oh right
Idk
Why is everyone @ messaging me this?
No jefe
Isn’t it a Saturday though?
There have been a few people on different occasions who come into my place of employment who smell like weed
Why bother trying to fit in with them then?
Get some pancakes
~~That’s creepy~~
Good
Take those people outside too
e!gummy-b
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Thinking is for people who function like a human
🤔
Or you have a social life life not me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Especially if you have a job like me
They say you should study several hours a week for each class you take but that’s impossible
Screw it, I’ll just find stuff to look over tomorrow morning
A couple of these things, I don’t even remember seeing
Ok, looking at this review PowerPoint for my bio test tomorrow, I have concluded that I’m not going to remember all this info and that spending all night studying will be a waste of time so I won’t spend that long studying
I guess
🎉
🤔
And I’m going to eat dinner
I’m not doing that because I’m too lazy to go to my computer
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
Oh, it looks like the boat sank and Flubs is back from the cruise
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😏 because why not?
😏
Again
😏
So get Boat/Flubs to do it <@199725993416589313>
Oh Boooat...
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I should be studying for a test tomorrow but I’ just watching YouTube
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I have my Pokewalker somewhere
I used to love looking through those guide books that help me out through the Pokémon games
I have Pokémon Diamond and Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time guides
I have the Physical Skyrim Special Edition
Night Animal Man
It makes me feel like I actually own the games
I prefer physical copies over digital
I’m getting it for Christmas
😏
I have blocked a couple people on YouTube
I don’t think I’ve had to block anyone on Twitter
Sure, I can listen to that Draco
Lol
JA
YOU ACTUALLY THINK
I got distracted
☎
We’re a colorful bunch here
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
Yeah, this place did need cleaning up. I see a lot of dust <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I’m bored
HE SAID IT AGAIN
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
PROOF HE SAID THINK
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
<:ThinkingSteps:375845287547240448>
HE SAID THINK
Oooh
What?
No Draco. Anyways, I was going to say that one problem I have with Breaking Benjamin is that most of their songs sound too similar with little difference in them
Lol
JA
🤔
I know a song called The Red by Chevelle
I’m not sure if I have heard of them
I prefer other acts like Avenged Sevenfold, Slipknot, and Linkin Park
I haven’t really listened to most of their other music
I also like their latest song “The Resistance”
It’s pretty good
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1mjlM_RnsVE
I’m not using my mouth
I can’t keep up with the chat
Oh, and there’s a LOT more people there
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
WELL EXCUSE ME FOR TRYING TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
😑
Hey, I’m still here
The one I just joined
God, this server is something else 😛
“World War WAH”
“World War Z but instead of zombies it’s Waluigi.”
😛
Only one
Ok, I just joined another Discord server earlier today and right know, they won’t stop making Waluigi/WAH jokes 😑
Yes
And I just found out someone broke into my aunt’s house. Luckily, the cops caught him
Well I’m back
Wow 😛
Here
🛥
🤔
Why?
*noms something*
I know!
It happens when I do it randomly <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Nomming either solves my problems or kills me
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*noms insult*
Who you calling dumb?
I just like saying Meh
Meh
How do you exercise when your legs don’t always work well? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Gummy, what you find fun is a lot different than what our definition of fun is
😏
I’d rather go to Japan and become a weeb instead of going to Russia
I want to live somewhere where it isn’t too busy but I’m not that far from everything
Agreed RC
Morning RobotBoy
I just don’t want to go further north; it gets cold and snows enough here as it is
I don’t know where I would want to live
Unless you want to see Eyan <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Honestly, there isn’t much that would make you want to come to Pennsylvania.
Come to Pennsylvania: 90s in the Summer and 10s in the Winter
Just stay out of Canada <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Supposedly, we gain an hour of sleep yet I got the same amount 😐
Sit on your throne 🚽
I just don’t care for purple
I’m not sure I like it
SLEEP IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 🤔
Then yes. Probably
I’ll wait for that too. For rewatching
Ready to go outside? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t think most people pay attention to that stuff 😛
Well, including the pre-show
I believe it was 19 hours
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
So, Extra Life reached over $25K
Oh hai
🎉
Oh
🤔
I DON’T LIKE CHANGE <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Why did my color get changed?
And why am I PURPLE?!
Wait, Eyan really streamed at 2 in the morning?
Good night. I’ll check in the morning if the stream will still be going or if it ends sometime later tonight
Ok, I saw where the $700 donation went. I think I’m good to go to sleep
Jk. I’m not wasting my money on that
*proceeds to donate $1,337 for Elmo* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😏
My god, Stephen and Mal need to do more of these type of games 😛
I love how someone donated over $1000 at the last minute just to see them play Elmo <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
God, this stream is still hilarious 😛
By $7!
THEY’RE PLAYING ELMO!! 😂
Ok, I’m heading back to the stream after I check YouTube
e!gummy
So, what did I miss in Extra Life? Other than the 15k goal?
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
Well, I must get ready for work now. I’ll be back to the stream at around 9:30. Later Ninnies
Stephen is saying so many out of context sentences 
“I was hoping to ram you”
😏
Stephen is getting so upset 😛
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
MAL ACTUALLY HAS A BASS
🐟
This game looks just as bad as Superman 64. But better music
This is just hilarious 😛
Stephen’s forced southern accent is hilarious 😂
They haven’t started fishing and it’s already hilarious
🎉
It took him almost an hour to get caught up with donations 😛
I appreciate all the Squids in the chat there 🦑
The chat in the stream is crazy 🐟
WE DID IT
I’m still at my phone. Just not at the computer
Ok, I’m going to make dinner. I hope Bass Masters doesn’t get to $1000 while I’m gone
🎉
Why did everyone want this game again? 😛
FISH TIME
He’s been going on with telling donations for quite a while
👍
I hope some of these donations that are coming in go to the fish
$200 more to FISH2WIN
There’s still a lot of $50 donations coming in
I hope Bass Masters doesn’t get toppled 😛
There are so many donations 😂
I’m trying to save money right now
I didn’t want to donate too much; my parents would be mad if I donated $100 😛
Yeah
This is the first one I’ve been to and the first I’ve donated to
Yep
lol
YAY
I’m still waiting for my donation to be heard
A lot of small donations coming in now 😛
🎉
🤔
More rings <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, Superman 64 is still terrible and it’s funny watching Stephen struggle with it
And my little $30 one
They’re going to love all the $100 and $200 donations <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
Yeah
They haven’t updated the donations in a bit
I have to work later tonight so I won’t be here for some time. If he plays Bass Masters when I’m gone, I’ll be very disappointed <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
How long has he lasted in past years?
*shrug*
Yeah Regal, I saw that clip
Oh hai Will
I’d say hi there but there’s too many people 😛
Have you commented on this RC? I think I saw your name
I wonder if I’ll see my comment on the vlog. 
In that flood of comments <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
My donation feels small with all the $100 and $200 donations 😛
And I’m watching Extra Life too. I donated $30 to Bass Masters 2000
I’m back
~~Tricky Ricky~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And now, I must leave
Returning to quickly upvote the think
There’s always someone who says something along those lines <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔🤔🤔
THINK
It doesn’t have feelings <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*blows up pumpkin with the dynamite*
Meh
Good morning sleep
*sneaks over and takes some dynamite*
Oh, looks like he’s playing XCom
Boat, can I borrow some explosives? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ok, I just found out today is National Pumpkin Destruction Day
I didn’t know there was a new short 😛
Oh, I haven’t watched it yet
What one?
😡 And this is the face I make when I play Overwatch
Lol
😏

*noms* 🍪
There. I did it. I deserve a cookie

I used it exactly once
I know
Screw it. I’ll just go to my computer if I want to take a screenshot
I’m on mobile...
<:Senate:308758612455587841>

I didn’t know boats tumbled <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Are you talking about XCom?
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>

*shrug*
Mix of optimism and pessimism
I’m a realist
Yeah
Maybe I’d have what Slaking’s ability is since I’m lazy 😛
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Maybe. I eat a lot, so Gluttony?
No, I sleep
I wonder what my ability would be...
Aww, the steps are back to normal...

*shoots tranquilizer dart at wolverale*
See ya later
JA
And I don’t feel like 🤔 about it so I’m going to sleep
I don’t really get what Master was saying 😛
What?
If I stay home, I’ll watch Stephen’s stream
I don’t know if I’m going anywhere tomorrow
: |
Why?
😒
Also, his name is Calvin
🤔
Don’t you mean “Port” and “Starboard” if we’re using boat terms <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
If so, I’m donating <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Is there a Barbie game on the N64?
I remember watching the memorable moment of Mal putting jewelry on Stephen to play the Barbie game 😛
This would be the first time I make it to one of these
If I’m home. I was also thinking of donating some money if I make it
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Monster trucks + train = comedy gold 😛
I just watched that
I’ll just do whatever
It’s why we have that command
That’s your job

I’m bored 😑

Well, I’m done doing homework. I didn’t do one thing but I don’t give a damn
Gummy, I'm busy. Get someone else to handle this <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
What did you expect from ~~Flubs~~ Boat?
I've been working on my work for the past half hour
There is no time left for me to procrastinate
Well, I want to get my work done tonight so I must do it now
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I need to do online classwork that I always do the night that it's due
e!gummy
I still have to do homework tonight 😑
I’m hungry. I think I want 🥞
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
We have that Amazon Fire but I don’t use it
I don’t even have Netflix
I know I do it in a joking way a majority of the time but I honestly feel these teams are made to be weighted
How am I supposed to get better when I’m constantly put on teams that stand no chance?
It’s honestly ridiculous with how these teams are 90% of the time, weighted against me
I’m playing Overwatch now. Still losing...
🤔
...
Why are you bringing that up?
Yes. Why?
I might play League one of these days. But not in the near future
I still don’t know League talk <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t get why anyone would take that quiz. I’m pretty sure there are plenty of better quizzes out there
<@199725993416589313> Why were you taking that stupid quiz?
I just looked at it; that quiz was REALLY stupid...
Wait, why did Gummy take a quiz like that?
See ya Kugal
The only time I didn’t was when we had to do a stop motion video. I HATED that.
I swear, in high school, the only 2 classes I REALLY cared about were the video making ones
Barely anything interests me
I just don’t really care about 90% of subjects in general
But for now, I need to study for a Bio test Tuesday
Since I didn’t have to go to Statistics today, I will probably forget everything that we just did, until the test Friday
Math: no one remembers it the day after you learn it
Lol
I don’t usually pay attention to vocab at all
And also sine, cosine, and tangent problems
I remember that my math class in high school was just like that when we were learning proofs
I probably will.
Well, I didn’t have to go to class today and now I’m already bored 😛
👍
And pancakes are good too
I’m mostly referring to people outside of here
Squids and Baconators are where it’s at
People are overrated
Lol
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
🎉
Well, there’s my Daily Death right there...
There
*noms matches*
Computer joke:
What kind of doctor fixes websites? A URLologist
After Potassium got asked to do something, he replied: K
I wish I could think of a joke right now
😛
Lol
I don’t get that one
It’s going to take a lot more than that <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😐
I come back to chemistry jokes <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
I feel like I have less interest in doing anything; very few things excite me anymore
Mentally, that is
I’m not sure how I have been recently
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I guess
What happened Boat?
That’ll move you up fast
Be like me and our Head Maid: have just about no life and be on here almost all the time <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Really close now
I’m just waiting to pass Dragonite and be 4th here
😑
~~and make him play the game Battleship~~
~~Report Boat to the Battleship military~~
😐
Oh hai RC
Yeaaah, not happening
*makes a video about politics and stuff* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, I don’t know what to do now

Battleship
Lifeboat

Boat
I want a cookie
*noms toilet* Does that make it so we owe no money? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms*
I don’t really care about many shows right now
If I wanted to watch it, I would've started a while ago
I'm on Season 0
I still haven't watched a single episode
Meh
😐
I'm a SquidofBaconator

Take your meds
You are a Sylveon
No
That's Animal Man's money

I don't make money off my videos so it never hit mine 😛
I already did that joke last night <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
JA
🤔
And not die?
I'm pretty sure your singing would just consist of your usual earrape noises
I'm talking about your name <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
He did it last night
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Moral of the story: GO TO SLEEP
Lol
Sleep is for the weak.
*proceeds to sleep*
<:ThinkingSteps:373976837463867392>
*impatiently waits for Boat’s response*
Does Boat hate think like Flubs?
🤔
I see Flubs is still Boat
*sigh*
Well, I’m tired. I get 8 hours, I don’t do that much over the day, yet I usually feel tired.
🤔
Is this your first pinned message? 😛
I’m in the middle, leaning towards the fast side a little
People here either drive really slow or really fast
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
There’s a mix of laid back and asshole/aggressive drivers here
Just places most people have and local restaurants
We don’t have many places to eat; variety.
Northeast part of Pennsylvania.
I really wish I didn’t live in the middle of nowhere...
Ok, one that’s currently up is in Scranton PA; I think that’s a little closer
That’s over 2 hours away from me
Let’s see: it looks like the closest one (Chick Fil A) that’s coming soon will be in Syracuse and/or Rochester, NY
We don’t have a Chick Fil A near us and my parents had Popeye’s once and they thought I would’nt like it
I’ve never had either
~~Go to KFC tonight~~
🎉
I saw it
Did someone delete it?
Adobo?
I like fries
🎉
God, I wish time could go by faster right now. The sooner Bio lab can start, the sooner it can end. Which leads to me getting home early and doing nothing there
Life
We live such interesting, eventful lives <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Anything else happen other than the nosebleed? 😛
I brought my Switch but I don’t feel like playing it
So I’ve just been watching YouTube for quite a while
I still have 25 minutes before I have to go to Bio Lab
Well, your day is officially more eventful than mine 😛
👍
Was it an anime style, over the top nosebleed? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh hai Dan
Most of the shows aren’t good anyways <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
And so, the 2 hour wait for Bio lab begins once again. Only on ZealTV <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Ok, I’m heading out for the night 😴
You still look like Boat
~~Angry Jesus?~~
e!gummy-b
You’ll settle for anything? So stick figures are allowed? <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
I can do stick figure art <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
e!gummy
*noms marshmallow*
What would my awful nickname be? 🤔
~~SuperGumboing~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Oh hai
~~Stuck In A Boat~~
🎉🎉🎉
I doubt you actually took that course 😒
I’M ON A BOAT
~~Someone change his name to boat~~
🤔
🚢
Whatever boats your boat
I’M ON A BOAT
I like Green Day
Oh please. You know nothing about music
Meh
Sound of silence? Ok <:Kappa:374346980136058893> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4
Ok, why the hell are you still calling him Stuckypoo? It’s really f—king weird
*marches out*
This is what I do when I’m bored; nomming everything in sight
😏
*noms the Squid cane*
😐
😏
~~nomming more stuff?~~
💀
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
THERE
I usually have my water gun handy. When did I get a real one?
😐
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I’ll get the water for the 🔫
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
*locks the barrel*
And you’re just a Flubs who is stuck in a box
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
I don’t even know what’s going on 😛
😏
Wait, did someone poison another again?
*Insert Flubs saying SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEEAK here*
I have trouble finding the people on the other team and when I do, I die before I can see them
Well, I’m already bored from this game
I don’t remember if they were any good
Yes
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Anyways, I’m playing Battlefield 1 now
These aren’t that weird
😐
A bunch of angry idiots
I’m just watching Road Rage videos
I see Flubs has returned to downvote the think
<:ThinkingSteps:373976837463867392>
Well, I just finished my homework. Now what should I do...
Did someone flip off the lightswitch on the sun too early? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
This was SquidofBaconator's random thought of the night <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I had a hard time lifting my arm; it felt like I lifted it a little, but when Iooked at it, I haven't even moved it
Actually, yesterday when I was trying to wake up from a nap, I could tell my body felt heavy, like it wasn't ready to start moving; like if you randomly woke up in the middle of the night. I only recently just realized what that feeling is 😛
Did you bite it?
I don't think it's happened to me
Sorry I’m 17 minutes late. I was watching YouTube 😛
Oh hai Prince
🎉
I’m back from work once again
Oh hai Will. I’m fine
🤢
*noms all my candy before anyone takes it*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
I prefer eating cookies and junk in that area
I don’t even eat that much candy
I don’t know why my mom gets so much
Also, look at how much candy we still have from Halloween 😐
Stuck? What about him? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*says sleep is for the weak but then proceeds to go to sleep* <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
See?
That gets him out
Just 🤔
Ok, I’m going to head out for tonight
~~SuperFlubsying~~
🤔
😏
I doubt it would <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Brb
Oh
Gummy with a GIRLFRIEND?!
😑
He’s Flubs again
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>?

🤔
ALL THE KAPPAS
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
It looks more like lime Kook Aid
😒
I’ll show you tomorrow
We have a lot of candy because my mom bought way too much
Hi. I don’t trick or treat
Instead we have weird comedy music
The Television show. I have Seasons 1-7 on DVD
They happened a lot in the Office
“ That’s what she said” jokes are where it’s at
😨
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Isn’t that supposed to be tea?
This music 😐
😒
Did you try restarting Discord?
JA
🤔
Did you see that I could see you in VC?
See? It shows you are in VC

It says you are
Can you hear us Flubs?
Link?
What?
😐
🤔
Does milk have them?
I know what electrolytes are. I was wondering why you mentioned them...
What?
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Use Magic to turn it into milk
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
But it’s late and I’m not getting out of bed
If I was at my computer, I could actually do something decent
🏀
IM ON MOBILE. I CANNOT DO MUCH OF ANYTHING HERE
Ironic because I mentioned being repetitive

Now Skarm isn’t as repetitive as he was
At least we have a wider variety of quotes now
😐
I ate some today
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Didn’t you say You’re Gummy?
I thought you were Gummy
Idk, that Flubs guy
🤔
~~You pulled your leg off?~~ <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
And Flubs...
I know; I tried
You better delete that; they don’t like it when we speak in Spanish here 😛
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
JAJAJAJAJA
That means you have to not mind the <:ThinkingSteps:373976837463867392>
WHOEVER YOU ARE
OH HAI ~~FLUBS~~ GUMMY
2 quotes about Gummy 😑
*holds a 🔫 up to Skarm* GIVE BACK MY COOKIE.
😡😡😡
I think I want a cookie or something
😐
Yes 😏
Nomming it is more fun <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
There, nomming it fixed the all caps
*NOMS CAPS LOCK*
LOUD NOISES
YOU RUINED THE ALL CAPS
I WAS QUOTING ANCHORMAN
I DON’T KNOW WHAT WE’RE YELLING ABOUT
YOU’RE TOO SLOW
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
THEN WHY AREN’T YOU HATING ON THE THINK?!! YOU’RE DOING A BAD JOB AT BEING FLUBS!!
Hmm...Flubs isn’t around. If he was here, he would join in on the fun
JA
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
*noms nomming giggles*
It wouldn’t be a day in the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™ without me dying because of nomming something
Meh, there was just junk mail an- 💣 💀
*takes mailbox away from Gummy and noms it myself*
Hey, that’s mine and Dragonite’s job
What about a mailbox?
😏
If only Eyan was still doing YouTube; I wonder what stupid stuff he would say now 😛
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
How many quotes does Skarm Bot have now?
“I HAZ FACEBOOK” - Eyan 2010. Well, it’s very easy to find funny Eyan quotes while rewatching HeartGold 😛
The principal needs to get his eyes checked
I agree RC
Did no one tell him to put pants on?
😏
Again
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
That has nothing to do with what I said
You can’t be Flubs...
You’re supposed to hate the think
You failed the test
🤔
What Master?
This is stupid. And not the good kind.
😐
Here’s some Taylor Swift for ya https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk
He must listen to a lot of Taylor Swift if he wants to be Gummy
And I will....idk
JA
🤔
<@335818633030795264> Now’s not the time for that
Oh hai Flubs
Well, I don’t know what to do now
e!gummy
😐
LE GASP
😱
<:ThinkingSteps:373976837463867392>
😃
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t really like watching many streams
Oh hai Dan
Wake Him Up When September Ends
New profile pic 😃
🕘
🤔
Perfect
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Ok
*hits Gummy with a golf club*
Brb. Video gaming
It’s poisoned
Oh hai Animal Man
Sigh
💀
Eww
That was a bit of a delay Skarm
e!gummy
Yeah
🚪 Go
“Stuckypoo”
*throws Gummy in the box that Flubs is in and locks it*
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Gummy* SLEEP
I think Gummy mistook a Baconator for me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I don’t think I even moved
I know. It doesn’t have water in it. 😏
*squirts water at Gummy again*
🔫 Stop
I’m not paying attention to where I am <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*continues to just play HeartGold* I’m leveling up Zubat so I can actually get good moves on it
I’m not hungry
*squirts water at Gummy* no
🔫
I’ve never heard of them
I have my own non-poisoned candy. *noms it before someone poisons it*
It’s all poisoned...
There’s a bomb in there!
💣
*continues to play HeartGold*
Liar
HOW MUCH POISON DOES GUMMY HAVE?!!
More poison...
He’s going on a killing spree
If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime
😐
Well, I die every day here, so...
Gummy, stop killing everyone!
😒
As always
💀
*5 seconds later* Well, it looks like we’re holding another funeral
Yeah
Too much going on in the background
I’m not sure I like that
Is he still around?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
😐
Why? You have to give out your candy? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Anyways, how are ya Chewy?
:pumpkin: And there isn’t a pumpkin emote <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Oh hai Chewy
Oi
~~Stuck’s legs don’t work well. That’s new~~ <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I just leave to eat dinner and I still come back not knowing what the hell is going on here
What?
🤔
No, nomming his cane is my thing
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Thanks
I always end up going to bed at the same time
The thing is, even if I nap, that won’t make me stay awake longer
I ended up sleeping for over an hour 😐
Anyways, going back to our holiday discussion, I think this video is appropriate https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FAY0U9gjf_0
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Who doesn’t like him that way back
He also likes Gummy 😏
He’s a guy who hates 🤔
I had to say it since Flubs isn’t around <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Flubs: STOP THINK
🤔
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
SOMEONE SAY WENDYS?!!!
WHO THE HELL WANTS CHRISTMAS STUFF UP IN AUGUST?!!
A couple years ago, I went into a Hobby Lobby with my mom and they had Christmas trees up. IN AUGUST
Pfft
I like A Christmas Story but TBS doesn’t need to air it 24 hours straight
Ok, I see that Hocus Pocus is being played all day on a tv channel. Is it becoming the “A Christmas Story” of Halloween?
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Again
On Sunday, we lost power for a second but internet and cable were out for a couple hours
I really hate losing my internet connection randomly...
I just don't think about it
I don't usually send friend requests to...almost anyone
That's...random
😐
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Ok, I connected it. What does that do?
How do you do that? Attaching a YouTube channel, that is
I didn’t know that
😐
No, it’s a Baconator
🎉
Same name here
Once I’m done with this video uploading, I think I’ll continue with HeartGold
Something Nintendo?
Shit, I forgot to make the thumbnail 😑
Meh
Although, I could live without waiting a while for it to finish exporting and uploading to YouTube...
Well, I finally got another video edited and exporting. It always feels good to finally finish a video.
*noms*
Meh
And here I am
Like right now “This is boring. What’s happening online?”
I’m always thinking about something else when I’m bored
Same here
I just zone out
Like just about every day in Biology
I’m bored and I’m having trouble listening
Around 20 more minutes of this <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I really should be paying attention more in this class but meh
I’m SquidofBaconator
Happy Halloween everyone
Gummy, just go for it 😏
I never listened to them
😏
Well I can’t help you there. I don’t listen to death metal
😐
Avenged Sevenfold?
I listen to rock but not a lot of metal
This could be ZealTV’s soap opera: “Flubs and Gummy: *insert funny subtitle here*”
Because you love Flubs
You people keep trying to kill me. Is there a grudge against me or w-💀
What the hell is that?
🤔
“SLYTHERIN”
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I removed it with magic
*noms Baconator after removing the Cyanide* Nice try
*throws it at Flubs* Here, you can have it
😐
🤔
*noms it anyways* I doubt he wanted it anyways
Not safe for the FeelsGoodMan?
😐
Lol
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
So, nothing like you? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
😏
*noms door* There. Fixed.
That doesn’t help your case you bot...
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
Writting? Is that like writing? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Great job Ida
🎉
Oh
What?
😐
ZealTV needs to allow me to do something different for my show <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Well, it looks Like SquidofBaconator’s nightly “I’m bored” time is starting again...
Ok, now please say that again in English <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
Did you downvote the Meh?
What, you’re downvoting that too now?
😐
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Quiet you
Would that be a good Skarm quote?
“In case you aren’t familiar with my videos, your probably thinking that my videos are lame” - Eyan 2010
😛
Anyways, I want to see how the Let’s Play holds up. I know the bad camera quality is obvious, but I want to see how everything else still goes
I remember seeing that
Since I’m playing HeartGold, I kind of want to go and watch Eyan’s Let’s Play of it
Next time, I’m keeping track of how many times I win and lose myself; I’m really curious about it
Best to end on a high note
And with that, I’m done with Overwatch for tonight
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I WON A MATCH IN OVERWATCH!!!
I FINALLY DID IT!!!
REALLY F— KING AWESOME
EVERYTHING IS AWESOME
It’s good to see my losing streak in Overwatch is STILL going on. It’s great that, no matter what I do, I will never be able to win
What’s the pattern?
I see Flubs is still lurking
🤔
💀
I better not have nommed Stuck’s cane again...
So... *noms something for the hell of it*
But I’m not going to <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I think I could live longer if I stopped nomming things
I’ve nommed it so much that it doesn- 💀
I’m immune to Cyanide now
How many are there now?
*noms cookies anyways* I know someone had them
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I did it. Can I have a cookie? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And there’s me up voting the think to counteract the downvote as usual
The emote?
🤔
<:Kappa:374346980136058893>
~~Let’s end all of our messages with lol now~~ lol
😏
F—K IT. IT AIN’T COMING OUT
I don’t know where my dad keeps his tools
Meh
I CAN’T GET THIS COVER OUT SO I CAN RECHARGE MY PHONE. AAAAAAH
Anyways, I got an hour until I eat. Should I continue replaying HeartGold or get pissed off at Overwatch?
Lol
Prince, go 🚪
They get so popular
<:Yep:318920218279673856>
Why do they get so many views?
Diss Tracks and rapping are ~~the future~~ just awful
Because if you make them, then you’re them, according to people. I won’t go into this any more since it’s dipping into political territory
Because “NAZI JOKES ARE ABIG NO NO”
I watched PewDiePie before 10 million
When they react to modern music, there’s always a couple kids who are like “OMG I LOOOVE THIS SONG AND THIS ARTIST!! I LOOOVE IT!!”
Their videos feel very repetitive
Scratch that: Smosh has never been relevant to me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
I never watched Smosh
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Thank you Flubs. That tells me absolutely nothing
What is going on...
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
It’s a restaurant that you might know for their root beer
Oh, and btw. The A&W I ate at for lunch? It was mediocre
After almost 5 hours of riding and driving
I finally made it back home
To order
It was a bit of a pain 😛
I’m eating now
I’m eating at an A&W that’s made to look like an old diner and how you order your food is you pick up a phone at the table to order
This is really weird...
Well, class time. See you in several hours <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😒
Yesterday it wouldn’t stop raining. Today, it’s windy as f— k
It was supposed to get delivered to a dealership near them but then the people who have it said that he has to go pick it up
It’s halfway across the state
My dad needs to go pick up a truck for where he works and I’m riding up with him and then I’ll have to drive back while he takes the truck
No, school then something else
Anyways, today’s going to be a really long day 😑
I don’t think anyone knows 🤔
Now I really am leaving. Good night Ninnies
*noms the rock* Good, my 10pm snack
And on that note, I’m going to bed early. I got a long day ahead of me tomorrow
😏😏😏
A rock meant to look like sugar cane? 😛
But I don’t know what exactly is in the rock
Something that will probably kill me <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
*noms rock* I ate it
It’s a rock isn’t it Gummy?
Yea emote
Any sane man thinks
🤔
Yes
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
So, you’re both asleep and awake kind of?
Oh
Please explain what exactly that is RC
I see Flubs is downvoting the think again
I know <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
🤔
That’s going to go off no matter if you turn it off or not 😛
The Bullskitty alarm? <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
And I ran out of things to talk about
I have nothing to say
Meh
Maybe Gummy
I’m not sure what I would even want to go to
I also don’t do well in crowds
I do have money. I wouldn’t waste it to go to a convention but I have it
I’m sure a lot of people don’t know what net neutrality is and don’t care to learn
Worth it Gummy
😐
I think I’ll watch one guy’s stream of Super Mario Oddessy
To think or not to think
🤔
I’m surprised Flubs hasn’t jumped out of the bushes to yell “STOP THINK” at us yet

I don’t use Snapchat or Instagram or any of those stupid social media sites that most people just use to ~~send nudes~~ Take pictures
No

OK I WILL *goes outside and gets struck by lightning*
Get a flashlight
Make snow angels. Go sledding
Going outside <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
I know on the 3rd, I don’t have class or work that day so... 3 DAY WEEKEND!!
Wait, there is one thing that I decided to not even do <:Kappa:374346980136058893>
🤔
I don’t have homework! I think...
And that’s my cue to copy these two and not do anything else
*noms deep fried egg*
😐
They need to be on a breakfast sandwich or something
I don’t like eggs by themselves
Or just regular stove top pans? <:Keepo:327304799919800321>
Cast iron pans?
Just find someone you love and if you feel ready, then go ahead
I agree

And back
And tomorrow, I have to drive across half of NY
It started last night and it hasn’t stopped
Random thought: It hasn’t stopped raining here since last night
I just got here
I didn’t
I’m back from work ya Ninnies
🤔
Overwatch is OVERrated 😛
Meh
Yay...
Well, tomorrow I’ll be making a trip halfway across the state and back
I was about to just go to sleep when it came back on two minutes ago
God, I was really getting bored...
My power goes out for one second, the Internet goes our for 2 hours 😑
Alright, I’m going to sleep
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
They’re supposed to be salty yet I feel like they need more salt 😛
Salt potatoes are overrated; they are very bland.
I like baked potatoes, especially loaded ones with bacon and cheese. I was referring to boiling them (like salt potatoes)
I’m a very picky eater
I don’t like eggs and pickles, boiled potatoes are my least favorite kind of potato, and I’ve never had kalbasa
I don’t think I’d like that
What is that?
Or share with us? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Are you going to show us Master?
Because that’s what his name says?
Because you can call him both names?
Because I do?
I’d rather have pumpkin bread
I hate their taste
I hate bananas
For 1 penny
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
It’s very ridiculous; how many channels you’ve gotten rid of
🤔
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*noms Dragonite’s bad habit of poking stuff and poking in general*
e!gummy
You better quit <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I don’t like that
Mainly because I found out you can’t find out your win percentage or win loss ratio
I just got finished getting frustrated at Overwatch again
Oh hai Will
Oh
Mv?
😐
It tells me Games won but not my losses
Is there a way to check your win-loss ratio in quick play? Because I haven’t found it
I know I do it in a joking way a lot but it honestly upsets me with how bad I am with Overwatch
😡😡😡
I’M TERRIBLE AND I WILL NEVER GET BETTER
I GET IT IM TERRIBLE AT EVERYTHING
4 teammates are always dead at the same time
It’s always going to be like this?
I can’t be on a good team...
I’ve never had this much trouble with any game before...
Seriously, why am I having so much trouble just trying to win once?
I’m going to play Overwatch and lose my mind
*noms Dragonite’s dumb comment*
And I wish I could have a nice discussion over the genre but people either just ignore me or ostracize me for liking music that isn’t cool
Stuff from people/bands like Sam Hunt, Old Dominion, Keith Urban’s material for the past year or two, Thomas Rhett, and any person who makes pop music and ruins what reputation the genre has left; very little
I’ll admit: quite a few of the newer stuff, I hate or don’t like
Only because “It’s country and it’s not cool to like country”
News flash: THERE’S CLICHES IN ALL MUSIC. I get really tired of people putting so much focus on country music cliches while ignoring all the cliches of other genres
I’ve heard that
How to get the chat silent: talk about country music
His music is nowhere close to country and his popularity and influence have been terrible for the genre
Sam Hunt is particularly awful
I hate a good amount of the stuff that’s played on the radio
I’m used to most people disliking my music
Flubs just doesn’t like music
No one likes the music that I like...
Yes
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1mjlM_RnsVE
Does that help?
*looks at Flubs*
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Not as much but still
I use the 🤔 emote even when Flubs isn’t around
Meh
Meh
I’m talking to Dan
What’s your problem with 7?
Well then...
JA
What?
🤔
MEDS
🎉🎉🎉
*noms something* Wait, Did I nom your cane again?
I’ll nom anything
*noms broken heart* I don’t care
~~Dan is a cannibal~~
😨
I say 3 or 4 downvotes mean take it down
No
🎉
<:ThinkingSteps:373976837463867392>
Oh you updated the thinking steps
What’s it called?
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Eyan, stop staring into my soul.
I want to start playing All Star now 😛
SHREEEEK
It’s almost like Eyan is staring into my soul. Is that a good or bad thing?
😐
I’m not an action movie person
Is the badge like that emote?
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
A badge for what?
ME
You can’t say Stop Think. Only Flubs, Animal Man, and Fulbs can do that
Also, Dan
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
JA
🤔
😏
Why are you doing that?
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😏
What will you be eating?
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I’m referring to when you use it regurally
HE DID IT AGAIN
FLUBS SAID THINK. HE JOINED OUR SIDE
THINK 🤔🤔🤔
Anyways, how are ya doing Dan?
That don’t work well
The Draco Bot had a malfunction <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Good
Dan=Stuck?
Oh hai Dan
REMEMBER
Sigh
I’m just Squid
😐
Sigh, children
It was just an infomercial. Not many people watch those anyways <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I’m not sure how much I like learning
I still feel like this every time someone mentions League
What is that?
🎉
It’s right next to the Bullskitty alarm
I hear the “FLUBS FORGOT HIS MEDS” alarm going off
I also wonder how this started
Enjoyment?
I get too much enjoyment out of Stuck’s hatred towards thinking <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Saw that
🤔🤔🤔
YOU THINK
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
In what?
ZealTV isn’t dead yet!
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
“Gummy’s Dating Tips”...How did this get an infomercial?
Let’s see: who’s show will I be replacing
WELL I’M CHANGING THE SCHEDULE
Well, it looks like SquidofBaconator’s daily “I’m Bored” time is starting early 😑
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Then I’d know what the few Hispanic people who come into the place I work at are saying 😛
I just wish I remembered more Spanish then I do now
Meh
My Spanish is terrible despite me taking 4 years of it
I don’t remember any of it
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
You would also love the future tense in Spanish
More pins 😃
Well, one thing I’ll say right now: “thats why I was remove” should be “That’s why I was removed”
I could pick it apart but I don’t think it would be appreciated <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I see that
But aren’t you in love with France?
It was a class I actually got something out of
That’s it
I didn’t care about anything except Video Production
I don’t care as long as I get a B
People just cared too much or didn’t care at all in my high school
😐
What’s left of my social life was blown up
I had an average of around 96 and I still didn’t get into the top 10; it was VERY competitive up there
The worst part about science for me is always lab. I’m bad at hands on stuff
I didn’t even make it into the top 10.
In 11th grade, my grades were all good except for Chemistry; I hated it and I got a C in it.
And I kept all my grades above 90 in senior year
I was the only high schooler who kept his phone in his locker
I never carried my phone on me
Are you referring to texting or relationships
Say that to most high schoolers who are in relationships
You probably actually have stuff to do unlike me 😛
Meh
Sigh
No one has any respect for most classes
I feel like most kids are like that
Because kids in school can’t stop looking at their phones for 5 minutes
I saved you all a lot of reading
It’s about two people falling in love in the middle of 2 feuding families. They both end up killing themselves
It doesn’t matter too much what we read, I didn’t care about any of it
I just don’t like reading
It’s all boring to me
Yes
I hated those the most
I hope I don’t have to take any more English classes
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
“Who Killed Stuck’s Love For 🤔?”
Never heard of it
🤔
Gee, I wonder why he wouldn’t want to play...
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Yeah, unless you’re going into the army, you won’t need that
<:Yep:318920218279673856>
There is almost never anything on tv anymore
😐
Learn to hone your detective skills by searching the outside world
e!gummy

<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
<:FailFish:372152438355918848>
Totally not a waste of time
Moral of the story: Video games are amazing
What are you even talking about? I’m confused
I hear the Bullskitty alarm going off again
<:Treason:305563730056314880> skills?
Skills?
I’m thinking because Flubs can’t do anything about it when he’s on fire
I’m going to be doing a lot of 🤔 then
📷
🔥
It feels like I need to do something but I don’t think I have anything due...
😐
32...
😐
Why?
This is why you shouldn’t run out of meds
Also I never played that game
🤔🤔🤔
Does that mean I have no hp bars left?
Or you could be like me and Draco: be here all the time with no life <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
JA
🤔
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
You need magic to get that far fast
Meh
*noms*
Good now that I’m done with work for the day 😛
👋
I’m back. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be
Ok, time for work <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
🤔 🤔
FeelsLikeNotGoingToWorkThisEarlyMan
I have to be there at 7:30
This is also the earliest I’ve had to work
🎉
I really hate having to get to work before sunrise 😑
I haven’t been up this early in a long time
I don’t know what to do...
Sigh
This is honestly making me depressed; not our conversations, what my dad has said
I won’t be able to go to a convention. I can’t just spend my money like that and my parents definitely won’t approve in spending money on it
I wish I was exaggerating
He just sees his son wasting money on stupid games that will give you nothing physical to show for it
He doesn’t see any of this
I don’t think him and I will agree
With how much time I’ve spent gaming over the years, that’s implying a good chunk of my life is a waste
I’m honestly VERY offended
He thinks it’s all a waste
Not according to my dad
“It’s a waste of time”
One thing I didn’t mention: when I said to my dad that I’m not trying to buy more than one thing per month, he rolled his eyes. Seems like he just doesn’t like me spending money on games. Period. Except for probably once or twice a year
I don’t plan on playing
I don’t think I’ll be spending money on video games until after the holidays. I really don’t want to make my situation even worse
Good, because I’m not downloading Steam onto my computer again
Do you need Steam?
Oh
Also, now isn’t a good time to spend money on much since my dad has really been on my case
Eh
I’m surprised I haven’t even thought of trying it out
Man, League is really popular here.
What are you talking about?
Oh hai Majestic
And I’ll....probably watch a movie or something
😐
Flubs ran out of one of his meds
Should you call someone? Like a doctor or something?
😐
Did you forget to take your meds Flubs?
Seems like people don’t want me doing any <:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
😐
I forgot what I was doing 😛
Wait, JA
To Master, they are
Do you know what goes into it?
And sooner than anything I’ll accomplish
😒
THERE’S ALWAYS A NINNY EVERYWHERE
So, who would be the class Ninny? Gummy or someone else?
<:Yep:318920218279673856>
The comedic relief kind?
Oh
What role do I have in the visual novel?
I’m glad I’m not involved in this friendship thing
😨
A lot of people die here 😐
*takes the money* I need this
You know nothing Gummy
Hey, back at my high school, there was at least 40 or more teenagers leaving at the end of the day at once
Rush our for us isn’t as bad as the city
~~Driving and crashing~~
Why did you let Fulbs out of the Dungeon?
Quiet you
NO
I’d only drive that short a distance if it was cold or raining/snowing outside
That seems pointless to drive just 2 minutes
🤔
Now your insides are on fire
It’s going to set you on fire if you’re still holding it
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
“Every time you sleep late Ida I’ll break it” Gummy doesn’t do violence anymore eh?
Bullskitty
So....how’s the weather?
😏
This rock could kick his butt in a fight
😒
And I don’t have work then so I’m happy 😛
I don’t have to go to class Friday 🎉
I like it too
I show up to all of my classes yet I only listen half of the time. The other half, I zone out
But I’ll see if that changes when the next tests roll around
I barely study at all yet I have at least B’s in all my classes right now
Lol
Yeah, why do you have a voodoo doll of me?
*throws it down the stairs*
*replaces the Squid doll with a Flubs doll*
*pokes the voodoo doll with 🔪*
🎉
Then you will fail
Do your work
I don’t watch JonTron. I’ve only seen a couple of his videos
He’s the king of being punny?
So, he’s very punny?
Deft?
Never heard of him
Like kid shows that try to be legitimately funny and clever by overusing bad puns?
Go home Chugga. You’re drunk
🚪
Ok, what am I doing with my life? I’m watching a guy eat 50 scrambled eggs 😐
I think I might get drunk after I drink one or two beers for the first time 😛
So, how drunk are you?
🤔
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Yeah
Secretly?
This is getting annoying
Yes
*goes back to finishing homework*
😒
You
Flubs... <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
hey Gummy. I still have a YouTube channel.
~~MAKE GUMMY JEALOUS~~
God, the websites that my college uses are really slow...
I'll just try going to sleep a lot earlier than I usually do. I don't like taking drugs except for the one that I'm prescribed
WHY CAN'T I JUST GO TO SLEEP. I HAD A LONG DAY. AND I NEED TO WORK AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING. AAAAHHH
And I think I’m starting to get a headache. Yay...
Eh, whatever. I need to get to my Psychology work. Even if I just want to sleep right now
I think he doesn’t really “get” the games that I play if that makes sense
When I was younger we played games like Mario Kart, Wii Play and Wii Sports Resort a lot more
It’s been a couple. Last time was with Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U
Not in years.
He acknowledges that’s it’s my money and I can spend it how I want but he disapproves buying a lot of video games
Yeah
I really hate this and him saying stuff when I know most of it already is pretty irritating
He said he wasn’t angry but I could tell he was probably mad at me
He thinks I have nothing to show for it
Again, he thinks it’s a waste of time and he doesn’t like helping me pay for stuff like college while I’m just buying video games
I usually make at least $450 a month and I try to not go over $70
🤔🤔🤔
Uhh...any thoughts? Is buying a game a month too much?
I don’t think he really gets it
He just thinks it’s a waste of time
It’s not like I’m taking all of my money and blowing it instantly
While we’re talking about money, if you didn’t see me say this yesterday, My dad talked to me last night about money and saving it and not spending it all on video games and blah blah you get the idea...
So the fun of Mario Party is gone? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
🤔
I like orange juice. The drink
Shit, I’m late to it. GO PLAY OUTSIDE GUMMY
Moral of the story: People suck
And if you’re too happy, she’ll complain about that
I know one old woman who complains a lot to us; we’re never doing a good enough job for her. She said some stuff about me like how I’m terrible because I never smile.
If I ever see her, I just want to tell her “Go f—k yourself you g— damn bitch”
I get that from my dad
I just have a very monotone voice and it looks like I’m always mad about something
Pfffffffft
So, quite a few people ask if we’re open and I always get the urge to reply, “No, I just like standing here.”
We don’t even have signs at where I work
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Hi
😑
I’m back from a long day of college and work. And I STILL have homework to do
GOOD NIGHT
Steve was the main guy in the children’s show, Blues Clues. It aired on Nickelodeon in the early 2000s
I’m not Steve. I was never on Blues Clues <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
😐
Ok, I think that’s a good stopping point for being here tonight
We don’t need to know about catheters
Too much information
TMI Flubs
Well, humans have to do that to function
:pondering:
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
What?
Use <:FlubsFish:371860042430808065> as the steps?
Plesae doo
Like what?
Hmhmhm??mm
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
🤔
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Ok, I admit it! I like chocolate!
I told you everything
Lol
I’m mad because you always forget them
I’m not mad at you for needing them
It’s always meds with Flubs...
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
And now, SquidofBaconator’s nightly “I’m bored” time is beginning
*noms nomming gummy*
He’s either just going to say no or say it while being violent to you
No
Quiet you
😐
Good, Skarm didn’t steal it
Next thing you know, he’ll steal my sandwich
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Die
DAMMIT SKARM
*pets pit bull* This Dog is very nice to me <:Kappa:305551256104206336>

My favorite pumpkin product is a pumpkin roll
Pumpkin is good too.
My mom makes a great apple pie
I like pie
I did have garlic bread yesterday
*noms it all*
Yeah
Turkey is good though
I can’t eat ice cream; I vomit from it
A burger, fries, a slice of pizza, a cookie, and root beer
You know what I had for lunch,
Yeah, it should be VERY obvious not to take health food advice from me 😛
Eat healthy
No
e!gummy
Gummy, that’s stupid.
I’ll se you people later
I’m not doing this to provide entertainment
For now
Then I’m leaving
😒
Sorry if this annoys any of you, I just need to vent and I don’t have many places to do so
😡
This shit really angers the f—  out of me
It feels like he’s overblowing it
It’s not like I’m taking my check every week and blowing all that money away
I’m not in a joking mood anymore
I am
I don’t give a shit
Well, my dad just talked to me about money and spending it on games and life and BLAH BLAH BLAH
I HAVEN’T WON IN THE PAST 10 MATCHES
LOOOOOSIIING
I’ll do it
At least those who play Overwatch
I HAVE NO FRIENDS
These guys play horribly
DOES NO ONE KNOW WHAT A VIDEO GAME IS IN OVERWATCH
2 healers <:FailFish:372152438355918848>

HOORAY FOR LOSING
YAY IM LOSING AGAIN
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>

Guys, I think I’m making a mistake: I’m playing Overwatch
I use the emote, you come in and use it 😛
Every time
It’s birthday magic <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
🎉
Good, Skarm didn’t steal the cookie
*gives Dan a birthday cookie*
🍾
🎉
You talk funny
British people are too easy to make fun of
WAR: WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR
😏
We’re in the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™ There’s only Ninnies here
But Flubs IS a Ninny; everyone here is a ninny
Thinking is for smart people
🤔
I meant 😐
Wrong emojis
Quiet you
If Skarm doesn’t steal it
In 8 minutes, I’ll give you a cookie for your birthday
I found out earlier that tomorrow, it’s Keith Urban’s birthday; he’s a pop country artist
🎉
Is it poisoned?
What kind of candy?
Oh hai Dan
Sigh
“Why didn’t you ask me about this earlier?”
“I didn’t look at it until last night” 
Him: <:FailFish:372152438355918848>
You see the problem here?
And he’s already annoyed at us for only one student doing a practice packet that we were going to go over Wednesday
Not many options...
We’ve had it for a week
It’s due tomorrow
So, I’m just not going to do it. Meh
Well, I did some of my homework. Some of it, I don’t know what to do
😏😏😏
Again
😏
What are they...
😐
*shoves meds down Stuck’s throat* There, that was fast
Social?
I honestly couldn’t look the pig in the face
You should’ve went into bio lab for me. We dissected pigs today
I need to do homework 😑
Mop
Meep
🤔
*throws more*
Ok, suit yourself. BTW, these are just rocks made to look like soccer balls
*throws soccer balls at Gummy until he goes outside*
e!gummy-b
Sooo....
Maybe if you went outside more, you would know more about your country 😏
So, you don’t know any other city in your country? 😛
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Do you know anything about your country other than its name?
I want all the cookies
😃
I want more
*noms cookies*
COOKIES?!
What is this Twitter...
Thank you Flubs for telling us the obvious 😑
I’m not sure 🤔
I don’t think I taste vinegar
😐
Ugh, I don’t like this aftertaste...
Yeah. I think it’s a little too strong
Bleh, I just tried it again. Bad mistake 😑
Idk what brand it is. I think they got it from Sam’s Club. The last time we got cider, it was from Wegmans; I loved that one
And I’m thirsty. I want some apple cider but I hate the stuff we got 😑
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
I survived the dissection
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
But, that’s a story for another time. I must go to Bio lab now
For a little while, it sucked
We got our most recent modem from Spectrum
I’m not sure if I heard of them
Frontier?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
...
Why did you have no internet RC?
🎉
~~Or people already think that~~
I’m sure when people see several lines of me just arguing with myself, they would think I’m as crazy as Flubs <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*Yeah, let’s do that* You don’t get a say in this
What can I do for that long?
10 more minutes...
~~I’m the~~ <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994> ~~of lines~~
~~I like lines~~
~~Lines through words~~
~~BurgerEclipse~~
I COULD start homework due tomorrow. But I don’t feel like it 😑
🍔
It gets very boring waiting for Bio lab for this long
Good, I got out a little early. Now the long wait for lab 😑
Still a half hour of this class 😴
Morning
I’m still dreading the dissection
Class is boring as usual
Good night Ninnies
Ok, I’m not waiting for Flubs to get back. I’m going to bed
It got cancelled before the 1st season ended
It’s a very boring show
“Just Squid and Gummy” only on ZealTV ™
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
*bombs Overwatch again for the hell of it*
👌
I’m bored
😐
No
I don’t even know what’s going on
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
MORE EARRAPE
*noms fear of long words*
I can’t say the whole word
Words words words
Japan?
😐
I don’t even know what that is
Yandere. I called Flubs that because he said the only way he knows to love is to wring your neck
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Flubs called me a weeb
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065> U
U
Hmmm?
This ™ is ™ weird ™ just ™ listening ™ to ™ Gummy ™
TM TM TM TM TM MT
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Using the <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994> emote is an easy way to get Draco here 😛
For no reason
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
FLUBS. HURRY UP
It’s mostly him talking to himself and me occasionally making comments
Just me and Gummy: this is weird
👍
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
~~Stuck In A Jackass~~
Oh
❓
“Not dying juice”
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Well, that was a fun stream
Silence. The worst joke
Someone tell me a joke
Well, I ran out of things I want to do, like every night
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*noms teaching*
😑
NEIN
JAJAJAJAJA
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
So contradicting?
Contrarian?
Lol
Wow...
I need one or my allergies would take over
STOP FORGETTING YOUR MEDS
I guess it was someone
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Who deleted it?
That's every show nowadays
Regular Show is great
Someone needs to stop the cult of thought hating from gaining influence
Again
*Take Stuck’s explosives and blows up Overwatch*
CANT THE SQUID HAVE FUN
THE NINNIES WILL ALWAYS BE ON MY TEAM
*starts rampage*
AAAAAAHHH. DRACO SAID IT
No...
No
~~Like that one video game that shall not be named?~~
😑
KATY PERRY
😐
There are 2 people at my place of employment who share my birthday
JA
Wait, is his birthday today too? 🤔
Something called a bearded dragon
And I just found out my brother in law got a lizard for his birthday 😛
🎻
Well, usually it’s just me dying because of nomming stuff that isn’t food but it looks like I must die for Master to get the showdown
😐
*noms showdown*
Cookies!
I GAVE YOU CAKE
🤔
🍰
Oh hai Animal Man
That’s weird
😐
🥞
🎉
Hooray for still not knowing League talk
😒
Don’t get drunk
Sigh
Why?
😐
*judges*
Don’t judge me
🙃 nO I’M nOT
Just another day in the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
Or whatever Canadian drug you have to stop headaches
Or Advil
Take some ibuprofen Gummy
😏
Master, what the hell are you talking about?
North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica
Why the hell am I debating with Stuck’s logic...
That’s 4.
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
7 continents.
There’s only 5 major oceans right?
In other news, I just finished yet another assignment in which I bullshit the whole thing <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
You forgot the Pacific Ocean
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
1492
GO AHEAD
But now, all I have to worry about is dissecting pigs tomorrow 🤢
I haven’t really been getting the material that well
Although, I WILL have to study for the next Bio exam
Meh, all my grades so far are B’s so I’m fine
Is that bad? 😛
Actually, my Statistics professor got mad at us because only one out of 10 people did a practice packet. He says that it seems like no one is putting in any time outside of class
I’m not used to studying for long
And when we mentioned it here, Master said he would make it an emote 😛
He’s the Walkthrough Wizard
Seriously Gummy, just study and you’ll be fine
The new Kappa 😛
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
WHY DOES NOMMING KEEP KILLING ME
I’ll be f- 💀
Meh
*noms biology class* There, now I never have to deal with THAT again...
This assignment is stupid
A poodle?
Lol
™
This has been “Advice Time With Flubs”
I’m bad at multitasking
I’m watching YouTube right now
Meh
But not right now
I’m hoping to get that done fast
Tired. Got done with my job a little while ago and I still need to do an assignment for Bio tomorrow
Oh hai Will
Although, I don’t like that idea of you having to pay to be an adult 😛
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Day
And as an adult, I can think
🤔
I’m back from work once again, Ninnies
Good for you. Ok, NOW I can go to work
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I always get ready just a little too early and these last few minutes go by so slow
Meh
Always right before I have to leave for work, I run out of things to do
Well, I’m bored 😑
3K away from passing Kugal and getting into the top 5
ONLY 9 MORE LEVELS UNTIL PINK NUUUU
🎉
I’m back for about 15 minutes
Anyways, I must get ready for work. Brb
I'm good at reading
Well, the first time I read that comment, I thought Ida asked if you were a wench 😛
Lol
I'm referring to the wrench part
~~Draco is a tool confirmed?~~
No
😐
😏
Gummy, you know that you would get the shit beaten out of you because that's what happens
e!gummy
~~sleep for 12 hours?~~
I’m glad I invested in this tranquilizer gun 😛
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Master*
I have to go to my job this afternoon so I actually have something to do today
I could never do anything like that. I’m still trying to perfect my stick figure art <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Yeesh
Art stuff?
😐
Node hell?
Some people just don’t want to follow laws. Like those who don’t use their turn signals
There is another example of stupid driving here
I just thought of this
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FKXEOj6UkLw
Yeah.
Dumbass waited too long to turn. If my car didn’t have good brakes, I would’ve t-boned him. I think that’s the term
I almost got in a car wreck once. Someone pulled out in front of me when I was going 45mph. He was turning onto the road and I almost ran into him
Did you break any bones?
I don’t remember
Really?
And the world continues to be stupid. Does that work?
So Gummy is still being Gummy....
Ok, I’m going to bed a little earlier tonight
You asked for it
*throws Or Else at Gummy*
Do it or else
e!gummy-b
Ok, Master has been in VC alone for over an hour and a half by himself. That’s my job <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
There’s one part I just saw in the game where you fight Jared; the guy from Subway. Because the South Park police had him
It’s...something
Yes
I have no idea what’s going on. I’ve been busy watching gameplay of the new South Park game
I see the chat is back to the Flubs and Gummy Show. And one comment from me and Draco
WELL I’M NOT HER AM I?!
*throws rocks at Gummy* ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?!
Throw rocks at you
Uhh, Gummy stop poking her or I’ll...
I’ll threaten you in her place
*noms pokes*
DAMMIT, STOP KILLING MYSELF YOU NINNY SQUID
Pfft, that’s noth💀
Ok, that was a nice rest. What happened? All I remember was drinking all of Stuck’s alcohol and then nothing
😴
I’M NOOOT ALX, I’M SAINH YUR NAAAAME
I ALRDY DRNK IT AL
THIIIS IS NUTHNG
*drinks all the alcohol*
THIS WEBSITE LIES
😐
Regal there’s the stats

Meh, I’ll do that later
Shit, I remember I want to restart HeartGold
😏
~~You stole them?~~
Because you like candy?
😒
Yeah
My friends need to stop involving me in their stupid meme sharing shit...
I’m busy debating memes with friends
I leave for one minute 😑
Ok, now I’m fighting with my friends over what are good memes 😛
Quiet bot 😛
Again <:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
New people is not racist you ninny bot
We get too much enjoyment out of Skarm and his stupid sayings. And yeah, I remember
I know that feeling...
This isn’t a reward
Good, Skarm didn’t steal it
Random thought: You know, I kind of want a sandwich now
Oh hai Majestic
Can’t really say what it is; nsfw
One of my friends texted me and 2 other friends a stupid picture 😑
Anyone else not care about League like me or am I still the lonely Squid...
That video couldn’t keep me interested because I barely care about League 😒
I’m bored 😑
I DON’T DO LEAGUE <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I don’t know what any of that means
We’ll do it with WIZARD POWERS
Yet <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Then there’s me and Draco who are on here too much 😛
Night Ida
Cool is cool with me
That’s a meme...
No <@!162952008712716288> 😑
No, my real name is the same as a Pokémon. That’s your hint
Why does your name keep changing Dragonite 😛
Yeah
I doubt anyone remembers
I said my first name here once or twice
I never visited any forums
Dragonite is a grandpa now 😛
Just so you know, we call this place the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
Happy early birthday
I’m 19 too
Cool
FlubsFish
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
You unmuted? 😏
So no one would know me
I didn’t make my YouTube account until 2013
Level 1 for everyone!
Wiener 😏
It’s getting pretty active now
Oh hai Chewy
Lol
I had to watch YouTube in secret back then because I was 9 and my parents didn’t like me watching YouTube
I remember. I started watching YouTube with Marriland and Pokémon Diamond and eventually, I found Eyan
Yes
Diamond
I was a watcher of SuperSkarmory since late 2007. But I never was on any forums; too young
It’s ok. Not bad, but it could be better
This is the cereal
https://www.kelloggs.com/en_US/products/kellogg-s-cinnabon-cereal-product.html
Cinnamon role 🤔
The cereal is ok
Their cinnamon rolls are delicious
Ever hear of Cinnabon at least?
...any thoughts on this?
It’s hard to find; the only place I know that still sells it is my place of employment
I have had Cinnabon cereal
I love cinnamon rolls. But they’re not like that
Rolls
Cinnamon roles?
Warm them up and they’re delicious
They have small ones at Walmart. Two for $1.
That’s what I had
Cinnamon cake?
Triple ;
😒
*Gives Animal Man some if he asks nicely*
Ok, I’m back with cake
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😐
It has no effect on me
*noms super glue*
🔫 Tell me
😐
JA
🤔
I don’t remember stuff like this 😛
Maybe?
Why?
Really? Vortex = PewDiePie?
🍰
Honestly, I don’t care about ever going since I don’t have an interest in drinking
That’s pretty much the only reading ANYONE would go
If you want to get drunk and look at girls
I’ve never been to one; Hooters. The closest one to us closed years ago. When I was too young 😛
Pretty women and beer
Looks like yet another Hooters clone
It’s a sports bar
And yes, it’s exactly what you think
Yeeeeah
I’m watching Undercover Boss with a restaurant chain just called “Bikinis” 😐
*cricket chirping*
Well, it’s very active here
*noms cute*
😐
Lol
I was just copying Dan
How’d you know? 😛
Yeah
*sighs*
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
<:WutFace:327309186432237569>
BACONATOR
THE PLACE THAT HAS THE BURGER IN MY NAME
Burger King is the worst, compared to McDonald’s and Wendy’s
🤔
You’re right, I hate Big Macs...
At least I’m still SquidofBigMac
NEIN
I’m getting names wrong Animal Man
Lol
Isn’t that right Head Maid Flubs? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Getting names right
*wonders why I even bother*
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😐
Yeah, Kugal isn’t on much anymore
I know 5th is Kugal and I’m 6th. And I hope to pass him soon <:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
Whoever’s 4th
🤔
*Eyan ends up stopping the leveling up* 
Eyan: NO ONE ELSE MUST PASS ME
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
~~Am I pink yet?~~
I’m a wizard
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
What?
Gummy, do you even have $1?
Children 😨
Fake life? You mean YOU’RE NOT AN ACTUAL DRAGONITE?!!
Real life = Editing videos
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
It really makes you 🤔
What British Call biscuits, we call cookies. I think
I’ll take the house if you give it to me for $1
JA
*noms frozen crumpets*
I eat frozen dinners and ham sandwiches a lot
I haven’t had ramen in over 10 years
Ramen noodles?
Raman?
That’s random
DO YOU HAVE KRAFT?
SOMEONE MAKE DAN MAC AND CHEESE
Get this man some Kraft. Or Velveeta
😨
I want some Mac and cheese 😑
🎉
There you go Dan
Hola Flubberino
Did you forget your meds again? 😛
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Dan*
*SLEEP*
Hai Dan
I remember in Senior year in the higher video class, every day, I heard a lot of bad puns 😛
I actually enjoyed those for the most part
One exception off the top of my head was the video making classes
I don’t like school in general. Very few things actually interested me
Most History stuff just comes off as boring with a few interesting parts
JA
You need to think
🤔
I feel like I should be doing something for college but I don’t have anything due until Thursday
I do spend too much time here
Green
🎉
It’s a goofy emote 😛
Lol
I just wanted to use that emote
<:WalkthroughWizard:372149588783529994>
👍 for Animal Man
That’s for Draco
Meh
You need the TM at the end
<@!178655272796028928> It’s the Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>

And Flubs is 7 as usual
So cool, you need a K
Fine
Oh hai Animal Man
It is
I don’t really like people in general
I need to be better at liking people 😛
Lol
👌
Should we make a club?
It all thanks to me not having a social life 😛
🎉
I probably only saw you once
Oh
Usually Draco
Someone always does a greeting here
Greetings and salutations Burgz. Welcome to the Kingdom of Zeal
Yeah, I think after work then I’ll eat lunch and then just go back to sleep
Also, I have to go to work at 7:30am Saturday 😑
I can’t do that because I need to leave the house a little after 8 for college every morning
Yeah, I realized it the second after I sent that
I used to go from 10pm-8am a couple years ago
I haven’t been able to do that in a couple years
I can’t stay asleep for that long
😐
I even try naps if I can. Even if I get 8 hours, I still can feel tired
It’s something I’ll complain about and I’m too lazy to change it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Meh
Unhealthy diet, laziness, take your pick
I feel tired too much...
Don't fall down the stairs while vacuuming <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Don't fall down the stairs while doing laundry <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Have fun
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Anyways, shouldn't you be in class?
Soooo.... not necessary to mention you 😛
Actually, a YouTuber I watch talked about it today
e!gummy-b
That's not necessary
A really stupid comedy moment
Well, I'm making a video talking about how Michael Bay is producing a Dora The Explorer live action movie and the part I linked was the first 23 seconds of it
Anyways, did ya see my stupid video? 😛
I think it might have been because my phone was updating something in the photo part of it
It finally worked <#311402910820859914>
I restarted my phone and it’s still not working...
So, I can upload pictures from my computer but not my phone...
Or Discord
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
It won’t even load the picture
And I can’t post the video itself because the file size is too big
That’s odd. I can’t post any pictures
Just a second. I’ll show you
Well, I just made one of the dumbest things I’ve done so far...
🎉
Ok, back to class for a half hour more
Yeah, I’m pretty squeamish too. She had a couple realistic pictures of stuff in the respiratory system (Ex: vocal chords) on the PowerPoint she’s showing and I have a hard time looking at them
I haven’t dissected anything since 7th grade; worms, crawfish, and I can’t remember if we did frogs or not
I don’t think I’ll be eating any pork that day...
Pigs
We’ll be dissecting in lab this week 😐
Well, class is finally starting
*noms cheese*
*sees new pin*...I like cheese
I’m just waiting for class to start as usual
Morning
Shit, I forgot I need to do something. I need to leave now too
Oh right, he said that a while ago
Meh
Look, these are all problems I have seen happen in real life. That’s where I’m coming from
Someone might accidentally say or do something that offends or harms another
The craziness might get taken too far
Some people may find it annoying
At least the most active it’s been in a while
Yeah
Times are a changing
JA
No, everyone was crazy today
JA
I hope I don’t have anything due for Bio tomorrow morning
Hopefully
I don’t even notice that
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I can never use the regular FailFish again
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
~~blowing up the movie?~~
Meh
Is that a game or something a fan made?
Zelda?
WHAT IS THAT THING?! 
A BOMB! RIGHT!! GRAB IT!!
💣
🔥
I looked it up. It’s happening 😨
Where is this from?
*gets nothing* 😐
Source. Need. Source.
Source Gummy. I need a source
He directed the Transformers movies
Yeeeeeah...
Same here. Although, Some people who don’t understand it would probably disagree. They would see it as just more time looking at a screen
Because I doubt this counts...
I have college and a job, yet outside of that, I have just about no social life
I’m busy yet not busy at the same time
Ok, the craziest day that I’ve seen
Hello. Do you how do?
Grammar much?
Because I have no life
I’m here almost every day now 😑
Today was by far, the craziest day I have ever seen here
Twice as much. Holy shit...
Can you compare it to yesterday?
Wow
Messages
How many of that is from tonight?
😐
I feel tired again
I’m done with that.
I’m back because bored. It looks like it finally calmed down after I left
I censored myself
I’m getting out of here. See you f— ing Ninnies later
Ok, this is getting to be too much for me.
I wasn’t serious
😐
😐
Go take them Flubs
Flubs makes him dying by not remembering his meds hilarious
If you guys were in VC, then you wouldn’t have to worry about the slow down
The bot wants Animal Man to die 😑
😐
Skarm you are NOT innocent in all of this
*whispering*
*yeah*

Honestly
In real life, I’m one of the most calm people you’ll see
Who won?

Animal Man, can I have your skill in Overwatch?
Idk Dank
If you enjoy it, why do you say not to main Mercy?
Yeah
I main Reaper and Bastion
*High fives Dan*
I know Flubs...
I know nothing about League
Don’t main Mercy. Oh wait, this isn’t Overwatch
Dank 😐
JA
🤔
Oh hai Animal Man
Meh
I’m not staying here past 10:30. I can’t do that again
Meh
That’s why I’m around almost all day except for work and college <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Yeah
Just hang around a little more when you have time
*is meh*
WILL. GET IN HERE
Who deleted my thinking
I’m a weakling who needs sleep
I ended up waking up at 4
I dreamed about trying to wake up last night
Because, as Flubs says, SLEEP IS FUR DA WEEEAK
I know you can train yourself
How did you learn?
I really want to learn how to lucid dream 😏

Also, everyone needs to upvote the picture in <#311409240327585802> so it will be pinned <:Kappa:305551256104206336>

I didn’t say I was totally not insane
I said 1 step below
I’m one step below
I’m not on their level
😐
...well yeah
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
He’s never too happy to see Gummy 😏
Normally, he pops in at least once
I got into a match, only to see DEFEAT
Oh, before the stream Saturday, I blew it up 😛
I wonder if I’ll blow up the servers again 🤔
*proceeds to Overwatch*
Meh
What type of game is that?
Hmm, I don’t have much energy. Should I play Overwatch and get the blood pumping?
And I’m going to see if dinner is done
🎉
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
And Gummy DEFINITELY knows what Baka means
And some YouTube stuff
I nerd out over animation and video games
TIGGER
Oh hai Kugal

<:Comcast:338562329509756928> for Discord?
Wow...
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Let me try @ messaging you there. See if that does anything
😐
Oh hai Wolverale.
I just watch YouTube and play video games 😛
Stupid shit like this
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Oh hai RC
*sarcasm*
It’s fun for the whole family!
Well, it’s SquidofBaconator’s daily “I’m bored” time again
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
And make a drinking game out of it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Well, have fun. If you feel like it, you could make a clip show of it or something. Lol
He does say that a lot 😛
Why? Lol
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
It makes me constantly wonder if I should be working on something
Anyone else feel like that sometimes?
Ok, it feels like I have to do homework or something, but I don’t need to do anything right now. I hate this feeling; it makes it hard to relax
There's still room in his heart for you
I'm not a watcher
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Don't worry; when he's done, he'll rush straight to you 😏
FlubsFish is Best Fish
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
😒
Dead=Lol
💀
Only to non-bakas
Someone just called me an idiot in this game right as you said that 😛
😀
Yeah
LOL
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Picture change!
lol
"What's a queef?" "Emile, no. NO. NOOOO"
NOOOOOOOOO
"Did Chugga just admit that it would be awesome if Daisy was legal?"
I love it!
"Should we do Daisy on hard?"
Let's Players?
Lol, I just encountered a glitch in Light Platinum. There was a guy who is supposed to be blocking the gym at the time, but I just walked right through him 😛
Oh
Also, who isTB?
Honestly, I just don't feel like it 😛
In 7 months 😛
I already have 3 series; 2 reviewing and this Let's Playing. I also have a 2nd channel which I haven't uploaded to much
Meh <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
If we ever go there, I want to try the Buffalo Chicken one. That sounds great 😋
All Mac and Cheese
Right after I finish doing video stuff; almost done uploading
Let me see if I can find their menu
There's a small chain of like 8 restaurants around here and they have around 19 different types of Mac and Cheese
I haven't eaten at Panara. We have them; I just haven't gone there
Or Fatburger. Or Jack In A Box. Or Chick Fil A. Or Bojangles. WE HAVE ALMOST NOTHING AROUND HERE
Like how Waffle House is primarily in the South and In n Out in California
I wonder what places we have in the East/Northeast that the rest of the country doesn't get
They give you so many; even for the little size. I can't say anything about many other places, since I haven't traveled much; In n Out for example
Yeah
A half hour away from us; East and West. It's my favorite, but I don't go there that often
I'd rather go to Wendy's
I prefer their breakfast. The rest of their menu, meh
Seriously, I got them today and they are pretty good. I would just like them to be a little crispier
BUY MCDONALDS NEW CHICKEN TENDERS. THEY ARE GOOD
This has been "Squid's Thoughts" on ZealTV. Tune in next time for the next installment of Squid getting angry at Overwatch <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I think one problem that I end up having from my unhealthy lifestyle is that I'm tired a lot. Usually, a couple hours mid day is when that feeling goes away, but a good chunk of the day, I feel tired
And I just ate a snack, which brought up that thought
The thing is, I had Mcdonald's around 2 1/2 hours ago and fast food usually keeps me good until my next meal
Oh
If I don't, I usually get so hungry I feel nauseous. I hate that
Kind of, if eating snacks between most meals is that
Graze?
Random thought: I get hungry and eat too often
Lol
Pffft
Kevin
~~Make Master change his profile picture to that~~
Both
This is totally not a waste of time 😛
Great
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I just found that
LOL
<:FlubsFish:371860042430808065>
Yeah
I use both of them; depends on which computer I'm on. There are things that I like about both of them
And people say Internet Explorer is shit <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
We still have Internet Explorer on one of our two computers and that works better for using YouTube; mainly because it didn't update to YouTube's new look in it 😛
It takes longer for everything to load and they add steps to get to places that used to be easy to get to.
Sigh, ever since YouTube updated their look, it got slower to do anything 😑
Not only are the reviews longer, but they can be more tedious too
My last animation review took several hours to do
It depends on how much you want to put into them. If you're someone like Chugga, then they'll take longer
True. With my regular reviews, a lot more editing of clips and stuff needs to be done. And it takes longer for me to record audio, too
That was probably the fastest time I have edited a video. Usually, it takes me a couple hours.
It's going by quicker than I expected
I'm still the best at screwing up what I want to say 👍
Ok, time to edit the video that I didn't get to yesterday because laziness and my job 😛
Just play this to anyone who sounds like they are whining <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdsL4kvp_I
Today ain’t Opposite Day
True
I probably should’ve studied instead of messing around in VC last night 😛
I’m pretty sure I mixed up a couple things and I didn’t do the last question because I completely forgot how to do it
Well, I’m pretty sure I f—ked up half of that quiz today...
...what?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Do they get good business in the day?
Oh, you work night shifts. That explains it
How do you stay open?
I do nothing when I close and it’s dead
🤔🤔
Totally studying for my quiz this morning and not just watching YouTube
That and my phone battery is low 😛
I’m off to bed. Must get sleep for quiz tomorrow
See ya Flubs

Gummy’s here
ITS ALWAYS TIME TO CELEBRATE

Is that the solution?
So, ~~more e!gummy commands?~~
😐
AAAND Flubs keeps leaving me all alone in VC <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Oh hai Cadance
No
Well, what IS insane?
Saw that
Meh
🍔
enasni ydaerla m’I
🙃 I’m already insane
Does that show the nuke? 😛
😐
Wait, where did you get the nuke...
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
🍾
Well, this is fun; talking to Flubs
And me constantly telling him to go outside probably moved me up his hate list
Of course
I see Gummy dislikes me. Probably all the e!gummy commands. Flubs, if you want to
~~Join VC with the lonely Squid~~
Well, that’s over with. Now what?
*throws it away*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Thinking isn’t as fun when Flubs doesn’t get angry at it 😐
🤔
BULLSKITTY! BULLSKITTY! BULLSKITTY!
🙄
😐
Lol
We only have 1 refrigerator here?
Ok, random thought: First time I read Jello’s new title, I read it as Head Butter Jello 😛
e!gummy
Stuff the Moon with explosives? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Nice pin
Damn...
😐
The only other person who’s been here with me is just Flubs doing earrape
I’m getting tired of everyone being in it after I leave 😑
Unless anyone actually wants to join?
Yep
I’m in bed
I’m just saying what he would say in this situation
“SLEEP IS FUR DA WEEEAK”
Watch his latest episode of Joking Hazard. Hilarious <@335818633030795264>
I blame Flubs. He has a bad influence
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
So I threw a football at him
And I told him that’s his job
Go play
*throws a 🏈 at Gummy*
That’s your job Gummy
Now that’s over and I’m bored again 😑
*squirts HCL* There
🔫
*forces Gummy to write the story*
There’s your plot. Start writing
Perfect
🎉
Orange is better than red
I’ll take your silence as a yes <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
So is my story good? 😛
There
Once upon a time, Gummy met Flubs and they fell in love. The end
I hope I spelled that right 😛
Those are placebos
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Plot as in 😏 or story plot?
Then 😑
Anyways, how has everyone’s day been?
Do you need to ask. It’s always intentional <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>

Why do I keep dying here...
💀
*noms it all* Oh please, that does not-
Yes
Meh
Seriously, what are you talking about? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*noms phone and anywhere else that has it*

*sees new pin* Flubs, why do you want Nightshade with a telephone pole?
Well, I’m back from work ya Ninnies
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Oh, being poor and cheap...
And I know my parents would NOT want to pay
I will probably never go to any conventions because money
Good, you're doing something productive
I doubt Flubs sees it that way 😛
How about Flubs? 😏
That's more than I'll ever do 😛
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
🤔
I don't like horror so I'm not gonna watch it
Oh hai Will. How is TwitchCon?
Lol
It’s going to be a while until I get to Level 41
I’m just joking 😛
Lol
That’s something that someone who wants to get ahead would say <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*starts running*
Lol
Meh. I might just end up not doing it because laziness <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Alright. I think I want to finish editing my next video before work tonight
Meh
Something League?
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Pffft
🤔
~~Head Butter Jello~~
Well, Jello IS a food 😛
Oh, I read it as Head Butter <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Lol
Oh, I see you’re the Head Maid now.
As long as you get enough sleep, I guess 😛
Because nothing else was going on because stream 😛
Come to the stream Flubs
I wanted to go to Twitch, why did I login to YouTube 😑
*RUN TO TWITCH*

Hang on a second. I remember funny Minecraft video
Ida is with me
I don’t think I put 1000 hours into anything. Maybe a Pokémon game
😐
I don’t get how it got so freaking popular
Closest was Minecraft and I found it boring
I still haven’t touched Terraria
I stopped playing GTA Online because I didn’t want to sink money into it
I play golf
I played Online for a bit
GTA 5 is great
I’m really close to leveling up <:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
The closest I’ve played to XCom is the Mario and Rabbids game <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Ja Animal Man
Thinky good
I haven’t played Skyrim in months
What IS the worst idea?
So long. Hope you like Europe
Not Overwatch; I blew it up <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Now, what should I play now? Preferably something that doesn’t make me want to blow it up due to Ninnies like Overwatch
💀
Yeah
Oh hai Eyan
Meh
🤔
😋
😏
You’ll thank me later
SCREW THIS *Blows up the rest of Overwatch* PLAY SOMETHING ELSE
EVEN IN QUICK PLAY MY TEAM IS AWFUL
AND I NEVER WIN BECAUSE THE OVERWATCH GODS HATE ME
I just blew up Competitive
You can still do Quick Play
*grabs Stuck’s explosives and blows up Competitive in Overwatch*
NOW I’M SILVER AND I WILL NEVER GET HIGHER THAN THAT
I CANT DO COMPETITIVE ANYMORE
THIS IS AWFUL
AAAND SOMEONE LEFT EARLY. GOOD, WE DIDN’T NEED YOU
AND WHY IS THERE STILL 2 SNIPERS?!
WHY DID I GO INTO COMPETITIVE?!!
2 snipers. F—k me
Now I’m in
Ok, I’m stuck in Skirmish 😑
I’m playing Competitive. God help me...
🤔
Now, do I want to torture myself by playing Overwatch?
Ok, I’m done with watching YouTube for now
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
THERE! THAT’S BETTER!
*plays music loudly*
Well, that made the chat quiet...
Meh

Ok, I’m watching a food show and they’re showing off a hot dog with Mac n cheese
*shrug*
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
There’s nothing wrong with being pink. There IS something wrong with Gummy <:Kappa:305551256104206336>

Oh hai Animal Man
Meh

Flubs: STOP THINK
🤔
Lol. Ok, I’m heading out for a little while
~~Head Maid Draco~~
Around 800 exp left
When I go to 40, there will be a lot more orange, seeing how active we are
Anyways, I did very well on everything except probably the final and that paper. I would’ve at least gotten a B- if I did the paper
It also depends on the class; some go by points to tell if you got an A or lower
Below 60 is an F
D is in the 60s
In the 70s here
Speaking of not finishing homework, I ended up not doing a paper for Economics in the spring, since I procrastinated it to the point where I wouldn’t be able to finish it. I still got a C in the class 👍
~~Everyone?~~
That sounds like the most boring part
When they’re due, do you watch them all
Sounds kind of boring
With this?
🔫
🤔
Or more than enough
Hopefully, that doesn’t happen. One Gummy is enough
Unless someone new comes and is an even bigger spammer than Gummy
Now it looks like I’m talking to myself again 😛
*Quiet you*
At least Skarm can’t steal cake
*noms cake*
Piece of cake
This’ll be easy.
Hopefully, I level up by the end of the day
Nothing will top that, but still
What a way to Level up
🍾

Golf
Because you should go outside. Play ⛳
You aren’t in that position
😐
Earrape- Fun For The Whole Family
Weeeeeell?
Flubs why are you so obsessed with earrape
😑
Also, you spelled “Descent” wrong in the video title, Flubs
🤔
I believe so
Shit, I also need to study for a quiz
Or I could continue to do nothing all day
Speaking of YouTube, I really should edit the 3rd part to my Let’s Play that no one will watch 😑
🎉
Plus loud music with poor placement all over the video
Yes
That was...something
That and the cutting of each of the clips
God, the editing is just, 😑
I didn’t know Flubs had a YouTube account
Well, where is it?
*Looks at Flubs* Can I see the video?
His real voice?
No negative reaction to 🤔 Who are you and what have you done with Flubs?!
🤔
😑
😐
Get to it
You heard him Gummy
😏
*noms pokes*
Speaking of Flubs...
And to ignore Flubs saying ”SLEEP IS FUR DA WEEEAK”
This is why I always tell you to get sleep
*sees pin* Gee Gummy, I don’t know. Why do you think you did that...
I haven’t been able to get out of a meh mood recently
I haven’t had much of a drive to even do things I like
Random thought: These past couple of days, whenever I get free time, I want to do something but all I end up doing is watch YouTube and lurk here. I’ve barely played any video games too. On a scale of 1 to 10, how lazy and boring has my life gotten?
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
How accurate is this?
“Today, I got stuck in another box after falling down the stairs. Again. Will I be able to get out and take my meds? And most importantly, will I be able to stop the think?”
A Day In The Life Of Flubs ™
Flubs: <:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
Everything?
e!gummy
From the last night
It seems like every morning I look at the chat, it’s usually Flubs and Gummy doing whatever
Whatever. I’m going to sleep now
If nomming could solve our problems...
😑
*noms the way of things* Does that help?
That and I hate feeling tired
Sometimes, I wish we didn’t need to sleep. We’d have so much more time to do things instead of spending a good chunk of your life in bed
It keeps me entertained
😛
PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
*sarcasm*
PICK ME!!! <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
What?
...
Hope everyone likes the “Squid’s Random Thoughts” show
Then I’ll be so hungry, I feel sick in the morning
I also wish I didn’t get hungry right before bed.
*Sigh*
Then I would be doing something else with my time
I really wish I didn’t get so bored easily almost every night
I feel like this could easily annoy someone
Are you guys entertained or annoyed by this?
Ok, I’m getting less entertained from this
THOUGHTS. STOP TORTURING ME. *I’ll never leave you. We’ll be together. FOREVER* FUUUUUU
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. YOU’RE A PART OF ME
*So you DO like me!* I WAS BEING SARCASTIC
Totally <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*Want to talk with me?* LEAVE ME ALONE THOUGHTS
Nah...
Soooo... ~~Have Flubs kill my hearing?~~
And I don’t feel like playing any more video games
I just finished watching the last YouTube videos I wanted to watch tonight
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Meh, I don’t know what to do right now. And I don’t want to sleep yet
Like just now
💀
I die here at least a couple times a day
Meh
Also, Las Vegas is in Nevada, Master
🤔
Why the iron, Dragonite?
My copy of Emerald, the battery dried out so clock based events don’t work anymore
MINE IS IN REACH

*noms politics*
If only prices for housing was that low...
I also don’t travel much
Montreal
Ontario, Vancouver, North Canada
I was technically in CanadaLand too for Niagra Falls when I was really young
New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Utah. If you count states I was at airports in, Minnesota and Georgia
I’ve never been to California. Closest I’ve been is Utah
Where’s Long Beach? California?
🎉
Quick update, but still
Greeeat, it needs an update <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I won 3 times in Comp. After the placement matches
Quick Play. Comp is awful
Ok, I feel like torturing myself. I think I’ll play Overwatch
HOLY SHIT
I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
*shrug*
Maybe it’s because we’ve been here more often which means there’s more opportunities for our messages to be pinned
🎉
That’ll be $5 from each of you
This has been SquidofBaconator’s random thought of the night
Also, on a random note, 5 of the pinned messages are mine. That’s the highest it’s ever been
Over half of your messages have lol
Lol XD ^w^
🍪🎉
HE ADMITS IT
And Skarm hasn’t stolen them
Meh
*at a :🍪:*
*points*
*looks at everyone*
But then, we went silent
You’re probably going to win
🎉
I’m referring to the complaining to the network type of parents
That type of overprotective parenting really annoys me
Yeah, at least they don’t act like them
I can kind of understand that. Kids do copy a lot of what they see on tv. At least they aren’t the type of idiots who complain to the networks
Oh
I’m guessing your parents hated animation
They just find them inappropriate or they just not like them or animation in general?
Of course...
I know my mom didn’t like me watching Ed Edd n Eddy but I still watched it and it’s still my favorite animated show
Why weren’t you allowed to watch these shows?
What HAVE you watched?
Shows I wasn’t allowed to watch were more along the lines of Courage The Cowardly Dog
Wow
Really?
😐
Yes
Have you seen the video with him and Chuggaaconroy?
His most popular ones seem to be in his Every Episode of SpongeBob Reviewed series
You watch him too?
This video helps explain that: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AiGMXlyEtaA
Sounds like the Don’t Like, Don’t Watch argument and personally, I’m not a fan of it
This is Ash Ketchum, he’s looking for the One Piece with the help of Vegeta
That seems like it belongs in the meme channel 😛
😐
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>

Ok, I just found out that the board game, Clue, has a movie
Hey, we both can be terrible singers <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
~~SquidofMusic~~
Which means I’m all set to start a singing career.
It doesn’t matter what type of beat, you just need one
If you have a beat in your song, it’s golden
Most people don’t really care about anything in songs. The only thing that matters is a beat
Then again, most popular singers can’t sing anyways so we ALL have a shot at making it big
Also, I do agree with you on VC. Most times, it’s just one person talking and everyone else is muted. Or no one knows what to say.
Dammit thoughts. *What did I do?* EVERYTHING
*You ACT like it?* Shh, they can’t know
I sometimes act like I’m talking to myself when no one else is around or when I’m in VC alone
“Squid and His Thoughts”

And “How to Constantly Commit Treason With Gummy”
We all provide random shit to it 😛
We should make ZealTV a thing 😛
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
The answer is one; if I eat two, they will both come back up
If you have one Baconator plus one Baconator, how many Baconators will I eat?
And math=smarter=Less Brain Cells lost
Because math
That I felt like saying
That’s just something I see here
<:Kappa:305551256104206336> =not serious
I see <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I know
Like this?
You mean
I’M NOT GUMMY
See? Lol
I can’t pass Draco if he’s always here when I am 😛
😏
I thought I made it clear that I don’t care enough to look League up and put that effort into it
I DON’T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT LEAGUE TO LOOK THIS UP

This sums me up right now
Mundo?
Yes
Meh
Oof
What?
I haven’t read it since July, I think
I just saw that
😐
*THE MORE YOU KNOW*
Oh, that’s what that is. I didn’t know we had a sub only channel 😛
<:ThinkingKing:325447327940870145>
What do you mean by that?
I know Flubs joined about a month after me and he passed all of us fast
And then I was on here more often and now I’m 7th
I don’t remember. All I know is, you passed me at some point
Hey, I got up here fast too. By not having much of a life 😛
I typed that a little too late
Lol
😛
Now, in order to get to level 40 first, I need to be on here all night and Draco needs to stop talking until I pass him <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Quiet you
So, why did Skarm get made to do that anyways?
Skarm stole your cookie, Dragonite
😡
Sandwich? Cookie?
Hai Will
Again
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
Boo
One guy last year came to work as the Fonz
This isn’t elementary school
I’m shy, so I wouldn’t want to go to work or school in a costume anyways 😐
AWWWW
DO IT
I hope I'm not the only one who doesn't dress up
I don't have a costume and I don't feel like buying one
PFFFFFFFT
I honestly don't feel like dressing up, so I'll just put on a nametag that says Jake and I can be Jake From State Farm. Have you seen that commercial? I'd say "I work here now, because I got fired from State Farm"
Speaking of Halloween, we are allowed to dress up at work then.
Maybe because there are either no laws in place or no one had to worry about it before.
Why have I never heard of this before? 🤔
It differs for each town; one starts as early as 5:30 and a different town ends at 7
6-8
Looking up my area, all I can find is just times for it
I've never heard of anything like that in my area.
From what I've seen, it looks like a local law thing
All I've heard of is time limits for when you can do it
Because I've never heard of this
Is this local or state laws?
Really?
Like how you're never too old to go trick or treating. And that doesn't sound too fun; I'd just eat the marshmellows
You're never too old to throw snowballs at people
*sends Gummy to a random farm* OK, you guys can throw snowballs at him now!
I've never heard of it being illegal
😨
Put some warm clothing on and have a snowball fight
Wear a coat
Go play outside until he's available
Good being a baka...
e!gummy
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Don't say it's not possible with high school, we have a lot of high schoolers employed where I work and I'm dealing with college and my job
Still, get a job
Get a job
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
The one from the MLP movie, I'm guessing?
*Plays Slipknot in Sutck's ears*
*Is currently listening to music myself*
For once, something that isn't  <:Treason:305563730056314880>
Now, back to my homework
This was SquidofBaconator's math lesson of the day
And then <:Treason:305563730056314880> =Gummy
Lies=<:Treason:305563730056314880>
😒
Buffalo chicken, fries, garlic bread
I go into dinner not feeling hungry and then I end up eating like a pig 😑
Me too
*THE MORE YOU KNOW*
Welcome to the “I can’t hit anything” Club
Good job
And now, dinner time 😋
Those are broken
I’m just a Baconator/Squid.
Gummy= <:Treason:305563730056314880>
Why is everything Gummy does ends up being treason?
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
e!gummy
😐
🎉
Well, that just killed the chat
😏
*throws ashes at Gummy* There you go
I guess a Flubs can’t breathe underwater
💀
RIP
*Stuck In A Box Of Water*
🎉
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
What is it?
What is this? Someone else nom on it and tell me what it is
😐
*shoots water at Flubs* Wait, is this water?
Leave
🔫
Now go out the 🚪
I wasn’t referring to you
🚪
Try to dab on that 😒
*noms Jake and Logan Paul’s YouTube accounts*
NO TALK OF JAKE PAUL HERE
Hi is important
<@199725993416589313> Hi
🤔
Meh
e!gummy
Grammar? Hello. Do you how do?
Idk. And Master, that’s because he keeps saying something almost every time I do, so it’s hard for me to gain on him 😛
I just remembered I need to do my Psychology work, which will probably take 2 hours to finish. *I CaN WaIT a LIttlE LOngEr*
*noms air*
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
🤔
Just full of air?
So, not edgy at all?
😐
Lay
You ruined the Kay train
Kay <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
At least Gummy is outside
18 today would’ve killed me <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
A couple thousand yards
1 1/2 to 2 hours long
I played 9 holes of golf today
And I didn’t stay up all night
No, I’ve just done a lot today
I feel...so to tired. I can’t tell you how long I’ve been asleep or trying to sleep
Tell her to go outside then
And how is this a bad thing?
Hope I nommed food this time
*noms something*
I sometimes feel like that
😐
Lol
Well?
*Stares at Dragonite*
Meh
Should that be my reaction?
😱
I see
Oh hai Ninnies
Excuses...
I really need to get a life...
I’m leaving too. I wasted enough time here today
*noms bad grammar*
😐
*slow clap*
Tust?

Ok, I left VC, it’s safe for you guys to go in now. I won’t torture you <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
~~SLEEP~~
Just like Overwatch!
Yep
💀
And 💣
Laced with BACON
No
There, that solved all our problems
Well, seeing as how no one needs this...*noms VC*
:not amused:
RC, why do you keep doing that?
I really might go to bed soon because I really am tired of sitting here
Lol
Ok, I’m going away now...*sees 5 people in VC right after I leave* FUUUUU
Now I’m thinking no one has joined just for this <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*noms Brain* Therr, taht sloves evrythn- 💀
*Squid, you got me* SHUT UP
Well, I’m still talking to myself in VC, so I’m bored 😛
Brb
Yeah, thanks Flubs
😐
Meh
Meanwhile in VC: *So Squid, why are you still here* I don’t know, now shut up thoughts
🖐
😐
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Only 2 hours late
Dammit Flubs...
Let the puppy sleep
™
Only in the Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
But I am going mad 🙃
And my throat is fine
I have food in my stomach
I’m just talking to my thoughts in VC 😛
Oh hai Will
Hey, I didn’t start them
Seems like Gummy has something against me. Probably all the e!gummy commands
Squid: You bore me
Squid: No
Now it’s just me and my thoughts again
There
Why don’t YOU join? Flubs misses you
Yep
Well, something did happen
🎉
I just want something to help me stay awake
That’s fine, I’m just tired
😴
😒😒
This is boring when I’m the only one talking
Gummy, why don’t you join? 😏
Saw that
e!gummy-b
I’m talking. To myself 😏
😐
😐
🚪
Called Joking Hazard
They made a good card game
Cyanide. And happiness <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
But not these cho- 💀
Yep
*noms chocolates*
🤔
My life is boring
Like every other night
Well, I’m bored
Doggo!
💩
Ah, Flubs earrape. Always greeting me
Lol
😒
Better than Mario Kart?
😐
Sigh
Full of wannabe MLG people?
So why play it?
I would use it for “I’m sad about something”
Oh
=w=;
What does that mean?
I know <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
You don’t like my memes? WELL EXCUSE ME FOR LIVING
<#311402910820859914>
🎼
YOU’LL NEVER SEE IT COMING
😐
Pffft?
I’ll just stay here and think
Whatever floats your boat
👍
🤔🤔🤔
No, I like 🤔
Meh
I think I’m losing brain cells at a faster pace than before
I like pie
No IT’s WOrkiNG FinE
WHICH MEANS, MORE RANDOM THOUGHTS
MORE SAYING THINGS=MORE POINTS=LEVEL 40 FASTER
I KEEP SAYING THINGS
I ran out of things to say. Skarm?
😐
Good, he’s quiet
Right Skarm?
I would still tell him
Maybe
No
Quiet you
Except then
But he always steals my cookies

You want to go outside too? You and Gummy can go play tag
Then you can go outside more
Language Flubs...
Great explanation Flubs...
EXCEPT THAT ITS A GAME
I STILL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT LEAGUE
What?
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
🤔
💀
🙄
😏
New nerves
Prosthetics
Wheelchair
*takes his cane* I’ll give it back when you mature a little
Hai RC
*Watches Flubs age*
That’s not excusing you to always be immature
I say, no matter how old you get, you will always have a little bit of immaturity in you
Meh
😑
There was one book we had to read in 12th grade; Michael J Fox’s autobiography. NO ONE liked it. Even our teacher said it wasn’t that good but we had to do it because the school bought it
I got nothing. I hate reading
~~Sparknotes?~~
Good, now go outside
REDDIT IS OVERRATED
Or those who only like NORMIE memes 😑
I like some memes; I was just using Master’s previous comment
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
My life is worse than memes and it can’t be taken when I’m dead
🤔
Life
I’ll take that as a yes 😛
What are you referring to? My life? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*walks away confused*
I can’t tell if that’s a joke or semi-serious
😐
Idk
Maybe
I nommed noms something
*noms noms something*
Draco: Pffft
Flubs: I HATE THINK
Me: Something
Idk
Flubs: <:Downvote:316033532684140544> NO THINK
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
*noms whatever that is*
Why u mad bro?
😐

I just saw that
Oh, your name is no longer Dragonoob 😑
*noms ALL THE CHICKENS*
*continues nomming fried chicken*
🐔 👍
Which is why I nommed it
*noms old fried chicken*
Actually, it seems like I’m the only one here. *I’m here* WELL, I WISH YOU WEREN’T HERE, MY THOUGHTS
...
The silence means you confirm it
~~Flubs is a ghost confirmed~~
But...that means your dead
So, what is the worst thing that comes from 🤔
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*noms chicken*
😐
🤔
Here’s a joke: my life
Well, I’m starting to get bored. Anyone have a good joke?
🎉
Weeeeell?
Enough to no longer live in a house, so you have to be stuck in a box?
🤔
I don’t want to know how much Gummy and Flubs will get taxed...
We tax stupidity?
🎻
Some kids do have a problem
Yeah
“BUt I gOt tO TExT MY FriENDs”
Kids really can’t stop going on their phones for 5 minutes
Overwatch Comp is of the devil
Oh hai Dan
Yeah
At least they’re small and right by each other
Well, good news: my wisdom teeth are fine. Bad news: I need to have 2 small cavities filled at the beginning of 2018
Me, it’ll probably be another day or two
🎉
Ok, since I’m not at the college anymore, I’m going to do something else so I don’t Run the data up on this. Maybe I’ll be back. Maybe not. Idk
Pffft
Meh
Now since that’s over with, I now have to wait for my dentist appointment. Here’s to another hour of waiting
Ok, it’s finally time for Bio lab
When the last one was coming through, I did it almost every other bite
It did
But I occasionally bite my inside gum when eating. It happened mostly when it was still coming through but it only happens occasionally now
I believe they’re all done coming through
I’ll also probably see if I can keep my wisdom teeth or not
I had to get 3 cavities filled last time I got X-rays
Anyways, I also have to get X-rays done at the dentist today and I hope the dentist doesn’t find anything wrong with my teeth
💀
🌙
10 more minutes
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Also, I love that term “Ninniot” 😛
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Then again, Eyan was the first to coin it here, so... 
~~Eyan is the Big veteran ninny confirmed?~~
~~Does that make me a veteran ninny?~~ <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I started in August
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
I WIN
And 7 pages of me saying Ninny
Well, there’s 6 pages of you saying that
Ninny Something
Also...
Something Something
Can you even search this stuff?
It’s only a little cool
I have water but it’s not cold
I’m still having trouble staying awake. I could walk around but I don’t feel like it 😛
25 more minutes until I go to Bio lab
Good for you
👍
And with my past high school, it was either not on or unable to understand
I’m just saying it’s keeping me awake which is a good thing for once
I’ve heard louder
Also, her microphone is loud enough to keep me awake
Less people playing Bingo than last time
I don’t like to work
Meh
The couches here are nice. Just a little hard for me
I got to stop getting comfortable
But I can’t because class. And dentist
I feel like falling asleep 😑
Except when I have to go to Bio lab and the dentist later.
Maybe I always have something to say 😛
I don’t get the joke
They do that quite a bit
😒
Hmm... Bingo is in an hour
Seriously though, I do eat a lot here
👍
😛
PFFFFFFT
Oh wait, Flubs isn’t around.
FLUBS: STOP THINK
🤔🤔🤔
Ok, why the hell am I watching food videos when I’m hungry 😑
I think it was a mix of work and recording yesterday
I can’t remember what but I was not here for a little while
Yeah
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Then I’ll eat like a pig 😛
Aaaand I’m hungry but lunch doesn’t start for 23 more minutes 😑
And now, the long wait for lab begins
And class is resuming now
Meh. It just doesn’t interest me at all
The heart, blood, and stuff in that area. I’m only taking this class because I need lab science credits
Biology
This class is boring me 😑
e!gummy-b
Just trying to find videos to watch to waste time
Oh hai Will
Well, I’m starting to get bored
🎉
Sounds like Flubs is having fun
👍
I’m done yelling now
Good. Sleep
I’m still not going to play it
🤔
I like croutons. And fudge
I’ve heard trotting more
I’ve heard it in use

*Noms lol*
Well, fine
Want to see how I look in a suit?
People can’t even do that? 😒
Is that it?
We had senior pictures which we got all dressed up for our yearbook pictures
What do you mean by grad photos?
But how would they fly?
Oh hai
🤡
Lol
🤔 isn’t
😐
REMEMBER
Good; you remembered
Did you take your meds?
Maybe you should see a doctor?
That ain’t good
How are the citizens of the Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™ doing?
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Hi Ninnies. I’m back from work
🎉
You don’t want to know what I had to do to get them...
*Hands Dragonite explosives* Don’t ask where I got them, just have fun
It seems like the usual shenanigans happened last night 😒
Time for some memes
I just don’t feel like sleeping yet
I don’t really care
Meh
That’s a load of help <:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
*You should sleep* Shut up thoughts. You’re not helping right now
I have my Switch but I’m not sure if I want to play video games right now
Now what?
Well, that’s it for watching YouTube tonight.
😛
And then there’s that
Ah, thinking. How you give such strong reactions out of all of us.
🤔
PFFFFFFT
The WiFi doesn’t like being used
-_-
Hi Ninnies. I’m back from work
See you ninnies later
But for now, I need to get ready for work
Mario and Rabbids, M&L: Dream Team, Pokemon Rumble Blast, and all the Pokemon Hacks and fan games I have
I have quite a few games I need to finish
Did someone say door? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
🚪
Because I can’t e!ida
e!gummy

What happened Gummy?
Now I have 40 minutes before I have to get ready for work
Ah, I love 🥞 and 🥓
Yes
YOU MUST DIIIIIE
Because MEMES
MY BOY
<:King:356095432495202315>
Saw that 😛
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Pokemon Insurgence's site is back up!
I love these things
These
😑
Swiss roll
It's been in there for almost an hour; it probably went through my stomach
This was SquidofBaconator's random thought of the day
I just had a snack and I'm hungry again: I really do have the mentality of a fat person 😑
Slavinator grew to Level 4! Slavinator grew to Level 5! Slavinator learned Tail Whip! Slavinator grew to Level 6! Slavinator grew to Level 7!
Oh, I just thought of another great Chugga moment: his win at the Dewford Gym in Emerald
Excuses...
Study
Anyways, go to class Gummy 😛
🎉
Oh, and "I'M BACK FROM WORK YA NINNIES"
True
😐
That's yours
Pffft
Since the e!gummy commands don't count
Also, seeing the last messages in the bot channel made me realize: I don't think I have a catchphrase yet 😛
This is just what'll get me through waiting for this video to export and upload
👌
Lol
No
OH MY GOD! IT'S A PHAAANPY
Welp
👌
That just made me laugh really hard  right now 😂
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I believe so
I did see Superstar Saga. And that quote is from Pokemon Emerald; catching Groudon in a nest ball
Probably his funniest moment right there
😛
OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! WHAHJAHAHAHA?!! I lost man points. Heavily...
Chuggaaconroy is one of the few who can do that extremely well
A little of both.
There are portions of a lot of his videos that I tend to skip
Yeah. Personally, I like 20 minutes for lets plays. There is one guy I watch who tries to get episodes around an hour. I really like him, but that's too long for one sitting.
I ended up going from 21 minutes to just under 14. Thanks to cutting out random wild Pokemon encounters and speeding up trainer battles
Well, in that time, I managed to finish editing.
Yep
Even though I don't have them...
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
My internet was still working so I don't know what the hell happened
Yes; it wouldn't connect for at least 15 minutes
Ok, Discord is working for me now...
Well, that was ridiculous 😛
Now I know what you're talking about. I don't think I've heard it though
OOOOOHHH
Never heard of it
Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH1hkWeQBrc
Or country rap; that stuff is awful
My least favorite type of music has to be rap/hip hop
I'm not the biggest fan of instrumental only music. There is some I do like, but I prefer having someing singing
Meh
I could never do music; I can't sing worth shit with my voice 😛
I'm editing this video right now
Wait, did you say it? I was busy 😛
And it seems like that won't happen 😑
No, I was just saying that to counter Animal Man's eventual "NEIN" to my thinking
JA
🤔
It was in the 30's when I woke up. I had to scrape frost off my car before going to class
This week
And  I told him to go outside for the 1,000th time
JA
🤔
Fine. I'm trying to decide  if I want to edit my next video or just play more video games
Oh hai Animal Man
😐
Or go outside
...what?
Blue Pepe 😛
And now, class time
Yes. It was in the 30s when I woke up
Didn’t think I would be on time to class today. I had to take a couple minutes and scrape frost off my car and I also got stuck in traffic for a couple minutes
😐
See you ninnies later, but not tonight. I’m not in a good mood...
That’s it, I’m out of here. I’m getting nothing out of being here.
I have the bot turned all the way down too. Because I don’t like listening to that music. <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
We can’t even say anything
Nice pin
This is f—ing pointless
And how to go outside
Teach you how to not be a ninny
Yay!
🙄
👍
Coughing party
HI FLUBS
Go take your meds

STOP YELLING. THAT DOESN’T HELP
It’s quiet here in the general chat
No answer. I’m guessing he LOVES it
Flubs, how is the floor?
😑
He’s Stuck in a box, on his way to Gummy
*spoon*
Hope the floor enjoys your company
*noms cane*
I have 12,513 messages and counting

Flubs, do you try to kill yourself?
There’s fuel
⛽️
I’m always confused here
See?
All the treason...

<:Treason:305563730056314880>
If they did, you would stop falling down stairs while doing laundry
Flubs, your legs barely work anyways
Ok, let’s stop talking about ribs
😐
I can kind of feel mine
🤔
🚪
😐
😐
Except once every other week
I just don’t shave
Supersize vs Superskinny: a show that also tries to profit off getting people to gain weight
I like being lazy
Nah
Like, holy shit, I’m lazy
VERY lazy
I’m lazy
But I’m not going to use it unless I start getting fat
We have one
Since I don’t like going outside, I always walked around my house <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
There was an app that measures how far you walk
I ended up taking an online walking class 😛
At least here
Liberal Arts degree: you need wellness credits
👌
If you were there, that would make sense
I thought that shit stopped in high school
Are you in college?
Wow
😐
Punch a squirrel?
Oh hai Wolverale
Hooray for nothing
After doing nothing, I return
Do your work
Have fun
*runs around*
Brb. Cupcake time
*noms Reddit*
Reddit over us...
😐
Everything
Grammar good
You don’t have to; he just drives you to act more crazy
Meh
Spend enough time around Flubs and you’ll be crazy too
🎉
That’s because this is the Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™ 
How many times do I have to say it until everyone doesn’t question the craziness and stupidity here? 😛
I lead a not boring life <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Maybe because I haven’t done anything today except play Pokémon rom hacks, watch YouTube, and be stupid here
Random thought: my legs felt a little weak when I just stood up.
Ok, who else needs a title?
Eyan- King of The Ninnies
You do it on your own
That’s right Dan
Sure
🤔
*gives everyone a Baconator*
Gummy is the moron/ninny
Gummy already has that title Dan
🍪
Then I’ll be our resident Baconator person
So, Will is our resident cookie person?
HE’S not. We can still eat cookies
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
What?
🍪 or 🍰
How should we celebrate?
Thinking wins
You see? They can’t counter that.
🤔🤔🤔
*noms too much information*
Too much information
😐
This is why you need sleep
Flubs, ya messed it up
👌 pin
Sleep makes you think better; no wonder why Flubs hates it so much
SONIC JOKE
GOTTA GO FAST
😐
“Hendan lo”
Oh hai Dan
Get your head out of the gutter
No, you’re Tigger
But now I’ll eat it
Dammit Kugal, I was going to give you a cookie
😑
Make the joke
Meh
*SPOOK joke*
😐
I’ll eat this chicken down to the BONE
This chicken bone from my food
*pokes a bone*
*Leads the dogs to the bones*
Now you just got bones
~~Flubs is just a skeleton now~~
Your skin? And bones? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iGGz3Nl84
Good job
😐
Did I nom your cane or leg?
Ok, what did I nom now?
*noms something*
Meh

I think I did it wrong

The inner mechanics of my mind are an enigma

Quiet you
I remember every time Majestic said it, Skarm kept stealing them
I don’t really like that
What kind?
DAMMIT
A sandwich is better than Nightshade according to this ninny bot
And Skarm better not steal it
I don’t have anything else for sandwiches
Probably ham and cheese
I really do want a sandwich
🤔
You’re just eating air
I already ate it you ninny
*noms sandwich*
I’m hungry
*Insert SquidofBaconator nomming something*
*Insert Maid Draco saying Pffft.*
*Insert Flubs saying SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEK*
Good. Sleep
Just fine
Oh hai Ninny
Eh
Never seen that before
Never heard of it
...what?
I know some people do sell stuff like roasted grasshoppers or something
Did you want a bug for lunch? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I see Gummy is doing fine
Get well soon
I’m pretty sure it’s the only one that doesn’t put a virus or something on your computer but I ain’t checking that...
I need to remember to bookmark it
It’s the only one I actually trust
Thanks. I’ll try looking for it
I don’t trust a lot of these sites
It was just called “YouTubeinmp4”
There was one that I used to use that I can’t find
Anyone know of a good site that converts YouTube videos to mp3 or mp4? That actually works?
Life sucks sometimes
Well, time for class. And time to see how much I forgot (probably everything)
I think you either know exactly what you want to do or you are completely clueless
It’s really stressing me out
But I’m still getting pressured to figure out what to do and where to go after this. And I don’t have a clue
I’m glad this is my last semester for my Associates
I’m just tired of school
*sigh* I’m getting tired of coming to class
Good night ninnies
I’m just gonna go to bed now...
🤔
I gave you a cookie already!
My popcorn
Hey!
I don’t know
😑
Keep me out of this
*noms popcorn*
Quiet you
I’m glad Skarm hasn’t stolen my cookies yet
And eat a cookie
I’ll just stay out of this...
You got a cake
🍪
For that, you get a cookie
😒
🎻 or 😭
Who is right?
Sad? World’s smallest violin sad or sad sad?
We don’t need any more Gummy’s
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
👍🎉
I’m more curious as what a Flubs looks like
I wonder what you think a SquidofBaconator looks like?
JUST DO IT
Do it
I like Nekopara 😑
Aww...
“Boiled Asparagus”
*noms cards*
Like Nekopara or... I can’t remember any visual novels

“Oh hey, you also watch some guy playing a game with bad camera quality!”
😐
🤔
So, would I be the class pet or lunch? Or both?
Also, talking about that school idea, I couldn’t go because I’m a Squid/Baconator
e!gummy
Yeah, June is a good b-day time
So, it’s Everyday Bro? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
June 28th
I’m 19
That’s another person here that I’m older than
😐
You’re only 15?
What happened 9 months ago?
My sister will be 27 in 2 days
TIGGER
JA JA JA JA JA
🤔
Oh hai Chewy
I’m busy watching YouTube
Oh hai Will
I’m just referring to the work part of the day. Don’t get so specific
I’m talking about work
I thought that day would never end
Hai Animal Man
Oh hai Ninnies. I’m back from my job once again
Well, I’m halfway there
Especially since class starts back up tomorrow
I don’t want to work
😑
Now, I’m just waiting until I have to get ready for work
I don’t really know
I thought it was chocolate but I wasn’t sure if it tasted like it
It had some weird filling in it; I didn’t like that
Red velvet 👍
And now, time for a cupcake
Example
You have to hold down on the message you want to react to
I could go over to my computer and use Discord over there, but I want to sit on this couch
It’s kind of annoying
It’s not good
I use it most of the time; except when I'm at my computer
*Goes back to Pokemon*
😐
Good job
Meh
I don't know that big word
*noms poking*
Whenever I go to my job or college
Good, now that you got some sleep, you can use that energy to go outside
Hai
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I’m tired. I feel like doing something but I don’t want to get up

*Screw Normies*
Reddit is overrated
I have no idea what you guys are talking about
*noms something again* I’m bored
🤔
😒
AGAIN
It looks like Flubs is blowing stuff up.
What the hell is going on...
I don’t really like coconut; texture
Get a 🍰 then
You doing anything for your birthday?
Yeah
The rest of it was good
There is this brewery not far from us that had some type of beer cheese on one of their sandwiches and I didn’t like that part of it
Yes, like beer battered stuff
Probably both
I’m pretty sure when I turn 21, I will either dislike it or get drunk after 1
Lol
🍺
Although, I believe it’s actually tomorrow
We’re actually celebrating my sister’s birthday today too 😛
🎉
Even though I got enough sleep
Well, an hour after I woke up and I feel like going back to sleep 😐
Meh
So I shouldn’t still be in the 70’s 😛
78 to 52 and then 70’s for the rest of the week
It’s getting really warm again today, only to get cooler again
Ok, I’m going to bed. Later Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
...
Do you have Comcast?
Meh
😒
And actually say something
Stop screaming
Most people are probably busy doing other things or are out actually having a life 😛
It’s been like that for a while
Meh
I guess that’s your thing; showing people to the door
I see RC has his doors still
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
“Emile came over for a meal”
I watch Chuggaaconroy; I love most bad puns
Lol
See yourself out
Here’s the 🚪
😒
Damn, now I want pie
I prefer apple, chocolate-peanut butter, pumpkin, and lemon meringue
3.14159265.....
😐
All I said was bad cheese
Bad cheese?
That’s jus- 💀
Shit, where did my computer go?
*noms something* I hate getting hungry at this time of night
I’m the only person who this can happen to
I adjust how I’m sitting, the headphones cord got in the way, and I dropped my phone
Yes
I just dropped my phone on my chin 😐
🤔
That’s not what I had in mind
*noms screams*
Well, it got pretty quiet round here
Except when I'm trying to catch a legendary 😛
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
But I still lost a battle. Without someone to heal your Pokemon, there is no chance you'll win all 3 battles
However, this time I remembered to get Elekid before leaving
And now, I'm reminded of how difficult the beginning of the game is 😛
Meh, I’ll keep 2 poisons.
It’s my least favorite grass starter
And I’m not a fan of Meganium
Maybe. I thought of Venasaur and Feraligator, but that would mean I have 2 poison types
There’s 2 spots left for whatever I want
I’m trying to think of my team: I know I want Toxicroak and possibly Electabuzz
Yeah. First time I played, I chose Charmander and getting Growlithe early on really annoyed me
You can also get a Johto starter later so I need to take that into consideration
Anyways, I feel like playing Light Platinum now. Should I choose Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur?
I run out of things to say easily
🎉
Originally, my first videos sounded like that; back when I did one-take webcam videos
I know we all got to start somewhere; I just wish over 3 years of YouTube would’ve helped more by now
And a little bit of FireRed
I started watching him with Paper Mario and Mother 3
I’ve seen some of his early stuff
Yes
And I have trouble faking excitement
I’m a boring person
Not much
If only I had some of Chuggaaconroy’s enthusiasm
I want to work on my voice
It’s hard to change
That’s just my voice
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I sounded bored
Meh, I’m still not a fan of my commentating 😛
It exported a couple hours ago
Anyways, it’s my nightly “I ran out of things to do and I’m bored” time now
Yeah
🎉
Only in the Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
Good. Sleep
Hooray for losing our hearing
😐
Your book makes a good fire starter
😒
You still do military stuff
Oh, and go play outside
Don’t forget the toy musket
Ugmmy
Gummy, start hating <:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
Have you been hating 🤔
Did you fall down the stairs with your laundry?
Doom Seed, wasn’t it?
😐
Yes
They do have an item that levels down a Pokemon. The opposite of rare candy
Yeah.
One thing I hate is how, you know how traded Pokémon won’t listen to you without enough badges? Well, that’s ALL Pokémon in Reborn
I’m at the 2nd gym in Reborn
<#311411150611021824>
You just need to download it and extract the file
RPG Maker
Yeah
It’s also pretty challenging if you want that.
Reborn is good. It gives off a different vibe from regular Pokémon games and it has 18 gyms; 1 for each type
Good job
Fan game
HeartGold
Meh
👌
Bad joke
Good fan game
Pokemon Reborn
I’m not sure if I’ll pass you in time
I’m glad one person liked me <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Oh hai Dan
I never played Undertale. Only watched gameplay on YouTube
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
24?
A cane?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
😛
😏
Oh, don’t forget the part where Flubs forgets his meds
Yes
1996?
🍺
Go to bed Flubs. You’re drunk
And my genes will be carried on
🦑
I don’t want the same casket as Gummy
😐
💀
Ah dam- 💣
And I die a lot from *noms something*
There was s funeral held yesterday?
I’ll start preparing his funeral
Rip
We did it
Him and his toy musket
e!gummy-b
It exploded
Truck yes
Get rid of your addiction
Too much caffeine
Mr Doctor Professor Master
Flubs: SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEK
And Gummy, you shouldn’t have so much caffeine in your system
I only went one night without sleeping. It was when I was a kid and I’m pretty sure I hallucinated that whole night
I never took the SAT’s or PSAT’s
That’s how my sleep schedule usually is. Although more till 6:30-7
Like a certain baka
Instead of just only getting 3 hours
At least you get enough sleep
I can’t get past 11. I’m only up after then if I’m just tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep
Why not always get good sleep?
But you need to make up for lost sleep
e!gummy
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
I’ll take your silence as a good
...
Is that good or bad?
🎉
And my video took 50 minutes to export and it still has to process for 8 minutes on YouTube 😑
Well, I’m starting to get bored
What does that have to do with anything, Gummy?
😛
*sees what Master is playing*
“Doot Doot Month?”
And get more sleep
Gummy, stop poking people
Oh hai Ida
💀
*noms stabbing the stab*
Do that again, Gummy...
🔪
Pet the dog
Stop poking the dog.
That seems to be the opposite of most dogs
~~he eats you~~
🎉
*noms hate*
Lol
*Sees Flubs hates me* 😡
Ok, I will not accomplish anything by chatting here. I'm getting off Discord for the next couple of hours
Then you better think twice about ignoring what I say in the future
*cringes at me being quiet*
*rolls back to audio and video editing*
Over 8 gigabytes 😐
😐
...
Why was that much on your computer
😐
Fine
Oh hai Will
<:l
I can think as much as I want
🤔
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
And a lot of talking to my thoughts
Which means I’ll get bored quickly and I’ll be lurking here most of the day
My last lazy day before I have to go back to class
I’m just being lazy
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
😑
And look where that got you
You should’ve listened
e!gummy
You should probably keep spoilers to <#311411150611021824>
As always, I don’t know what’s going on 😛
Good luck
Night
That’s it; I’m going to bed.
I have never played Majora’s Mask also
I haven’t played Chrono Trigger in years so I don’t remember
👍
I’ll probably be here for just a few more minutes, unless something interesting happens. I’m getting tired.
It’s fine
Lol
😱
Just what am I looking at? I see Discord and League, but what am I supposed to be seeing?
Last time I was in it, 6-7 people
That might be it
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
Maybe it’s not as good when more people are in it?
Good
So, you want me to talk to test your connection?
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
*shrug*
Hi fellow muted Draco
It would at least make things interesting here
That will help
Again, this feels pointless. Like, why do I even bother?
No one else is even joining
😛
No, he’s busy playing Chicken Sim 2017
My phone will be off
😑
Which will happen after I go to sleep like ALWAYS
Wow, we’ve reached a new record. This is the longest time I’ve been in Vc without Flubs popping in to do earrape
😒
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
Or actually being busy when I’m not. Or vice versa
Hooray for being introverted
This feels pointless as always
😒
😐
Well right now, it’s a podcast with no listeners <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
🤔
Well, it’s still just me. Unless you want to hear me talk to myself 😛
I’m just bored. Nothing else sounds interesting
As to be expected
*noms shadow*
*noms poking*
😐
Pet the dog. Don’t poke it
🎉
Wait, licking the pillow or licking itself on the pillow?
🐶
😒
Gummy, why don’t you follow our constant advice of telling you to go outside?
Anyways, should I play some video game, watch random YouTube videos, or just screw around here?
4 failfish; beautiful
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
e!gummy-b
😒
I’ll check if there’s any place else I can download it tomorrow. I was just looking a minute ago. I believe there’s a link on Reddit. Idk
Good Gummy
No
😒
Well, I’m at my nightly “I’m bored and I ran out of things to do” time
Never heard of it
I wonder how much that will affect me
No. I was sick the weekend I was supposed to take my SAT and I never signed up for another day
😐
I never took the SAT’s
Yes
Go to sleep
Music is also included. Like when people post an artist’s entire album on YouTube.
😒
I also don’t like having to watch stuff illegally which really hurts the creators (ex: KissAnime). I just want shows I want to watch easily accessible and legal
People not caring about tv much. I guess it’s because I haven’t gotten into Netflix or anything like that yet
Honestly, it does bug me a little
That seems to be how it is. No one cares about television anymore
Yeah
As for new episodes, even less
Just a select few
I don’t watch many shows anymore
For the 2nd time
And in Hell’s Kitchen, Ramsay kicked the red team out
If I have enough money when I move out, I’d get another pet
I’ve gotten over it
He doesn’t want to clean up after it
My dad doesn’t want another one
We don’t have any now. My dog passed away in 2015
My mom probably wouldn’t mind it. My dad is the bigger objecter
However, I don’t think my parents want another pet
There’s different hypoallergenic cats

They creep me out
I don’t want a hairless cat
If I found a nice cat that doesn’t negatively affect my allergies, then I wouldn’t mind trying to have it
I’ve only had 1 pet in my life; a dog
I wouldn’t like a pet that just sleeps all the time
I like a balance of energy and relaxing
Meh
I’ve had to deal with cat allergies which prevents me from being around them long
I like both dogs and cats. Dogs a lot more but still
Man, I wish I didn’t get so bored easily
I can watch that while being here
I’m still here
Oh, Hell’s Kitchen is on. *goes to watching*
I don’t really care what the hell people like; as long as it stays close to human
Meds?
😒
Flubs, we all know you mean to take it badly
😏
This isn’t anime. Cat girls aren’t here
😐
:pondering:
Although, I do wonder what a vlog by Eyan would look like
I know 😛
Vlog channel? Sure
360 degree? Meh
🤔
Of course I lost. Because Ninnies
Oh hai Will
I’m currently busy with the Overwatch Ninnies
What happened?
I'm only 2600 behind you
🎉
Sigh
You should be sleeping by then too
Rude
I'm always asleep by then
Rude
Aww, Gummy misses Flubs
Good, homework's done. Now I can relax for the last 2 days I have before going back to class
Lol
😏
*goes back to homework* This is more important right now
*noms something* Did that work?
*just goes up to Gummy and stabs a dart in him* There, I didn't miss
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Gummy*
Go to sleep at a reasonable time, baka
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
Discord stopped working for a few minutes for me 😑
I also want a cookie or something
I’m tired
*is not caring about anything right now*
Meh
NEIN
😠
You won’t go to bed.
You won’t go outside.
Not unless you cut eye holes in the bucket so you can see
Not possible 😛
Spending 5 1/2 hours at work with no break isn’t good
🤔
Is everyone having a better day than me?
I’m back from work, ya ninnies
That could be good and/or bad
I always miss it
Even then, I’m still weak
I’m weak because I need sleep
You see Gummy? This is how you go to bed at a reasonable time
Ok, I’m tired and I have work in the morning. Time for bed
Vc
I don’t even know why I’m in here
Bullskitty
😒
Why would you?
I’m keeping them out
No Gummy, I had my headphones out 😛
Good, Skarm didn’t steal it
I’m hungry. I want a sandwich
Softcore
I kept my headphones out 😛
Does that mean you’re out?
Adore

Fore
I see RC is still lurking
Gummy, why do you always have delayed responses? Bad internet connection?
When you should be playing outside
Most of my contacts are family
At most, I occasionally talk to one or two on the phone
Usually, it’s a good thing until I run out of things to do
Honestly
I have almost no social life
Or when I’m yelling at Overwatch Ninnies
That’s me except for my job and college
I see Flubs is still lurking
🤔
Would that be him with the 😑 face?
Joy
Well, I’m back to my usual bored state
Pfffffffft
Bullskitty
Gummy, go to bed
I’ll be the Guru of Baconators and E!Commands
I agree Draco
Gummy, you’re the Guru of Ninnies who Need To Go Outside
Good
I’m the Guru of Baconators; a made up title that does nothing
You should go outside more
Yes you are
Sigh
“Not smart” fits with Gummy
At midnight
Just go to bed...
Or sleep
e!gummy-b
Still go on time
I don’t use it
You sure?
😒
Really? Sure. Send it a private message so I can get to it later
Yes, why?
How’s everyone been tonight?
Oh hai Regal
🤔
Meds?
Oh hai Flubs
😑
Well, I’m bored. Again...
😛
Did someone say they were seeing red? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zPrOEMW60MY
I see Gummy is still being a baka...
Ok, I must go. Bye
Yes you will
Now I’m hungry
Stop taking my cookies. Both of you
Can I get a 🍪?
I did it Master

Lol
Are you trying to steal my personal or financial information?
😐

Thanks
Link?
It’s been a while
I believe so

~~SquidofButILikeDoingIt~~

*walks away*

<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Dragonoob; Dragoninny; what’s next?
See you ninnies later
Now, I must go.
Good response
Gummy is just a clown
“No”
Rude
Gummy, take these and start juggling
*throws him some balls*
Gee, I wonder who the resident clown of The Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells is...
🏈
Here, catch
Use your “powers” to go play outside
e!gummy-b
Yeah, that feels like it would be easier 😛
Just so you know, when I’ve done what you said, I’ll say “ok”
Yes
Now, how do I use this?
Ok, I believe it’s set up

Wait, I just canceled out of that. I believe it installed
“Download OBS Studio”
God dammit...
This just came up when I downloaded that software
How much of this stuff would I actually need?
Yes
I’m looking at it right now. Is “obsproject.com” the right place?
🤔
I have editing software so all I’d need is something to record video
Whatever’s free. I really don’t want to spend money on my channel; not much to gain
How would I even record that?
Brb. I need to do something
🤔
I’m not a Let’s Player. But I wouldn’t mind doing that
I thought about making a video but I don’t have any ideas
Meh
There isn’t anything I really need to do today so I don’t plan on going anywhere
Alright
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
That road grater thing
I’ve never seen anything like that
Wish I could do that
<:SeemsGood:327307864463114250>
😐
*sees pin*
Ok, for real. I’m out
😏
Bye Ninnies
Ok, I’ve lost enough brain cells here today. I’m going to bed
Who the hell is that?
Thank you
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
In the next few minutes
Well, I’m still bored. Unless someone does something entertaining, I’m just gonna go to bed
😒
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Here’s one: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbqGkS1c2w
What should I do to stop being bored?
😐
Me being bored I guess?
Idk
🤔
WHY
I’m bored
Because buying music helps support the artists better
My life?
~~e!flubs: Take your meds~~
Put socks on
Sigh...
~~SuperNinnying~~
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Hooray for typso
Only in the  Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells ™
Yes good
🤔
Sigh
Lol
e!gummy-b
I wish I could fall asleep that quickly when it's actually bed time  😑
Oh, and I’m pretty sure I slept for 10 minutes
Listen to actual good music
😑
I feel like sleeping now. And it’s only 7
😐
*noms judging*
Sigh
Don’t judge me
I know it’s a shield like thing, I think
Actually, I don’t get what that means 😛
*sees pin* 😐
*raises 🤔*
That’s Stuck’s second account
Bullskitty
😒
Who down voted them too?
🤔
That’s funny: I have none!
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
😐
I saw that
That reminded me I have online classwork to do. Despite us being on break, we still have work 😑
😛
Flubs, sleep https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K82JDbWKL7I
I’m not a fan of peppers and onions
~~More sausage 😏~~
🤔🤔🤔
😏
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
If you 🤔 then it could help you know
Flubs, if you worked that much a week, then you’d be working 15-16 hour shifts every day
Lol
110 hour shifts? 😛
I’ve never worked a 10 or 12 hour shift
The longest I’ve had to work is 8 hour shifts
Anyways, how’s everyone doing?
Lol
“You cah nave”
But there is stuff that I want to do
I don’t have to do anything tomorrow
😐
I’m back from work ya ninnies
Welp, time to step out into the rain to go to work. Sigh...
😑
Oh, good. It started to rain just a few minutes before I have to go to work. Yay...
Also, not related to that, I’m just wondering what I should do before work. 45 minutes before I need to get ready
What Ida just said
🤔
“What a baby” - Mr. Krabs
I’ve heard. I don’t care about the show much anymore.
*back to YouTube*
*noms Krabby Patty*
Oh, a battle? *Throws something at someone*
⚽
Good, now go play outside
Sigh
😏
What will he like?
But I like the 🎉 emotes
I’m back from yet another long day of work
Right now, 🍕 time
😒
Well. I got 20 more minutes before I have to go to work for the rest of the night
So far, 2 NPC's have said "Shit" 😛
It's got a pretty nice soundtrack, from what I've heard so far
Caught a shiny Ratatta literally as my first wild encounter
It's working right now
Anyways, I decided to ignore Light Platinum for now and I just downloaded Reborn. At least I don’t have to worry about an emulator with this...
Lol
I still have no idea what any of that means 🎉
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
😑
All thst time yesterday goes down the f---ing drain. I'm really pissed off now. I need to get away from this shit for a little while.
It feels like I'm just wasting my time...
Well, this f---ing sucks...
I tried restarting the rom, but the same thing happened...
😐
This is just what I wanted to see this morning...
Each time in Light Platinum, when one of my Pokemon tries to evolve, I think the game crashes
Something's not right...
I tend to get more invested in the main game later on
When playing games where you can go off to the side and find other things, I do that at first but I end up ignoring most of them later on
Uhh, some of them, I believe
But now, I’m starving
Yeah, I saw that
It’s pretty decent. Although, there are points where I feel that I could enjoy the game a little more if I was better at these tactical games
Alright. I just beat the first boss in Mario and Rabbids
Morning
I’m not far behind too
e!gummy-b
And I’ve never played those games
I’ve only played Skyrim out of those games
Which surprises me since Goat Simulator is a thing
Ok, I don’t think it’s a real game
At least, that’s what I think it is
You see, it’s a sim where you play as a chicken
And I’m just watching South Park
Seems like Flubs is too busy playing Chicken Sim 2017 to complain
🎼
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Oh hai Kugal
...
I’ll take the silence as everyone is actually doing something unlike me
How’s everyone else’s night?
I’m done with the Mario and Rabbids for the night
Telling you to play outside
That’s my help
That will help you see its beauty
e!gummy-b
Whatever floats your boat
Do your homework Master 😛
Ok, *back to Mario and Rabbids*
Probably because MLP is something a lot of people still want to avoid
Also, I saw the movie was 4th this weekend, even behind Despicable Me
...Recently put in bigger, luxury recliners which means less chairs, which means sell out quicker
She just said that they had to go to the next showing after that because they sold out. Then again, the theatre she went to...
Sigh
He’s talking about MLP
I’ll watch it if they air it on tv or somewhere else
Still, I’m not sure tactical games are really my type of game
Pretty good
99% of people never stay for the credits
It’s finally over
Well, this is a long opening cutscene
It’s not out yet
But it’s 2017 Flubs
Flubs, you couldn’t compete in a dash when you have trouble walking
Just type 1 letter per 3 seconds
Lel
Who knows? Maybe playing this could get me into XCom? Oh, it won’t but whatever
Many people have already said that 😛
*goes to the Switch*
Oh shit! I forgot I bought that Mario and Rabbids game! I got distracted by food and installing Light Platinum
Actually, I’m tired too. Not gonna nap until I feel like dropping down, but whatever
Bye Dan
JA JA JA JA JA
🤔
Why did you start calling him Flubberino? 😛
Lol
Fulbs?
Lel
Speaking of food: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw8iljkD1So
Around 2000 calories
Besides, people are supposed to have 3 square meals a day
Yeah, I could never do that, unless I started getting overweight
Maybe if you’re training for the Olympics
But can you do it for 3 meals a day?
I’ll say, I can easily eat a 1000 cal meal almost every day
Burger, fries, soda
How many calories does a Baconator meal have?
I like eating
You haven’t eaten? And eating isn’t overrated
Oh hai Dan
Anyways, the pizza was ok. I’ve had better
Well, it IS aimed towards selling toys at little girls
Brb. 🍕 time
😏
Lol
Hi
😐
🎉🤔
You really should get your tickets pretty early
My dad said that my mom had to go to a later viewing because it was sold out
Too much MLP if you ask me
😑
So don’t
😏
😏
*goes back to the Pokemon game I just installed*
Lol
Better than Gummy
Thanks for the totally realistic gun sounds
🔫
You creep
Stay away from my family
😐
And I’m busy right now
I don’t want to go to theaters to watch it
No
My mom and my niece went to see it today
Sure, I guess
:Whatever:
:stop it:
I found it out
I needed to know what that emote was called
Whatever
🤔
You know he can see that?
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
*Sees Flubs planning to hug Gummy next stream*
Ok.
The emulator started
Ok.

In the folder?
I see it
Yep
Now?
Ok
Yes
Ok, then copy it where?

This is what’s up now:
Ok. Then what?
I don’t see an Open Archive option. In the 7-Zip folder?
Yes
Yes
Ok, I downloaded it
Yeah, it’s installed
Ok, installed
Do I have to run it to install? I’m a bit dumb when it comes to detailed computer stuff 😛
It’s downloaded
Just a second. I remember I looked at this before
32 or 64 bit?
By Wolverale
Uhh, I don’t think so
Anyways, I believe I’m ready Draco
Ironically
~~e!flubs: Flubs, you’re a baka~~
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Haha you guys said that
I come back to this...
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Well, alright then. I’m just getting lunch and doing one other thing right now
<@!218843275824463872> So, I will probably be able to start looking for an emulator in a little while. I’ll let you know when I’m ready. Just letting you know
59% done
It’s been an hour and it says it still has 44 minutes
Ok, this time remaining thing isn’t accurate
Good, it will only take 50 minutes to download. I don’t know why Mario Kart 8 Deluxe took 4 hours when I got it
I know
Ok, why is every game I want $60 😑
Never played XCom; all I’ve seen of it is what Eyan has played
I think I’ll buy that Mario and Rabbis crossover
Guess I’ll just sit here and 🤔
So e!go outside isn’t an option
Well, I’m getting bored. It’s raining right now so I don’t feel like going anywhere 😑
Alright
Morning
TM
*shoots tranquilizer dart* There, now sleep
And I planned to sleep. Which I did
Beep beep boop bop boop beep
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
A THING?
You’re not RiceGum or Jake Paul. No diss tracks
Lol
Uhh...Eyan you stink
Eyan better not be asleep
Oh hai Animal Man
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
e!gummy
I’ll yes...
*just waiting for the stream*
<:Comcast:338562329509756928>
Sigh
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
“Dragonanny” 😐
Anyone but Jake Paul
Chuggaaconroy
*noms snack*
💀
No
I only censor f~~~
😏
I like caramel popcorn
Like <:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
I’m going to watch YouTube until the stream. *kicks Gummy and runs back to YouTube*
Anyways, I was going to say that I used to see notifications in my email that Eyan was streaming and I always thought: “Meh, I don’t care about that game. What’s on YouTube?”
😐
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
That’s when I started following Eyan on Twitch, but I didn’t start actively watching until this year
I don’t remember
And SquidofBaconator?
Play with this 🏀
e!gummy-b
Gummy, <:Nay:327308337706434570>
Although, I have been slowly losing interest in it
And I do
My Little Pony, Dan
🤔
Gummy, instead of watching the MLP movie, watch some Star Wars and Lord of The Rings
I can’t tell what that is. MOBILE
e!gummy
😒
Nothing
I’m happy. I just bought some Cinnabon cereal that I haven’t had in years 😃
I’m back ya ninnies
Anyways, time to go to work. See you ninnies at the stream later; if you’re there
Nah. I still like 🤔
*noms the nomming the think*
<:Downvote:316033532684140544>
Flubs: NO THINK.
🤔
I once rickrolled people in a video
Bullskitty
I remember making videos in high school. 99% of them sucked
*throws Gummy out and locks the 🚪* Here, play with this 🏈
*noms circles*
e!gummy-b
I’ll say “Gummy was finally playing outside when a bulldozer ran over him”
Bulldozers are funnier
I should be out of work in time for the stream. That is, if he does it at 8
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Sigh
That doesn’t answer my question
😐
So, what the hell is going on now?
I’ll take the silence as a no
...
I have to work later. Can someone go in for me or give me a good excuse to give them for not going? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
😐
I need new shows to watch. And Steven Universe to get more episodes out
I’m not sure if I’ll still be watching much of Season 8 when it comes out
You’re getting through it fast
And by nobody, you mean just Flubs
Sleep is for those who want to think clearly
🤔
Sleep is for people who want to be somewhat healthy
I’ve spent more for less
Now, if there’s nothing else going on, I’m gonna sleep. Good night ninnies
Well, this was some nice fast food talk
And both of them are better than Burger King
Wendy’s is better
McDonald’s is only good for its breakfast. The rest of it is mediocre
Speaking of Five Guys: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DcJFdCmN98s
I only like Arby’s fries
Five Guys is F—ing amazing
Aaaaand no more Discord. Thanks Dragonoob...
On the topic of getting sick, I haven’t eaten at Arby’s in years because both me and my dad got sick last time we went there
The same went for their grilled chicken when I had it; I actually got sick from it
Last time I got the original, it was sitting in a puddle of grease
KFC is overrated. I will say, if you go there, don’t get the original. Get the crispy chicken. The original is awful
😐
I’m hungry
*cuts up chicken*
🔪
Yeah. I saw the fandub
Also, you guys know Animal Crossing has a movie?
But I did enjoy some parts of Chugga’s LP of New Leaf
Meh. Animal Crossing isn’t something I really have much interest in
I already did that
Any ideas?
Well, I don’t want to go to sleep yet, but I have nothing left to do
Pre level up 🎉
“I think that cop just needs some friends”
“Possible Autobiography” 
Stephen: So, I got pulled over by a cop once. He was an asshole.
Like the recent one where Stephen got pulled over by a cop
I also watch the vlogs
Well, now I know of 2 more people who watch StephenPlays
I just saw that in my subscription feed. I’m going to watch that too
I’m back from work once again, ninnies
💀
Anyways, I need to get ready for work. Later, ya Ninnies
You also have Season 7 Gummy
“Kill me” - Gummy
I could’ve done better
They were shield surfing in BoTW and a couple of them didn’t do very well 😑
Ok, a couple of these kids look like they have no idea what they are doing
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
Dinner
Lunch at 5pm is dinner
🤔
Well, I won’t be passing you tonight
😐
Then a step closer to nothing
How far away am I from you Draco?
🎉
*goes to watch the Nintendo World Championship*
Either your leg or your cane again
*noms something else*
Dammit, and that didn’t waste enough time...
Done
🏘 🔥
I have half an hour before I need to get ready for work. What should I do?
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
*noms something* I’m bored
I don’t want to go to work later. 😑
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
*SIGH*
I hate hot sauce outside of buffalo sauce
Yes. I’ve played both and I agree
🤔
If I’m here, then yes
My internet stopped working for a little while 😑
😐
The thing that’s in between your house and wherever you get your food
Inferior, that’s why we call this place the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
GUMMY IS A CANADIAN TERRORIST
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
You went from Russian anthems to bagpipes 😑
He died recently
Rip
😏
🏈
Your milk should give you the strength to play with this:
e!gummy-b
JA
It’s up the steps
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
Back to drinking tea again 🍺
💀
😐
Lol
Without falling down stairs <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I need to do laundry now
Idk
There is a British version of Hell’s Kitchen
I looked it up
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
😑
I believe it’s to cater to different tastes in humor, for better or for worse
I think I might’ve only seen clips
Does Hell’s Kitchen also have a British version?
And the girls are getting into fighting 😛
Just something stupid I heard
Hell’s Kitchen
Someone said “cray cray” in this episode 😑
Night Ida
I do like the US version despite the flaws. As for those 2 shows, Survivorman
The US version feels more staged like every other reality show here
I can see that
Since we’re talking about Ramsay
Watch this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGz2md8l28
Then again, most of those restaurants are over 100k in debt. There’s no saving that
I was alright with it. Then again, I’m fine with most
😴
💀
One minor thing I don’t like about Hell’s Kitchen is how just about all the chefs smoke
🎉
Oh, you don’t like Gordon Ramsay? 😛
Ok, Ramsay kicked out the red team
How many times has he died?
Oh god
Oh hai Wolverale
So far, no hilarious rage or food comparisons
He made the chefs apologize for poor steak
Eh, it’s already dead
Ramsay punched some salmon
Ramsay is getting angry
I believe they have people from past seasons
I don’t see why I wouldn’t watch it 😛
So, Hell’s Kitchen is still airing new episodes 😐
Tips should be given to those who provide good service, not because society forces/pressures you to
And you feel incredibly pressured to ALWAYS give your waiters/waitresses tips
Probably
He wanted a tip
Gummy always wants someone to talk to him
Lol
Wait, what?
I wouldn’t really enforce a punishment against myself 😛
I really wish I could get more time out of the games I play
I wish I didn’t get bored so quickly
Ok then
I’ll try in a second
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
Because I egg it on sometimes <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I think if I come, he’ll do it
“Yellow Cancer Balls” 
And yes RC, he would do that
Does Someone hate that?
🤔
Flubs: *YES. SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEAK*
Guys, I ended up sleeping for a little while a few hours ago and I feel like taking a nap again. Is something wrong with me? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I’m already confused
<:LUL:305559915714576385>
Why not have something with that garlic bread? One of my favorite sandwiches is a chicken parmesan sandwich with garlic bread for the bread
BBBBBBBBB
Uhh, I have NASCAR Heat 2 which I might switch to. There aren’t very many games I have that I want to replay or keep playing. I already played the games on my Switch quite a bit so I’m a little tired of those. I might get a new one
What else should I play?
I’m definitely not going back to Overwatch for a while. I’ve had it with that game
Lel
Well, now that the classwork is done, I have nothing to do
So, how’s everyone else doing?
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
At least until next Friday because online class doesn’t get a break...
And with that, I’m finished with my online classwork and I’M FREE FROM COLLEGE WORK!!!
🎉
Technically this is a 9 day weekend for me.
By Spanish 4, no one knew what we were doing 😛
The teacher was a nice person, but a mediocre teacher
I barely remember anything
I said that I studied Spanish for 4 years but my Spanish is very bad
I just felt like doing it
Lol
Yo estudio Español por cuatro años pero mi Español es muy mal
In college, it’s more along the lines of 60, but it varies a little by class
At my high school, you would need a 70
So, is above 50 a passing grade?
Yeah, most kids don’t really care about any of the work in high school
If it was the easiest assignment ever, then why did only 4 people pass?
Proud of a 60% 😑
60% is an F back in my high school
Anyways, *back to work*
I don’t know how I did it or how I got a B- in it
For my summer English class, I did all my papers the day before they were due
I usually only need to spend an hour a week on it, but it can be a pain if you wait until the last day to do it. And yes, I’m a REALLY bad procrastinator.
Online classwork really is a pain in the ass to keep up with if you don’t remain on top of it
If it interests you, I linked one of the websites I’m using for this in <#311411150611021824>
Right now, Light Platinum is the first one I’m interested in
Looking at different games, to be more specific
I’m going to look more into it sometime over break
Yes, that’s it
I’ve only watched some on YouTube but it’s been a couple years.
More on the fan made side.
You know, recently I’ve been wanting to try Pokemon rom hacks. I’ve been starting to get interested in them again
It was only for less than an hour
I ended up sleeping for a little while. 😑
It’s great unless you want a social life outside of talking to Ninnies on the internet
I just spend my time doing nothing
The days have been blending together for me recently
Then again, it was only yesterday when he changed it. I think 😛
Did you just notice?
I still need to do my online classwork before I can fully relax for this break week
Good night Ninnies

<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
e!gummy
I never know what’s going on here
*gives Flubs a guitar*
Up to 5th grade for us
In elementary school we played it
I know
👍
Good
He’s talking about playing with toy muskets and transformers
*noms broken toy musket*
This is the 1st time I’ve heard Will talk
What did they do?
So.... how’s the weather?
Was this after you had trouble walking
🍪
Oh hai Will
🤔
What am I hearing in the background?
OOOOOHHH
Hanging out with females Gummy? 😏
No 😏?
Lol
That’s random
RC
And I kept saying something
Punch your pillow or something
When both you and Gummy are around, yes
Probably
He doesn’t like the MLP talk
I’m not going to theaters to see it
Yeah
I’m the only one who will talk MLP with you
Twilight is not my favorite
Gummy, stop being impatient
Nice keyboard ASMR
Too impatient
Bye Animal Man
10
I can keep saying something
I can interrupt this if it interests anyone 😛
This reminds me of my first time listening in on vc. It was just everyone listening to Gummy
Waiting for what?
They deserve time alone <:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
Nah, I won’t do it
😏
Flubs is talking to Gummy again
...4
AND I DID MY HOMEWORK
Figure out the parental timer or just leave here
Wow...
🎉
Then you can join vc and hear Flubs eat
Figure out how to change it fast
Wow...
We’re glad we can’t hear it
🍺
Now it’s just you eating
Ok, this is pointless
Aww
I have my headphones out
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Are you sure you guys don’t want in on the earrape?
Anyways, if anyone wants to join in on this vc “fun” come on in. It’s boring with just Flubs
DAMMIT SKARM
🍪
I saw it at the last second
Thanks for that Flubs
Well, I’m in vc for no reason.
NEIN
JA
🤔
He can make earrape videos that get millions of views
~~How’s it going bros? It’s FLUUUUUBS!~~
“The Green Pewdiepie” XD
~~SLEEP IS FUR THA WEEEAK~~
For me, I can sleep from 11-7. That’s my schedule
😏
Then sleep soon
Or stay up, lose more brain cells, and be bored with me
Anyways, RC. If you have something to do tomorrow morning, then go to sleep
If you have nothing to do tomorrow, then stay up.
Do you have anything to do tomorrow?
God, I really wish I could be bored less. I know I say it a lot, but I have a hard time staying interested in what I’m doing
I don’t really care; I just type it out when it feels like good timing 😛
I’m not original in general 😛
😒
~~e!flubs: Go play outside, Flubs~~
Sigh
I’m not good at talking, so that translates to my chatting
I don’t get it
😑
I’m still not getting one. Ever since I started getting the games since Diamond, I have ALWAYS gotten one of the games. This is the 1st time in 10 years this has happened
Uhh, why is Ultra Sun and Moon a thing?
Or “Don’t be an asshole to me when I’m working as a cashier”
😛
My life advice doesn’t go further than “Don’t be a Gummy”
Regal left?
Wait, what?
Here, not really
I honestly hate most people
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
*makes a joke about stairs*
😏
KappaPride makes it perfect
😂
Were you ever going to actually speak 🤔
Night Ida
Gummy, it will be
Earrape bait
“Words”
All I hear from Flubs is earrape
Flubs, I thought you hated music
🎵
Only song title puns
Yep
Whatever floats your boat https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NLd83AxoL3c
There’s a song with floor in the title
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-FyjEnoIgTM
Sing about the floor? Hang on
The “Gummy wants to video chat with you” list
I haven’t played Skyrim in months
You’re green now
You advanced to level 1
*begins to chant* TALK TO FLUBS.
TALK TO FLUBS.
Talk to Flubs
I’m glad I’m not involved
Good
👍
If I’m at a computer, I will totally not do video chat with Gummy
The “I hate think” Bandwagon
Animal Man, stop jumping on the bandwagon
🤔
Why should I even bother?
Well, Discord hates me then. I can never get the good stuff
So....is mobile included in video chat or does Discord hate me ?
I’m an introvert so I’m not comfortable with talking to people whom I don’t know irl
Only once
I have never done a video chat before. The closest thing I’ve done is a Skype Call
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
I did my math homework
Anyways, will video chat be on mobile too or do they hate me?
Lol
I see someone kept 🎉 my 😐
😐
Or nothing?
~~may I suggest a block of wood instead? It’s more helpful~~ <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Get a new computer
Lol
<@!178655272796028928> It’s SPLATOON
That has nothing to do with anything Skarm
1) I quit playing Overwatch for the night. I don’t enjoy playing it much anymore
2) Flubs, you just killed me. AGAIN
Did the drug head eat your homework?
It doesn’t make me hyper. Also, I already had 2 glasses today
Tea doesn’t keep you awake. Some of it will help you sleep
Without coffee. I hate coffee
Well, how do you propose I stay awake?
I knew you would say it
I feel like sleeping now
I feel unusually tired
Flubs did
I’m bored
LOOOOOSER
NEEEEEERD
I already did my homework
Can we find a better joke?
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Fried water 😐
Sigh
Boo
😐
I only played TF2 on it and I barely played it, so I didn’t want Steam on my computer
I have an account but I uninstalled it from my computer
Never mind
...
Ok, so is it a farming game?
Since I don’t have any interest in looking into it, there’s a 99.9999% chance I won’t get it
Lol
But I’m lazy too 😐
I need a better explanation on these games 😛
Aaaand I don’t know what that is either
What type of game is Stardew Valley?
*noms it* That won’t work
Or any PC games
I don’t have any interest in starting League
I can’t keep playing a mode in which I have absolutely no fun in
Ok, I’m temporarily quitting Overwatch Competitive Play. It’s just awful...
Still have terrible Overwatch luck 😑
We get 2 full weeks of each semester
I really need a break. I’m feeling very stressed
I have all next week off 🎉
I think I might just quit Competitive Play in Overwatch. I’m just having horrible luck here
I think I just suck at Overwatch 😑
Busy with the Overwatch Ninnies
Oh hai Kugal
Fine
Oh hai Will
*back to Overwatch*
Anyways...
That would probably only please Flubs
😐
Just THINKING
I’m still here
😏
~~like Flubs~~
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Because ninnies
So much <:FailFish:327304577261240322>
😐
Bullskitty
By people, you mean Flubs
Do you just like deleting my messages 😑
Oh hai Chewy
*noms not noticing*
*noms toothpick*
Don’t poke my violin
*plays worlds smallest violin*
😐
Not how I want to spend my time but whatever
I’m just trying to finish my homework for tomorrow
I remember at my school, at least once a year, some kid would get arrested for possession of drugs
😏
“Do all sorts of fun things” eh Flubs?
Be back later
Time for dinner
So...
No hooray?
...
HOORAY FOR WORK
I PROBABLY WILL TOO
🎉
I have NO SCHOOL NEXT WEEK
I had pumpkin spice pancakes before
Lul
They’re cheap and easy to make
I’m eating my own pancakes
*nom pancakes*
🥞
I’m not watching It
The Stephen King version or the recent one
Never seen it
Nah
The episode Club SpongeBob
It’s a SpongeBob reference
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
WELCOME SQUIDWARD.
WELCOME SQUIDWARD.
WELCOME SQUIDWARD.
Today is just meh
Meh
Oh hai Animal Man
Sigh
Ok, who else down voted that?
🤔
They’re things that you use to tell you what you need to do
Yep, still nothing
My current plans: nothing
Lol. Ok, I think I’ll go to lab now
That’s referring to HeartGold right?
Lol
Hear any good jokes lately?
When it comes to waiting I wish these few minutes weren’t the slowest that pass
Ok, 6 more minutes
Lol. It’s a cute art style.
👍
Yeah
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
*sees new profile pic*
God, I hate just waiting for Bio lab...
Why would you even be able to?
Then it would be all:
Flubs: STOP THINK <:Downvote:316033532684140544> 
Me: <:Thinking:325447327940870145>
Too bad Flubs isn’t here
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
🤔🤔
This isn’t even easy so that’s not an answer
Any thoughts?
Anyways, changing topics, I don’t really know how I’m doing this well in college. I’m lazy, I procrastinate, I barely study or put effort into my classes, and it feels like I have no idea as to what the hell I’m doing. Yet, I’m pretty sure I don’t have a grade lower than a B
HA
~~be a Baconator~~
😛
I’m just showing this  face of Squidward for laughs
Oh
🤔
Yes
Also, I’ve been meaning to ask, what’s your profile picture of?
🎉
Relying on other people to do the work 😛
I probably won’t have a clue to what I’m doing but that’s how it always is
I might go to bio lab a little early. The professor said she’ll be there if we want to start early. So I can go home earlier
And now I’m bored
And now I’m full
Watching food videos while hungry should be illegal
Note to self: don’t watch food videos on YouTube when hungry
That’s useless to me
Don’t mind me, I think the hunger is helping drive me more insane
*Just eat something SquidofBaconator* But I won’t be hungry for lunch then, thoughts
I really hate being hungry yet lunch isn’t served for another half hour.
😑
Yaaaaay
And now, the wait begins
Class is boring
Anyways, it’s time for class. Be back soon since today’s my weekly “Wait 2 1/2 hours for Bio lab” day
It was that bad
First time it happened to me, I vomited
I’ve had blood taken when I’ve gotten blood work done. I always get nauseous
I know what a liter is. Isn’t that a lot? I know I’m not good at giving blood, so I could never do that 😛
😐
A liter?
I’ve never really watched esports before
Is this a League thing?
🎉
You will be history if you don’t stay healthy
You need the fresh air and exercise
Gummy, why don’t you go do something of more importance? Like playing outside
Or nom a Baconator
Or drink green drink
A story trailer was recently released?
I honestly have no interest in getting them
Why are you getting them?
Well, I’m bored again. I get bored too easily
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
👍
I’m just chilling with this livestream. Here to chat
⚽
Just play with this Gummy:
Now you got my presence here
Ok, I can stay here while watching the livestream
Go outside Gummy
Ok, the livestream I want to watch is starting. Be back soon
😏
e!gummy-b
I ACTUALLY WON FOR ONCE 🎉
Aaaand 1st objective lost 😑
Really ninnies? 3 attackers when we’re defending?
😏
I CAN’T STOP LOSING
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
SAME GUY
STOP DYING YOU NINNY
Good, 1 healer is Attack now
Aaaaand we lost. FUUUUUU
The same Soldier 76 is the only one killing me
THESE GUYS SUCK
Need more attack people
Dammit, 2 healers 😑
Later, I’ll probably go watch a livestream that a YouTuber I watch is doing
Ok, time to get angry at the Overwatch Ninnies again 🎉
Idk. I just like that emote 😛
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
WELLLLLL 🤔
Well

English, I do good
Me no care
😒
I don’t know much of anything about Fantastic 4 😛
No
Well, we’re all dead now
*noms world*
*noms meat lovers pizza* Haven’t had that in a while
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
*noms something that regular people eat*
😐
I’ll take the lack of responses as a no
Has anyone else had it?
Although recently, I’ve been wanting to have that Cinnabon cereal. I haven’t had it in years but I remember liking it. And I’ve been getting a craving for it.
I don’t like eating many new things
I’m still picky
You want to be salty? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Those are good
How about a holiday ham?
I like both turkey and chicken
Turkey pizza?
*noms turkey*
I like turkey. Especially fried turkey
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
*bot blows up in Gummy’s face*
I don’t plan on seeing the movie in theaters
Oh right, Canadian Thanksgiving. I believe that’s Columbus Day for us
What’s happening? Gummy watching a movie?
I can’t help but THINK at that line
👌 Pin
So when you fall down these?
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
Is it your thinking time?
🤔
I’m back to not knowing what to do again
If anyone’s interested, I linked to the website in <#311409240327585802>
Oh! I just found out the podcast I was apart of is up!
It needed more content. Like a good single player. And more maps that aren’t paid DLC
I played the first EA Battlefront. It was a vacant game
😐
Everyone is awful. Except for very few people
I don’t play League
Well, what’s going on?
🤔🤔🤔
I’m back from work ya ninnies
Later
Ok, time to get ready for work. Maybe I’ll be back later. Maybe I won’t...
Oh, of course I will; I don’t have a life or anything else to do <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
I don’t know what that is 😛
“I’m a ghost for just today”
What good excuse can get me out of that? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I just realized I have to go to work in 15 minutes
.7 😐
To get a GPA more than that or more than 3 hours of sleep? <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
If we’re talking about that, I have a 3
😐
I got 7 1/2. I think
I got good grades on both of my tests that I didn’t study much for. I’m happy
🤔
Lol
🤔
Lol
*goes back to  Overwatch*
Wish I didn’t get so bored quickly 😐
All I really need to do before break next week is stuff for my online class
I love how, in that pins archive, there is just Eyan saying “No” six times in a row 😛
Now, to relax until I have to go to my job
Hai. I got my homework done and I just had a Baconator 👍
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
EYANCHAMP FTW
🎉
I GOT AN 86. HOLY SHIT
Yep.
Yes
👍
Morning. Probably not going to be around much longer. Class starts soon
This should be the last stressful day before break next week
😑
And I have to stay at the building to do an assignment that can only be done here. AND before I have to go to work
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I’m pretty sure I failed. I’ll be lucky if I get a D
I probably will when I see the score on my Statistics test I’m getting back today
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
Ok, I’m leaving for real now. Always
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
Good night ~~role model~~ ninnies
Ok, I’m starting to doze off so I’m going to bed now
Be like SquidofBaconator. Just be lazy
Oh hai RC
Lol
Instead of drinking, you should spend your time 🤔
That’s the path to becoming an alcoholic
Are you just interested in getting drunk?
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
I’m picky when it comes to my food and drinks
Doubt it
🤔
I just don’t have much interest in drinking. All I’d like to know is how some of that stuff tastes
Being a model Baconator?
I’m such a model citizen. Or Baconator
I just don’t drink
Someone will ask for ID
Wow
Still illegal
😑
Haven’t you made jokes about underage drinking Flubs?
🤔
Well, Stuck’s Dad?
*takes Gummy outside then runs back in and locks the door* There, now you can play outside now
I’ll go if you go
🏈
e!gummy-b
*noms broken toy* There, fixed
I’M BACK FROM MAH JOB YA NINNIES
Don’t mind me, I’m just another introverted ninny Losing my brain cells
*I don’t know SquidofBaconator* Of course YOU don’t know. Your my thoughts. If you knew, then I would know
Because I have to work a shift longer than intended because the other employee is “being admitted.” I know I said that once before but I still don’t know what that means
6 1/2 hours from now
And now, I will only be here for a few more minutes. I have to go to work. Then I won’t be around until 9:30
Ok, I ate what I consider to be more than one slice
I’m eating the rest of this apple pie my mom made. Enough for 1 1/2 slices, but I’m eating it all 😛
Pie time ❤
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
I’m always tired
🎉
Got an 80 on my bio exam. B-
Anyways, time to go to class
I have no idea what you’re talking about
That’s...not good. I think 😛
Nice to meet you triggered
I’m tired
I think I’ll just go to bed now. Later Introverted Ninnies
Ok, this looks like the usual Kingdom Of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells night
*sees pin* You play with it every night? 😏
Oof
Wait, I forgot. I was going to play a video game 😐
I got class...
Should I just go to sleep too?
Well, I’m bored
Well, good night
*offers energy drink*
Into the dirt...
e!gummy-b
Sigh
🍔
Yep
💩
🎉
Quiet you
😐
No
HAHAHAHA 💀
Ok, my chest is hurting a little when I laugh right now. Is that bad?
*Hugs Gummy because he’s a tsundere to hugs*
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
It’s always about his legs
😏
BOOOO
Gengar
😏
Boo
I’m just a Squid Baconator
I’m forced to talk at my job
Masterpiece?
~~Phantom of The Opera~~
👀
Or Master
Neither am I
😛
Sing in vc again tonight? Duet with Master?
*noms the musket*
<#321777310057627655> For proof
Pokemon XYZ
“Knock me down I’ll just get up again” That’s part of a Pokemon theme
Pokemon theme?
🤔
“Where’s the Lamb SAUCE?!”
From the Baconator
Ketchup
They are?
🔪 
No
I’ll stick to my doughnuts
🍙
*noms salt* Mmm, it’s salty
😡😡😡
What’s that reaction?
F—ING NINNIES
THESE NINNIES ARE AWFUL
Wow, this team sucks now...
I think I’m Gold
So, how do I tell how I’m ranked?
We won because I was so good as Mercy
You know what? I’M MERCY NOW
😡
A Tracer keeps killing me...
In Skirmish for 2 1/2 minutes before match 😑
*noms ha ha and lol*
FUUUIUUUU
Shit, I had to leave right before the match even started and it still counted as a placement match
Don’t distract me
*back to Overwatch*
😏
I’m coming back
Ok, unless someone has anything ground breaking to say, I’m going back to Overwatch
I don’t have it
Night people leaving
That’s how I Level up...

😏
“You gotta but it”
Isn’t Garfield Cart for DS?
~~Overwatch~~
Fallout 4
😐
Want me to dab?
*noms bite*
<#311402910820859914>
HANG ON A SECOND
I REMEMBERED SOMETHING
OH WAIT
You won’t be seeing reruns at all of Regular Show
Have you watched Pet Sitter Pat?
Face Freeze
Regular Show was great, but again, I lost interest
The old SpongeBob episodes are great
They’re already selling toys for the movie
It’s for the toys
It’s been on too long for me to keep interest in it
Honestly, with MLP, I have been losing interest in it this season
Welcome back Ida
Lol
WITH ME
YES
No, with me
~~Flubs, Watch MLP with me~~
I’m not going to be in the same room as 5 year old girls and 25 year old men with the movie
I’m not watching the movie in theaters
Maybe?
I should get back to Overwatch
PLAY WITH THE FOOTBALL
Now go outside
Gummy, hold on.
To this 🏈
Oh, you’re back to Flubs
<:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Bad
Dammit...
I read Garfield. Does that count?
FUUUU
No
Reading is overrated
🤔
What the hell is going on...
Brb Ninnies here and Overwatch Ninnies
Okaaaaay, screw that. Time to get my flu shot. Yaaaaay...
I need to win both of them to get 5-5, but that’s stretching it
I have 2 more placement matches to go through, might as well lose my sanity 💀
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I already do that here 😛
Anyways, should I play Overwatch or keep my sanity?
It wasn’t a match for this bacon cheeseburger
That pie is just so good 😛
*noms more apple pie*
Well, I just finished dinner. 👍
Xanthor is made of this ice cream
🤔
🐔 and 🥔
*goes to dinner*
😏
Again
Bullskitty
I was doing ASMR
I wasn’t screaming
*noms alarms* There, fixed
Bullskitty

I’m slightly above ugly
I ain’t ugly
I can still look angry
😡
😐
😐
Oh
Dammit, I need that...
*noms something*
But you’re Xanthor. Where’s Flubs?
😏
You’ll be with the ninnies; your own kind
Play Overwatch
But you like stealing sandwiches
Skarm, want a sandwich?
I don’t like guacamole
What type?
😐
*noms 🐔*
Yeah
I’m hungry
Gummy, stop showing up to conversations late
Ja
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
😐
Flubs is gone. Xanthor is taking his place
Bullskitty
👍
Because you can beat people up? 😛
What do you like?
Golf-nation 😛
😐
I like golf
Also, *makes Animal Man play golf*
🤔
Ok, I hate this feeling. I don’t have to do anything for the rest of the night yet I feel like I need to do something
~~e!gummy-u: Stop playing UNO, Gummy~~
I’m doing research on nothing today
Also, I keep forgetting that I have to go back to class tomorrow
Do your work
e!gummy
Wow
I went with a bunch of jackasses
I know. I was in high school once
Only a couple professors assign seats. They may ask to not sit in the back
A couple kids were throwing coins in study hall once
Paid by the minute
I could last 3 seconds
*rolls nowhere* I’m on a flat couch
~~e!gummy’s friends~~
Feels like they’re arguing most of the time anymore. It’s a real f— ing pain
And now my parents are home and yelling. Yay...
So there was this anime that *weeb message removed by a sane person*
😏
Lol
Big Brother? The TV show? I didn’t watch it much 😛
I’d rather not get into a fight over politics. It’s a pain in the ass to not go a day without hearing something that’s going on.
But deep political talk should be meant for other places
We’re going to need more than that
Almost 60 dead and 500 injured
It began right as Jason Aldean started a song
I saw some videos
I’m 138
Anyways, how’s everyone doing today?
*Looks like Gummy’s blowing away agaaaain*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Everyone’s coming in now
Oh hai RC
Stuck isn’t here. Xanthor is here
Wow, last night, there was that shooting in Vegas and now he’s dead...
Wait, he died?
Maybe
Or this ice cream
I probably like Xanthor not as much as Flubs
The meep made everyone silent
Meep
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUCLnN56f0
Not as much as that Flubs guy
No response or reaction. So Xanthor doesn’t hate 🤔
...
WALK WALK WALK 🤔 WALK
Isn’t that jaywalking?
We’re talking about jobs and assholes 😛
Oh hai Will
Sick? Fired? I’m not sure
My day was nice. Although, I now have to work a longer shift tomorrow night because the employee is “being admitted.” I don’t know what that means
😑
Again
😑
Was someone an asshole to you today at Soooubway, Xanthor?
Why the question?
Maybe to cashiers. Then we’ll get some respect
🤔
🎉🎉
And no homework for tonight so double
🎉
I didn’t have class because it was cancelled by the professor. And I don’t have to work
So, do you either have to pack your own lunch or just go home?
Oh right, school food is awful
Why not just eat there?
I hope I did decent on my two tests. One I think I did alright on. The other, 😨
🤔
Go play outside
e!gummy
I have no idea what that is
Lol
Not really appropriate after what I just said 😐
I just found out some terrible news.
I just heard about a shooting in Las Vegas with over 50 people deceased
Hi.
~~Someone change his name to Tired~~
Thanks
<:(
Have fun Skitty-Ing out 😛
The pancakes are probably microwaveable too
Whatever’s quick and cheap
I normally only eat eggs on a breakfast sandwich
I’m not an egg fan to begin with
Yeah, the eggs are usually my least favorite part
Pancakes, sausage, hash brown, eggs, and a biscuit
😑
God, I don’t know why I bother getting a big breakfast with 🥞 from McDonald’s. It fills me up too much and I couldn’t finish it
Ok, I’m going to sleep. Later Ninnies
😂
And now it’s just Xanthor
And since he left
I’m too nervous to sing 😑
*slow clap*
👍
How about I sing Body Like A Backroad? 😛
👍 then
You’re never in vc when I’m around. This could be good or bad
Or me
Gummy, you can’t even hear us
Would it make you feel better if I sang? My voice gives even the worst of singers confidence
👍
I’m gonna play music just to annoy Flubs 😛
I might play music. Not good, mind you
Pop. Pop music?
Good job wolverale
😐
👍
Come in
Back to Flubs
And me coughing
You’re missing out. On background noise...
Then I jumped into vc for nothing
😐
Hey, Demon Lord’s here! Ready to kill his hearing too!
Why don’t you play soothing music here? Then it will be abruptly interrupted by The Earrape by Flubs
Maybe in a couple days
Anyone want to join in?
I’m in vc, killing my hearing 😛
Bye Kugal
🤔
Ok, nothing’s on YouTube. All that’s left to do is chill here with the ninnies. Or go into vc and have Flubs and/or Master kill my hearing
Wait, where’s the censor? 😛
My voice would make you want to strangle a cat
Ok, so we need to get Gummy an instrument
🤔
So, Eyan as lead vocalist, I play the clarinet, and Flubs has mayonnaise. Gummy and Kugal?
And Eyan would be lead vocalist
Oh right
What instrument would I play?
👌
Seriously, I get too much enjoyment out of this. I’m dying 😂
I love it
Having fun Master?
I can’t stop laughing 😂
e!gummy
I get too much enjoyment out of this
😐
😃
I just thought of something. Wouldn’t it be funny if mine and Kugal’s profile pictures were looking at each other? It would be Tom and Squidward giving each other funny faces 😛
Night Ida
No
😐
No ice cream when I’m around
*steals raspberry ice cream*
⛽️
🍔
Or 🍙
Try 🍔
GO PLAY OUTSIDE GUMMY <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
e!gummy
Watch YouTube, play video games, or go into vc for Master and/or this ice cream to blow my ear drums out
Ok, what should I do for the rest of the night?
👍

Wait, where did my 3DS go 😨

Oh hai Kugal
Perfect
TM TM TM TM TM TM TM
e!gummy-b
The TM is important
We just keep extending that name...
😐
Wait, what’s going on...
I don’t have anyone to consent to anything 😑
Did you two even know each other back then

Depends
“I got a rock”-Charlie Brown and this ice cream
Sigh
Why were you throwing up?
🤔
No negative reactions. It’s official. Flubs/this ice cream doesn’t hate thinking anymore
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
So, does this ice cream not hate thinking?
🤔🤔🤔
Taylor Swift isn’t going to touch you
MY CABBAGES
:cabbage:
:trash:
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
THIS ice cream needs you Gummy
😏
*chases Gummy* Get Back here. Flubs needs you
“I wouldn’t touch you with a 39 1/2 foot pole”
Grinch reference
Don’t you mean a 39 1/2 foot pole?
I meant, put clothes over you like they’re a blanket
I knew you weren’t wearing pants...
*pokes Gummy*
Or use your clothes as blankets
Then go buy some
What....
😏
Get more blankets
Turn up the heat
🤔
*noms this ice cream’s bad joke*
Nothing’s on tv as usual...
🎉
😏
“This Flubs cream”...
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
🤔
👍
And this ice cream looks like this ice cream
I was quoting the song
😐
I WANNA ROCK
🤔
😂
Some red ones
Idk
Apple Pie
No
👌
DELICIOUS
Here’s the pie in which I had a slice today

😏
McDonald’s doesn’t have Ben & Jerry’s...
Just gotta go before 8am, then it gets really busy
Ok, McDonald’s with the Big Breakfast it is.
😒
Although, I could drive 15 minutes for a plate size pancake
I’m not driving 30 minutes just for IHOP
Anyways, back on topic, I think I’ll get breakfast. I might get a Big Breakfast with Hotcakes. Yeah, it’s a ton of food that’s incredibly bad for me, but I can eat it and I don’t care
😒
Every time I eat it, I vomit horribly
Lol
😏
I drink milk all the time
No
And I hate bananas
I can’t eat ice cream
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Either McDonald’s for breakfast or Wendy’s for lunch
Yes <:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
🤔
I don’t want to spend too much money
Anyways, should I go out for breakfast or lunch?
Lol, was that my one long message? 😛
I’m trying to figure out if I want to go get something for breakfast or lunch tomorrow
On the bright side, I don’t have work tomorrow and my class was cancelled so 🎉
And then the ATM ran out of money with a half hour before I could go which made things EVEN WORSE
The thing for credit/debit transactions wasn’t working so people could only pay with cash or check. Problem is, a majority of people don’t carry cash. So, with EVERY person (around 170) I have to say we can only take cash or check. We had a sign on the front door and at all of our registers but most STILL DIDN’T GET THE MESSAGE. We had to constantly deal with people going to the ATM at the store, some people just leaving and not putting back groceries, and quite a few people giving us shit for stuff out of our control. I swear to god, I wanted to tell people to F—K OFF.
It was f— ing aggravating
I said worst day at work
Well, that was one of the worst days of work I’ve ever had...
😑
Well, time to get ready for work. Again...
👌
I also have apple cider. I love apple cider 😃
🍺
😐
Frosted Flakes are nice until they have been sitting in the milk too long; they get soggy and lose their frosting. Then they just become bland corn flakes
What cereal is it?
😐
I already had a sandwich so I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to finish this
It’s REALLY good! 😋
Mmm, apple pie 😃
🎉
I’m done
Well, you can end every sentence with I thought
Well, that is not good. I didn’t really think of it, I thought
Why are we doing this? 😛 T
Well, I don’t know what else to say. What
*insert diss track here*
Walt
WOOOOT
Wot
Have a Good morning sleep
They have 2 cats with plenty of funny/cute moments on the vlog
Here’s funny begging for food 😛 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=enac1-U9xQs
Does she meow when she begs?
This has been a pretty slow morning
Well, as usual, I’m bored
*noms allergies* Let me be near cats dammit
There are some dogs that I’m allergic to also.
We used to have a dog but I’m not sure if she was hypoallergenic or if I got used to her
👍
I wouldn’t mind trying to find a hypoallergenic cat. Except for those hairless ones. Those creep me out
I’m a sucker for dogs. Cats, meh. I’m allergic so I can’t be around them for long
I have never played RollerCoaster Tycoon
Later ninnies. Do well in whatever the hell you guys are doing
Ok, since everyone else is doing other things, I think I’ll go to bed early
Just go to the enemy and beat them. That’s your help
😏
I see Gummy is in vc. I know where I’m avoiding tonight 😛
Sigh
That story was...weird. It’s exactly what I’d expect from Flubs
So he killed himself. The end
Are we near the end?
Let me guess: Flubs killed the detective too
Once upon a time, The End
Here’s my story
Steve from Blue’s Clues?
🤔
Also, FLUBS SAID THINK
How do you go from buying candy to setting a house on fire?
Go to sleep now Gummy
😏
Lol
🤔
“Bed time”...This is coming from the guy who always yells SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK
Ok, what’s happening now?
BE BACK SOON
I’M JUST GOING TO GO WATCH YOUTUBE
I DON’T KNOW WHAT WE’RE YELLING ABOUT
*slow clap*
I’ll take your silence as a yes
...
Is it jelly filled?
*noms something again* I’m hungry
Stop giggle
*noms giggle*
WAS
e!gummy
I’m an introvert, so I understand that
Flubs just does FLHCKIGNITVB
Flubs, if you don’t talk, then how can you sing?
😡
Then I could hear more than terrible singing and screaming
I wish someone else would join in
😑
I want to actually talk to people when I’m in vc
I don’t like it
Recently, every time I go into vc, it’s just me trying to talk, Flubs occasionally providing earrape, and Master singing horribly and screaming
🤔
You never play outside. You need some fresh air
e!gummy-b
One is a main console game. One is a cheap phone app
Oh
What’s nsmb
He wants you to quit so you can spend more time with him 😏
Don’t pull a 2014 SuperSkarmory on us
And will you actually finish them?
Why are you doing this Gummy?
😏
Only in the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
I’m fine. Now, here’s a random thought. It seems like half the time I come back, very few people are actually around. The other half it’s very busy and I have no idea what fresh hell has been unleashed.
How’s everyone doing tonight?
I’M BACK FROM WORK YA NINNIES
Well, make a sandwich later if he’s not around. And that’s it from me. Gotta get ready for work now. See you ninnies later
Just try to cool down for the night
Meh, it’s only 3 hours
‘‘Tis the season of people getting sick
I’ve had a nice, relaxing day myself. Until now since I have to cover someone’s shift at work because she has a stomach virus
Wow...
😐
Skarm give back the cookies
No... 🙄
You don’t like apple pie? 😛
*looks at Flubs*
Better set up some defenses so the ninnies here won’t steal it 😛
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
Too bad I won’t be able to have any until after work
Everything’s homemade 👌
Now THIS is a good looking pie 😃

I’ll just watch tv
Nah. Never heard of it
Ok, 14 minutes until dinner and I have no idea what to do
🎉 or <:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
😐
You can’t go down them properly
Someone who always falls down steps and is angered by 🤔 isn’t that strong
Only someone who needs sleep would say that
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Even after sleeping for a bit, I still feel really tired
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
😒
Idk. It’s your leg
🤔
It was a leg bone
*noms something instead*
Well, I ain’t changing that anytime soon
😐
How do you change that anyways?
It looked awful
It would’ve been better if you said: Chipwrecked. That’s the 3rd movie’s name
...
Sounds like you’re having a good time
Oh hai RC
~~e!flubs: Flubs, you’re a baka~~
I got a couple hours before I have to work tonight. Covering someone who is sick...

Only on the Food Network
Chocolate covered fries smothered in bacon and cheese
Sugar covered-lard fries
If you want to kill yourself while eating, go to the Heart Attack Grill
And their fries are fried in lard, I think
This is from a place called, I kid you not, Heart Attack Grill

You want to be hungry? Or really disgusted?
I just ate so I’m not gonna be hungry 😛
*shrug*
Oh wait, it’s not done
*noms pie before anyone takes it*
Also, you’d be reaching through my phone. I’m using the mobile version of Discord
Buy your own pie
Don’t come any closer
🔪
You guys can’t reach me, so you’ll have to get your own pie 😛
My mom is making an apple pie too 😃
And hungry
Now I’m left more groggy than ever
I tried sleeping for about half an hour
😴
😑
Sigh
😛
So nothing?
Am I addicted to video games or will nothing interest me?
I can spend hours just doing this but anything else, I can’t stay interested for 5 seconds
Why is it 5 seconds after I finish playing video games, I instantly get bored
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
Fulbs is Flubs’ 2nd account
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
😒
Gummy, Gummy, and Gummy?
😐
What makes me feel indifferent: 
Discord
Also add thinking to my happy list
🤔
What makes me angry:
Bad video games 
Children
Work
College 
EVERYTHING ELSE
True
So I’m happy with it again
I’m not playing Overwatch anymore
What makes me happy:
Video games 
YouTube
Not being around people
3 losses in a row. I get the feeling I’m never going to be allowed to win because I’m an abomination who doesn’t deserve to win and be happy
I really hate the elitist people on both sides who hate different opinions
I prefer holding a controller
I don’t play pc. Not comfortable for me
😑
I just want to play with people who know how to actually play the game good
Oh just dandy
😡
NO ONE EVER KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
Well, that’s 2 placement matches lost in a row because EVERYONE ON MY TEAM IS ALWAYS TERRIBLE
Busy
Everyone
Too bad Overwatch is still sucking.
Ok, it’s charging now
Be back later. I need to leave my phone alone
And my phone isn’t charging...
I can’t do anything right at the moment...  and I lost another placement match in Overwatch because someone killed 5 people in a couple seconds
😑
It’s Nerf or nothing
A weapon nonetheless
🔫
There’s no meat cleaver emote
🔪
You do stuff like that with my name all the time. Thought it’d be funny to do the same to you. Apparently not...
Just a joke
😛
*back to Overwatch and the ninnies there*
You like the profile picture? 😛
Oh hai Animal Man
😐
Dragonites are weak to ice, so does that mean you’re weak to yourself?
Lol
I like Froslass
👍
Trying something different for a little bit
There
And his legs worked well too
Again, meh
Meh
🤔
Also, you just woke up at 2pm? I could never do that
Keep it slow
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Ah, I love slow Saturday mornings
Ok, no more Discord for tonight. Later Ninnies
🍔
Little variety in my diet, but I eat a lot of it
I don't know why, but I like watching reviews of fast food and frozen dinners. Probably because I eat so much of both
I'm watching food videos on YouTube
Still more interesting than me
😛
Are you doing something that's actually interesting unlike me?
Probably gonna sleep soon but I'm not sure I'm tired enough yet
Bored
Hai Will
I honestly had thoughts of killing myself back then. I got over it, but I still had thoughts
And looking back, I really hated myself
Well, it feels like I had the least amount of friends to talk to, I had no interest in all of my classes, and I felt more lonely than ever. And I started to go through puberty then, which made it even more awkward
😐
But that's a story no one wants to hear
I really hate just about everything in my life right now. I feel as unhappy as I did in 8th grade, which was my worst year in school
This day felt very weird. I'm left unsatisfied.
Either that or just sleep
I'll just go back to YouTube
Good idea
🤔 Do I dare go back?
Wait, Gummy's in vc now?
Maining Mercy. Which he admits is a bad idea
I'll stick to driving in ovals and circles in NASCAR Heat 2. That's more interesting
Good for you, I guess
It doesn't look interesting to me
I will probably never play Terraria
🤔
Sigh
Flubs, don't main Mercy
Anyways, that was boring.
Stop telling me that.
RC, why you leave? We bore you? Did Master's screaming drive you away? 😛
Brb
Why do I bother talking when Master is doing earrape 24/7?
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
🚪 Here's the door to the therapist. I suggest you go there
🤔
🚪
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
💀
Good night
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
😒
Hang on Flubs. I'm gonna try to do something
Welp, I don't know what to say again. I really am bad at starting conversations
I can't think of anything to say
Don't you love this? Hearing Master cough and also some keyboard noises. 
Sigh,THIS IS STILL BORING.
Then you shouldn't have followed my advice and saved laundry for another night
I'm in vc now. Not sure if this will help our boredom, but whatever
😐
Well, that's all the interesting videos on YouTube I want to watch
Good job 👏
Time for Flubs to roll down the stairs
I think I might go into vc later. I'm getting pretty bored 😛
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
You know what that means!
Really? lol
😏
Uhh, do laundry?
1 second. I need to do something
It can be
🤔
...
I never thought I would get used to that
*regenerates for the 1,000th time*
I like pie
*noms pie*
PIE
Buy a cake then
<:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Oh. Then...
<:FeelsBadMan:327312260970315823>
AHAHA. AHAHA. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IXi0V-s_FqM
I don't do cartwheels
Lol
*cartwheels away*
Well, I'm all alone again
Because I feel like it
*continues to play world's smallest violin*
Is that good or bad?

Ok, for this class, I have to watch these video simulation things and answer questions that go along with them. The acting is just really terrible 😂
😒
See you guys then
I'll just put down my phone for 40 minutes.
No
😐
Ok, I got to focus on getting this online work done. STOP DISTRACTING ME DISCORD
Lol
WEEEEB
I'M AMERICAN BEEF
How I look at everything
😑
Ok, I got to my online class. 😩
8 for me
🌭
😏
Why is my phone working fine yet my computer is so slow?
DAMMIT MY INTERNET IS SLOW. I CAN'T GET TO MY ONLINE CLASS
DAMMIT, I CAN'T ACCESS MY ONLINE CLASS. FUUUUUUUU
😛
I've been around a lot, since I have no social life
Ok, I need to get this homework done
😏
Shoot Flubs. He doesn't need his legs or feet
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
That sucks
*runs to the computer*
Shit, I forgot. I need to do homework due in 3 hours
Friday...
Flubs, you're made of chairs?
*sees new pins*
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
Ok, what's going on now?
Bye Animal Man
Anyways...

Ok, that looks perfect
🎉
I'm still fine for now
A lot of people around here are getting sick
'Tis the season
Oh, I see you have a fever
How is the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells doing?
Hai
Yoy
I'M BACK FROM WORK ONCE AGAIN YA NINNIES
On break for 14 more minutes 🎉
Hi Car Cat
Not sure how much motivation I can put behind it...
I really need to put more effort into studying
😑
Well, that was terrible. I have no confidence in getting a good grade on today's test.
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Whatever. I'm getting off Discord for real now. Good night ninnies
Just kill everything. That's my advice
Lol, what's that?
Oh, you guys are in vc. Do I dare join? 🤔
Probably not
I'll just get off Discord for the night
Oh hai Will
Stop
🔫
*noms song* There, now it's gone
Why you blaming Neko?
No Flubs
Boo
I haven't listened to their other music, just this song
Don't really care about her
I actually like this song
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-KmOd3i7s
Hang on a second. I'll show you a good song from a boy band
No
She's alright
Listen to something other than Taylor Swift
No
*doesn't know what's going on*
Here's a good song https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fM8V1XOI-14
And yes Gummy, that's a country song
There's traditional, pop country, country rock, pop music pretending to be country
It's mostly pop country
I do like some Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, and The Weeknd
😒 Most pop music is either awful or just bland
Hi Neko
*makes Gummy listen to rock music*
😐
I like this new song from Marilyn Manson
I'm listening to Rock music
It doesn't help that there's nothing good to watch on YouTube now and it's really slow here
I'm bored just like every night
I just downloaded it fine
Maybe Taylor is so happy you're getting Mario Run, she has to sing?
Like you?
Of course not many people are around to see it 😛
So we can forever remember this moment 😛

Wow
Then no
😑
Oh, it's free now?
Meh
I never took a science senior year
👌
👍
If I don't oversleep...
I'll look the stuff over again in the morning
I'm done with studying for tonight
I'M TRYING TO STUDY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT
AND A LONG SHIFT AT WORK
I HAVE A TEST TOMORROW
Why is it I always forget material went over in class right after I learn it?
LOOKING OVER THIS MATERIAL ISN'T HELPING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT
I'm not sure if studying will help
Looking at this stuff, I feel like I don't remember any of it 😨
But will I study? Probably, but not for long
I really need to study
And stairs
Now you have to start a new game

I usually wait 2 1/2 hours on Thursday
Too much information
Time for dinner then

I need to stop nomming things. All it does is kill me
What are you tal- 💀
*You didn't* Shut up thoughts. You never help me
Let's see if I actually nommed food this time
*noms something out of boredom*
I guess I don't watch more Twitch streamers because I find streams to be kind of boring. I find myself only staying for short periods of time because I lose interest
I still don't really care about Twitch outside of watching Eyan 😛
Gee, I don't know how he died...

I always say random thoughts here when I'm bored 😑
This was SquidofBaconator's random thought of the day
I really wish I never had to do anything for the rest of my life. Just play video games and watch YouTube for the rest of my life

Well, I don't know anything about League, so...
I have no idea what any of that means 😛
F--- it. *Goes back to NASCAR*
Wanting to kill myself after every match?
That was the worst placement match yet
My team is just awful or the other is the best team ever
The other team is just waltzing right through us
I'm really pissed off now
Oh well. Back to Overwatch and the ninnies there...
...
*noms tired* Dammit, that usually works...
I feel really tired. I think I fell asleep but I'm not sure for how long
Hi folks
Ah, I love not having to sit at college just waiting for bio lab. It's great to be lazy at home
🎉
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
Lol
😏
And now, I must leave for class
That kills 2 birds with one stone
Do it in your sleep 😛
*shoots tranquilizer dart* There, now you can sleep 😛
I woke up with only half an hour before I have to leave for class
You will never get rid of them
🤔🤔🤔
No wonder Flubs hates them so much
That's my thoughts
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
*You can talk to me* Shut up thoughts. You provide nothing to this
I don't want to fall asleep yet, but there's nothing else to do
🤔
Ok, there's nothing on YouTube to watch. So....
I see you guys are busy talking about...something. *goes to YouTube*
I'M BACK FROM WORK YA NINNIES
But for now, I go to work. See you ninnies later. Probably a little less than 5 hours from now
So, I don't have much to look forward to
And Friday, I have a test and a long shift at work
And the Bio lab that I usually have on Thursday isn't happening so I get to go home early. However, I have a lot of homework to do tomorrow
Opposite of me. I have Thursday off and work Friday
I got to work soon
Oh hai Dan
For Flubs, a definite yes
Maybe
Oh. I wonder if seeing Gummy being chased would be funny 😛
Are you being chased by the bulls?
I do. I need energy to laze around
😨
I like having dinner 4:30-5
What?
We're having chicken 🍔
Anyways, dinner time.
🤔+stairs= <:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009> It's legit
I love thinkingstairs 😛
🍾 Can't forget the Mountain Dew
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to nom some popcorn 🍪
Get your food right
No, this is 🍩
😐
I don't like tea
TM
Just another day in the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Thinking and Losing Brain Cells
I nommed a knife and now I'm dead
What are you talk- Hey, why is there blood coming out o- 💀
*noms something* I believe I nommed food
Hmm. I'm still hungry
🤔
What? I saved you some
Thanks for the pie. I saved you a slice
*noms pie*
Well, I ran out of things to do
👌
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
I think I found your worst fear
I believe it's been established that it doesn't like you
🤔
How has the world been treating Flubs?
I got my homework done quickly, recorded stuff for my first collaboration with another YouTuber, and I have been able to relax. If I didn't have to work tonight, this day would've been near perfect
🎉
Anyways, today has been good so far
I'm a Baconator and I smell good
Why henlo
😐
Oh hai Flubs
🍔
😛
Glad I don't have to be outside or this Baconator would start baking
It's 90 here
I do have work tonight
Also, ~~e!gummy-c: Go to class, Gummy~~
Good, you're playing outside
And it's just me and my thoughts *That's a good thing, right SquidofBaconator?* 
No, it's not
And now, it's back to playing with the Overwatch Ninnies
I'm feeling good
Ok, I just recorded my first collaboration with another YouTuber 😃
I have more important things to do.
*Just goes back to video games*
Well, this paper probably sucks, but I don't care 😑
~~kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Thinking and Losing Brain Cells~~
🤔
I'm so glad Master made that emote 😛
<:ThinkingSteps:362415283488555009>
😏
This Biology class is boring and the professor isn't good at explaining
I got nothing out of it
No
A short paper. Pretty much, we got into groups to discuss a couple articles and we were each assigned a different one. We went over them and discussed our opinions on those topics. The paper is pretty much just summarizing everyone's opinions in the group. Kind of stupid if you ask me
Even though this shouldn't take long, it does because I only come up with a couple sentences per several minutes 😛
👍
Ah, don't you love procrastination? Pushing everything off until the last minute until you have to do it and it makes you feel stressed? Good times...
👍
Work work work work work
School work, not job work
Well, time to get to work
Well, today's going to be a long day. I have to finish work for college due tomorrow, possibly record my first collaboration with another YouTuber, and do it before I go to work tonight. And now, it's time for class. Definitely one of the busiest days for me
I'm going to bed too
No
*heads out for a second* brb
👻
My head better stop hurting when I wake up tomorrow
I have nothing to say 😐

RC, want to join in?
Flubs tried earrape again
I'm talking 😏
Join VC?
...
Anyone else want to join in on this?
But I think I'll take out my headphones. Just in case 😒
Meh maybe
You mean, I talk and you kill my hearing?
Well, it's another boring night for me...
🤔
Take a chill pill

🤔
Oh, that's the lyrics
What does that have to do with anything
~~e!flubs-c: Like SquidofBaconator's music, Flubs~~
You just don't like any of my music
Which means it's happy
This has happy in the title
Flubs, you need a happy song https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GBRAnuT48qo
Skarm still makes no sense
8 to be exact 😛
I haven't said one in several minutes 😐
😐
e!gummy-b
I don't even have my 1st video; I deleted it
First video
~~e!stuck: Be quiet Stuck~~
We have Gummy calling himself a baka. He finally admitted it

Maybe
I believe so
e!gummy
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Flubs, whenever I go to bed, you say "SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK"
Night Animal Man
I ain't doing no Engrish essay
Boo essays
My head hurts
No, we're the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
*noms this dumb conversation*
*noms somewhere*
😑
I can't see you or where you are pointing
Where is somewhere?
And I'm in somewhere
Soooubway?

Why do I keep nomming your cane? It's bland...
Again?
*noms something random* Ok, what did I get today?
Why not?

That was good pie. Thank you Flubs 😃

1 minute please
Ninnies...
😐
How, I have no damn clue
We...somehow won that round
Ninnies...
No
Well, I suck...
And it's about to start. I will be back with further updates on the ninnies and my progress
No. Only in my 2nd placement match
"YOU F---ING NINNIES CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT"
*back to Overwatch competitive*
Wait, I might be remembering things wrong IDK 😐
I thought that was my 1st
I can't remember 😐
Was that the 1st or 2nd time I talked here?
I don't think I have actually been in a vc since I first talked here
In real life, I trust almost no one
I really do have trust issues
No.
*back to video games*
🤔
I want anything other than Flubs earrape
😐
Seriously though, if anyone wants to join vc later, I'm all for it. Except for Flubs; he's a <:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
Flubs, you will add nothing to it other than micspamming and earrape
I'm gonna take the silence as a no
Unless someone other than Flubs (who just wants to micspam) wants to join
No
🤔
Well, too bad
Lol
My phone was acting weird. I had to turn it off and back on again
The split between main and special channels before
For example, I don't recall

Just slight changes in design
At least for me
Ok, Discord looks a little different on mobile now...
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
?
🎉
No
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Guys, should I change my profile pic to one of these faces?
*grabs cane* Oh wait, that's Flubs' thing
*grabs popcorn*
😏
👂
No leg emote
:leg:
🔫
Please stop that. Both of you. It's not funny
Stuck and on the floor
Now you're just like Flubs
😂
🤔
Be a Baconator like me
Dan, go back to the cat lizard
You're a board?
Animal Man, why do you keep saying that?
💀
Buy more
Tuesday
Sigh
You might need to buy some more
What is that?
Did you check under the bed?
No
😐
No eggplants
Have a cookie 🍪
Good job Chewy
BUT YOU SAID THINK
🤔
It's been 150
*noms flamethrower* I can breathe fire now
Cat? 😏
💀
I'm allergic to cats
I like dogs better
*NOMS SOMETHING*
Yeah, I remember that
*noms ice cream*
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
MEH
😐
CAPS LOCK FTW
I should do a paper due Thursday and I won't have much time to do it tomorrow, but I don't feel like it
Hi Chewy
What's going on?
That's kind of sad
😨
There's a last time for everything
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LWkoquUvD98
There's a song for everything
Flubs, you need to walk https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFqg5wAuFk
Walk
😛
My life is like a joke-stupid and pointless
Do people play a lot of jokes on you that day then?
APRIL FOOLS
My head hurts
"Birds and the bees" 😏
Is talk of suicide allowed here?
Do your legs kind of work still?
Months are like my life-stupid
😐
🤔
Oh hai Dan
Upload everything Gummy. So everyone has a good laugh 😉
I'M BACK FROM WORK EXHAUSTED YA NINNIES
😑
Well, that's it from me. Time for work 🎉
😛
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rAlTOfl9F2w
Blargh, what?
👋
Got done with my test early so I now have half an hour to relax before going to work 😃
😭
Well, time to leave the house and not come back for 9 hours
And I'm going to bed. Night, you ninnies
e!gummy-b
Oh god, don't start this up again
👍
Oh right, you live in the town that hates the handicapped
Do you like looking old?
Well, if you get a wig, then you can dry it
😐
Dry it
Anyways, I'm just watching South Park now
It requires you to THINK
🤔
Since Flubs didn't do it, I did
...
Oh
Welp, guess it's just me and my thoughts again
Can someone tell me?
I can't tell on mobile
Why do people keep 🎉 everything negative that I say? Is it Flubs?
Ok, I did something I guess. Now I'm bored again
Well, back to me and my thoughts *Like always SquidofBaconator*
😐
Anyone else?
Maybe
You know, I've been thinking: what would a SquidofBaconator command be?
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
~~e!master: Do your homework, Master~~
How about...The Ninny
Call yourself... ~~SuperGummying~~
I need stupid shit like this to relax and try to not think about life so much
😒
I'm not joking. I haven't been this stressed out in a long time
I'm not sure how I'm surviving 😨
Starting tomorrow, I'm not going to have time to do anything Because my job takes up half of my day for 3 days this week
And I'm going to.... try and figure out what I want to do
Lol
Sarcasm
*I'm going to another country*
🤔
Sigh
RC, I'll join if you do. Just keep your headphones out of your ears 😛
🤔
👂
I'm not sure if I feel like joining
😑
"Later" when I'm asleep
Only one way to find out
You don't talk. You just make noises that are earrape
I'm talking about when multiple people are in it
I'm always asleep by then
I'm never around when everyone's in it
I only think I actually talked in voice channel once
I only spend money on video games and food
I'm employed. I'm just a cheapskate
Also, I haven't been in a voice channel in a while
Same here RC
And Gummy: Do better in English
Oh hello Neko
No
Well, I'm bored
SCREEEEEEAAAAAM
Lol
People here are either very nice or just awful
America is already stupid
We don't need his influence to spread to our nation's youth
Oh. Well then, keep him out of the states
John Green can go outside with him
e!gummy-b
Sigh, Gummy's influence is spreading to the youth. Hide your children before it's too late
Kids are the worst
In NASCAR, they stick to more left turns

Big macaroni makes big cookies 🤔
There, everyone throws all items at me at once

This is what we call cancer

The diss tracks?

Oh wait, no one who makes diss tracks can
I can't rap
To get views easy
1) I'm playing Nascar
2) I'm not making any more TTG videos

Speaking of ninnies
:magnet:
Oh, night Ida
I swear to god, these ninnies hacked there way to Level 25
Well, I lost the first placement match 😭
I lost 😑
Am I still 9th?
Most of the Earthbound only talk once or twice
1st time in Competitive
I'm Bastion
Competitive
I'm not mercy
Overwatch
This match is crazy 😐
Yep. Ninnies
💀
Here we go. First competitive match
Here 🏈 Play with this Gummy
No Gummy
💀
Nothing can stop you. Diamond and Pearl. Pokemon
New rivals. As you fight for survival
It's all about the challenges. It's a brand new game. It's a brand new world
Ok, time for Overwatch competitive play. Hope it doesn't want to make me cause pain to everyone on my team
😏
🤔
I've sent 8,814
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
<@!178655272796028928> So, you're siding with Flubs now? 😛
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
🤔
Seriously, I think I'll see how I do on this exam and see if I need to change my habits and if I WANT to change then
Ok, I'm not studying. *Goes to play more video games* Yeah, I'm not addicted
Honestly, I might be addicted 😛
Yep 🎮
So, there's an event at the college for a talk on video game addiction. That's totally not for me *Stops studying to go play Overwatch*
So, I think I'll study. I SHOULD for the rest of the night but it's probably going to just be 10 minutes
😛
*hugs also also*
Lol
🎉
My Switch is like my life-A waste of time
This phone is like my life- a waste of time
Know any good analogies?
I needed to shave 2 days ago

Don't trust him
The cake is a lie
Good. Go play outside
*noms data* Wait, that doesn't help...
Sigh
It tastes like 💩
😑
💩
I have to do something that can only be done on the computers there, yet I have literally no time to do it
Boring
Not really enjoying it
Statistics: I'm taking that class
~~e!Flubs-t: Stop think~~

Stick? What stick?
*noms soccer/basketball*

🏀 Here, go play with this
That'll be more productive

Always on my team...
People in Overwatch still suck...
Alright until I have to study
Hai again Chewy
Yep

🤔 THOUGHTS?!
Almost at level 25
I don't know 😑
Yes?
No?
Maybe?
To Overwatch I go?
So...
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Huzzah
🎉
Yeah, it's no fun without Flubs
You remember what it was?
🤔
I spent 3 hours getting a video edited while also chatting here
I was about to play Overwatch earlier, but I had to stop immediately because dinner
How have you guys been?
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
Animal Man!
👍
You're a moose, yet you have a profile pic of a cow 😛 And yes, it's been around for a few months
I beat Draco to it 😛
Greetings and Salutations. Welcome to Zeal, Needlemoose
Hai Kugal
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
So, 99% of Overwatch players suck?
🤔
Hooray 😑
I've heard the console players are the worst
I'm almost at level 25, to compete with the terrible ninnies in competitive
*back to Overwatch, even though I haven't played it yet today*
Wait, what's ddos? I think I've heard of it
🎉
Oh hai Flubs and Wolverale and Chewy
👍
Anyone who needs confidence 😛
I can post more stick figure art if that makes you more confident in your drawing ability 😛
Out of an 11 minute 42 second video
I have 1 1/2 minutes to go
Oh hai Will. I'm not really doing artsy stuff, unless video editing counts
I shouldn't have to work almost as much as a full time employee when I'm in college. It really pisses me off that no one does anything about these problems. And we hire too many high school kids. And they wonder why they have trouble getting people to work certain times...
And you expect me to come to work tonight, miss out on being able to study for a test, and get even less time to relax? Yeeeah, f--k off. They need to hire one or two more people...
😭
So, once I leave home at 8, I won't be getting home until after 5
And work literally right afterwards
I do have a test tomorrow
I don't have to work today. Although, one person asked me today if I could work later, but I rejected saying I need to study for a test tomorrow
Hi Dan
~~e!gummy-c: Go to class Gummy~~
It feels like I literally shouldn't be doing anything else
Tests and my job take up too much time
Well, I really need to finish editing my video today. If I don't, I never will
Got to go
👍
"Pink smurph" So, did one smurf change their skin color? 😛
Class starts in 2 minutes. Feels like I'm always here right before class to waste a couple minutes
Morning
In class. Bored 😛
Ok, good night Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
Well, time for bed. Unless something comes up in the next 5 seconds that continues to distract me
Into insanity
As long as I don't go too far
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Oh god, I think I'm getting close to peak insanity
*But you always talk to me* Because I can't get rid of you!
*Do you want to talk to me SquidofBaconator* Quiet, you stupid thoughts.
And now the chat has slowed down
And that's how I spent enough time on here to get to #9
I need this time to just dick around and play video games or I would go insane
Not really
Wait, what?
MY LIFE F---ING HATES ME
Again...
Oh, and finish editing a video and do that collaboration
I have so much work to do:
Study for 2 tests
Do online classwork
Write a short paper 
Do all of this while working 16 hours at my job
Because MY LIFE F---ING HATES ME
Tuesday, I have to take the test and literally right afterwards, I have to go to work until 5
So don't distract me tomorrow night 😛
I'm not going to bother studying until tomorrow night
None of you probably know him 😛
With this guy: https://m.youtube.com/user/csandreas
On the brighter side, I believe I'll be doing my 1st collaboration with another YouTuber soon 👍
I have no life outside of college and work. I don't have the time to do much of anything and it's REALLY stressing me out 😨
Idk
🤔
You have to have very little social life or be a spammer like Gummy 😛
17 levels to go 😑
I'll never get into the top 5 though 😛
I'm closing in on passing Will
I should be studying.
Or video editing.

I hate hip hop

We usually get a good amount of snow
Do you like it there?

It's going to be 90 again tomorrow
How's the weather? 
*why do I always resort to that...*
So...
He's too busy playing with himself 2: electric boogaloo
It just isn't the same without Flubs rolling in to yell "STOP THINK"
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
Never played it afterwards
I played it for a month
Don't lump me with Gummy
Minecraft is kind of boring
Is he fighting Gummy again?
Second
Yeah, maybe 1
He just beat Gummy in a fight. Give him 5
🤔
*rolls back to YouTube*
Gummy lost already. Not surprising...
No, this is perfect
🎉
No, you're fighting
e!gummy-b
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
Take medicine
ONLY IN THE KINGDOM OF INTROVERTED NINNIES LOSING BRAIN CELLS!!

Yep
I just have my thoughts *Hey, I'm good*
I don't even talk to the bot
👍
I'm always dead inside when I see people
🤔
So...Ayana is a tsundere confirmed?
Ayana hates Dan...
Lol
*rolls to YouTube*

*rolls away from nothing*
😐
I'm back from work ya ninnies
I...I don't even want to know
And I just tried a pumpkin spice 🥞
I'm here. 5 hours later 😛
🤔
Ok, how much should the bounty on Flubs be?
💀
*eats 🍔 in my bed*
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
I need this for my other food
*takes out a fork*
*noms popcorn*
Oh, here we go!
Wait, that's it? Well, I got popcorn for nothing
*passes 🍿 to Animal Man*
Hey Animal Man, you want popcorn too? 😛
*grabs 🍿 This will be interesting*
I'm staying right here doing nothing
<@!239928598696427520> You hearing this?

Of course the sun isn't out
It's night now
It's going to be 90 here Monday 😩
So, how about that weather?

He's serious you ninny bot
Stop singing
You ruined it ^ <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Nay ^
Yeah ^
Quiet you
I see you know who still hates :pondering:
🤔

Don't do that. Here, calm down and have a cookie or something
*noms life*
<:HelloThere:305560404715896832>
"Yeah, we were gonna hire you, but we found out you're yelling at a camera about some stupid show for children, so we don't want YOUR KIND here."
I do worry about that with my YouTube channel. Not sure employers want someone who talks about kids cartoons and country music seriously 😛
But, if it went viral, it might affect my employment situation, so no
It might get some entertainment 😏
I think it is. At least, when I get to competitive play, I will 😛
I have issues, I'll admit it
Yeah...
I have a terrible time controlling my anger in video games. My primal Baconator comes out then. I did throw my Xbox controller across the room once
When I was younger, when I was having a terrible time playing Pokemon, I smashed my DS on the floor so hard, I broke it
Here's a story
Yep
Let's see, I get most angry during a really bad session of playing video games
No
Anyways, you REALLY don't want to see me angry. TRUST ME <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
👋
😛
My voice is either "I don't care about anything" or "I WILL SNAP YOUR F---ING NECK"
I either sound bored or angry
I can keep my voice sounding the same. I have a very hard time changing the sound of my voice
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
If you've heard my voice, you'll know why
Occasionally, I try to sing horribly 😛
I listen to music loud in the car
I've never been to any type of concert. Most of them, you probably want to bring earplugs
💀
Where are u at?
Every time I come back, I'm always lost 😛
Wait, what?
And bored. Very bored...
Yep, still crazy...
*You should just talk to me SquidofBaconator* Hey, I need more than my thoughts to talk to
Well, I'm still terrible at starting conversations 😛
So...how's the weather?
Lbl
Lal
Lil
Lul
🤔
Great....
😐
I swear to god, every time I come back here today, Gummy says something weird or stupid...
e!gummy
Sigh
You see? Both Flubs and Gummy are acting dumb...
I'm not surprised. It's more annoyance at this point. "😑 They're acting stupid again..."
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
I go to record audio for 5 minutes...
At least I'm doing something productive...
I'm going back to working a little more on my video
Meh
So go get some ☀
Doesn't sound like you're learning
e!gummy-b
I can't remember. Why did he do that?
One thing that always bugged me when I was younger was that Eyan never did the post game in Pokémon games 😛
Mainly because I wanted to watch something from Eyan and I was starting to get annoyed with the start-stop pattern of the channel. I believe I still have a comment saying something along those lines on Episode 10 of Sun and Moon
I ended up getting curious about Twitch in April or May or something
I started looking back into him when he started Sun and Moon
I knew he was just doing Twitch, but 2015-2016, I didn't care too much
Most fans only care about a YouTube and nothing else
A majority of fans don't care to look into it
Go to sleep
I think he was more curious in the why, not the how
I don't think that's it
😒
That was pointless
He's more of a Twitch streamer nowadays
I don't really like it, but I'm aware that he has reasons which I'm sure a lot of fans don't know of
😐
I'm a Squid Baconator. I'm well aware of my dumb name
I blame our stupid names
I doubt we'll get an answer
Welcome FireIce38
Video talking about my first impressions on 2 shows: one good and one bad
Meh, I'll finish the video Monday...
Don't mind me, I'm just losing my mind again...
*Sounds tedious SquidofBaconator* It is...
And now, I'm tired 😴
If I didn't get distracted earlier, I would probably be done recording now...
I'm still making this video. I got a good chunk of the audio recorded, but I still need to do a little more before I can put all of my focus on editing
🤔
Then why are you playing it?
Don't procrastinate
I got most of the audio recorded, just a couple more parts before I only have to edit everything
*still working on a video*
😛
Weird. He was playing "With himself 2: electric boogaloo"
Gummy has drugs confirmed?
Canadians have football. I think...
*throws football* Go play with it
It's decided: go play outside
4 <:Yea:327308337722949642> And one no
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
e!gummy-b
Good
Oh hai

A competitive eater could
That could kill you 😛

It's cake?
Quiet you

Wait, I didn't want that. I was aiming for the 🥞
*noms whatever I want*
I will nom whatever I want
Dammit... *noms Moon*
That means it's bed time
Look, the moon's out
🌙
SLEEP
Well, I'm finally working on the video I haven't done much on in weeks and procrastinated until now. I finally actually have time to do so...
🤔
Good. You need sleep
Some matches are just pointless. I was the only one who was able to even get to the objective
As always, I'm put on the team in Overwatch that doesn't know how to kill people...
There, now you must sleep
*shoots tranquilizer dart at Flubs*
🎯
~~e!flubs: go to sleep Flubs~~
Sigh
I'm awake. Flubs, you better be asleep now
Yeah, that doesn't look fun...
What do you need?
Be there in a minute
<:KingofChamp:335544767616385025>
So, Eyan's streaming?
I'M BACK FROM WORK YA NINNIES
Well, that's it from me. See all you ninnies after work
*gives coffee to Dan*
I'll try to make it to the stream if he does one
I have to go to work in 4 minutes...
🎉
😒
😭
I have to go to work in 20 minutes
Welp, I won't even be able to find 100, let alone 900...
900? Why are there so many...
Bye Kugal
💀
847?!!
I still haven't done that 😐
Oh hai

*takes the 20 🦌*
Pfffffft lul

*noms toxic fan base* Did that help?
Probably when we allow 5 year olds to play games meant for teens/adults...
Why does every single multiplayer game have toxic fan bases...
Lol
🔥

*noms Overwatch*
Oh wait, I have the digital version

Oh god...
Is that bad? 😛
🤔
Level 24 now
I'm actually playing Overwatch now 😐
*goes to do something else*
How can you down vote Eyan?
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY
😃
😛
🤔
He's level 49
You still have a ways to go
If Gummy doesn't say anything and Flubs spams a lot...

Baconator, not egg

Is henlo the new saying here?
😏
Gummy needs you
Well, I have 2 things I need to do before work:
Finish online classwork 
Work more on a video that I haven't done much in in weeks
😏
🥞
Syrup? PANCAKES?!
🤔
4-6 PM? Hopefully, I'm not always working at those times.
*walks away slowly*
I'm already in it
Ok, you go have fun. I'm going to bed
🎉
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>

And I'm not dead
Ok, I think I got my Switch back

Wait, where did my Switch go? 😨
What did I nom?
*noms something instead*
*noms cane* Do it now
So, Stuck's weakness are:

Walking

Hmm, thinking isn't provoking a strong reaction from Flubs. How peculiar...

Console peasant here
Oh. I never played League 😛
Never played it
Don't mind me, this is becoming normal...
And I'm still descending into madness
*I watch it SquidofBaconator* Good, someone else does
F---ing hilarious
It's my favorite show
I'll take the silence as a no
...
Anyone else watch it?
Nothing like eating snacks and watching Impractical Jokers
<:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
Bob Ross? 😛
Found something. *noms Little Debbie snack*
Perfect
He's too busy training Gummy to even bother
Lol

I didn't eat much of my bad dinner
I do know that I'm hungry now.
I never know exactly how I feel
Ok, I guess

He's going hunting; hence the gun
🔫 take this
FREEZER
Well, that was a pain in the f---ing ass
As in, right now brb
I have to help move a freezer later. Can't remember why they wanted to move it, but whatever
^
Do you expect anything different?
~~e!flubs~~
Now, can we move onto something more important?
Thank you, whoever removed that
😑
Then the ice is done. Wait, is it frozen? F--- me
Gordon Ramsay: Today, we're going to be making ice. First, put olive oil into the pan

Hang on a second
To put it simply, I like potatoes in almost every form
Oh, and hash browns and home fries are nice too
🤔
One restaurant I like has this baked potato soup with big chunks of potatoes in it 👍
I like those too
Loaded baked potatoes too
French fries, potato wedges, and tater tots are also great
Baked potato soup is great
There was chicken with a bad seasoning on it and without it, it was bland and chewy. And salt potatoes; my least favorite form of the potato
Well, dinner was very disappointing
Xteen dollars
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
Again
Yes
🤔
Anyways.... *insert something funny here*
Oh, it's from Harry Potter
"Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder"... 🤔
Bio lab is always a pain in the ass. The professor never explains things well and no one ever knows what to do
I'm home from class, ninnies
I'll see you ninnies later
Well, time for bio lab. FINALLY
Sigh
Pffffffffffft

Suddenly, Flubs
😏
I actually really like Waluigi
WAHHHHLUIGI
😐
*noms class* There, I don't have to go to class anymore

Wahhhluigi

Ok, it's starting to get hot out here. If only a breeze was blowing
:wondering:
🤔
😒
Well, I ran out of things to say

Lol
And I only have 14 minutes. Not that much time left
That pun was bad and you should feel bad for making it
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
I just realized: I've been on Discord/YouTube this whole time. I haven't touched my Switch
Yeah
I'm going to guess level ups will always be public from now on 😛
🎉
70 degrees: Perfect temperature
Wish I brought my sunglasses 😎
<:FeelsAmazingMan:305797461903933442>
It's bright and sunny now
You know, every day I had lab so far, it rained
20 more minutes...
It's pretty nice out here
Skarm: Go play outside Squid
Until I go to lab
I think I'll go outside for a half hour
It's either mmmmhmhmhm or HI EVERYONE HOW ARE YOU?!!!
They turned up the volume too loud...
No wait, she's a poet
And now, I think someone is about to sing
I don't feel like burping
Well, NOW I feel full 😑
People are reading poems for some reason
🍕
Meh, I still got some
I think Cheese or pepperoni
They're giving out free pizza but I'm not hungry 😐
I'm watching YouTube

I'm on a comfortable couch and slightly tired
No
I feel like I could fall asleep here

🤔
"30 scoops of ice cream and 17 toppings" that isn't too much?
<@!239928598696427520> If you think there's no such thing as overeating, then you haven't seen this guy

I'm reminded of Matt Stonie; competitive eater whom I'm subscribed to on YouTube
I'm not a competitive eater
I think I had just enough food before it went to overeating
Well, I'm full 😑
I'm gonna finish this food before it gets cold
Hi Neko
I'm surprised Skarm hasn't stolen a sandwich in a while
🍔
Look at all this unhealthy food. I should be fat 😛
I'M LAZY
Must be metabolism
How I'm not fat, I have no idea
I'm lazy and I'm here, eating a burger, fries, slice of pizza, and a cookie
Of a person/Baconator
I'm a twig
*noms backflip*
Well, that didn't work
*Attempts to flip Flubs*
Unless you say "I can't backflip"
"Backflips" and Flubs don't belong in the same sentence
👍
Well, you can think of what you did wrong until I get back 😛
🤔
Anyways, time for lunch. FINALLY
Oh, high school. There is so many things wrong with you...
Thinking about 12th grade, I think it would've been possible to switch my lunch and study hall because I had study hall afterwards and I'm pretty sure some friends were in the later lunch
I was in 2 groups: the smart people and the gamers
And it's not like you can go anywhere
9th and 11th grade were fine; I had friends in those lunch periods. 10th and 12th, not so much
Now at college, I don't care as much but it still bugs me
I always hated that
I think that stems from high school when you never want to sit alone
Even then, I would just go through a drive thru because I don't like eating in a restaurant by myself
I could go somewhere else to eat, but I don't feel like leaving the campus
Just waiting for the dining hall to open for lunch
I'm just going back and forth from here and YouTube
Ok then.
Lol
If you ever need help with stick figure art, I can help 😛
Sounds tedious
And looking at my profile picture isn't helping my hunger condition
Doesn't look like anything I could do
Random thought: man, I'm starving. I still have to wait 20 minutes until lunch... 
And that looks pretty challenging
Oh, art stuff. I ain't good at that
What does that mean?
And you?
Except lunch, playing video games, and going on the internet
Ok. I have almost nothing to do for 2 1/2 hours
Hello
I'm out of class now. And so, the 2 1/2 hour wait for bio lab begins now 😐
Ok, I need to finish this video in 10 minutes, so no more Discord for the night. Later Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells

🍔
Stealing food ya bot
Good, Skarm didn't steal it
*hands Neko a sandwich*
:wondering:
We're thinking of synonyms for thinking
Hi Neko
❓
THINK?!
🤔
Wut
*Goes back to watching YouTube and questioning Stuck's sanity*
Exactly
NEEEERD
Do something more productive
This is getting old
*regenerates*
*noms cheesecake anyways*
So, the only thing I see interesting on YouTube is the Nostalgia Critic reviewed A Goofy Movie today
Idk
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
🤔
I'm glad, I guess...
Well, time to watch YouTube then pass out so I don't wake up late like this morning
Boring as f---
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I'M BACK FROM WORK YA NINNIES
😭
Ok, time to get ready for work
That didn't help...
*noms boredom*
I'm bored because I ran out of things to do to waste time before work
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Back to me and my thoughts I go...
*Gee SquidofBaconator, are you ever happy?* I never know...
I always have something to complain about
But I'm bored right now...
Ok, 20 minutes until I leave for work. As always, I don't want to go...
I know 😛
😏
⚔️
rip
💀
WHY IS THIS ITEM SO EXPENSIVE?!
That's how it's always been...
LET ME SEE YOUR MANAGER!
That won't change anything but whatever...
Not exactly how it went, but roughly what I've been through
I know; I've seen it
Occasionally, it can be justifiable. Most of the time, it's used by idiots/assholes who know that the manager will side with them
I'm pretty sure every employee hates the "Let me see your manager" person
😐
Why'd he ask you to leave?
"Why did they let you out in the open?" I bet some asshole would say that
I wonder what people would say to you if you were a Walmart greeter?
You seem to have it worse off than me 😛 At least the kid was nice
One guy got mad yesterday because some bread was "buy one get one free" and you have to buy one regular price and he only had one. 😑
Some people are just mean
You should've hit her with your cane
Subway folk?
Do people really hate the disabled there?
Probably because we're Introverted Ninnies who don't want to interact with people irl
*Questions why I'm still here...*
😒
I'm a Baconator. No hands
Scream at something else
What did I do to you...
😏
What...
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
Set an alarm
Which translates to: 1 hour until I go to hell...
🎉 1 hour until I go to work...
😐
Lol
:thinkng:
Lol
I just said the definition of Baka
Not in our world
😑
"Idiot" and "Divine Leader" are nowhere close
Idk
Baka...
I don't really care...
*yawn*

🤔
*takes Stuck's cane*
*Rises from the dead*
Don't take my money 🔫
💀
Too late.
*noms 🍔*

I'm never gonna get it
Never played it

🤔
Or 🔫
I use a golf club
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Oh, that's what I nommed?
*noms something again* I gotta stop doing that when I'm bored...
I may not overuse my phone, but I'm probably addicted to video games 😛
Why his wheel?
I'm pretty sure people have done that for years now
I didn't get one until high school
That's too young
In this day and age, even 7 year olds have one
I just don't take selfies
Everything that's put on a phone is downgraded in some way
I see Flubs probably disliked that. Can't tell on mobile
🤔
At least, what normal people like
All trends are bad
Diss tracks?
That's how many people find him "awesome"
See the sub and view count

He ate 113 pancakes in 8 minutes before
He did this and I still have no idea how competitive eaters do this 😛
*Insert generic kids in Africa could eat that comment*
This is double that

Nope 😛
This is making me hungry

*Last message: 1 hour ago* Ok, that's a decent amount of time
It doesn't feel like I was gone for long 😛
Hi Kugal
Now, to try and sleep because I never have enough of it...
It involves both of those with me
I could just sleep, even though I got almost 9 hours of sleep last night, it feels like I need more 😑
Which is why I'm on here <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I'm glad I have time to relax, but I end up getting bored half the time 😛
Anyways, yeah, Kingdom Hearts always looked kind of overrated in my eyes. Then again, I never played one of them, so what do I know?
God, why am I on a losing team the majority of the time...
Well, my Overwatch team still sucks...
Honestly, Kingdom Hearts looks very overrated to me
I never played Kingdom Hearts. And only 2016 Ratchet
I spent hundreds on Nintendo this year
😂
I never played a Xenoblade game
🤔
And we lost badly...
We barely moved the payload
Oh great, the other team is insanely better than us...
"Junkertown"
Hey, there's a new map in Overwatch 😃
🎉
Good for you, I guess 😛
*Sees pins* So, JonTron is at the top eh? 😛
I did all my work for today. Now I can relax until 6, when I go to work
To the point where I didn't want to drive 😐
Honestly, I was really nervous when I first started driving.
🎉
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ifaoKZfQpdA
I'm stupid when it comes to this technical stuff
I still don't know what that is 😛
I have no idea what that is 😛
"Hello, my name's NINOOOO"
Recently, I have been watching episodes of Kitchen Nightmares while eating lunch 😛
Introverted NINNIES Losing Brain Cells 😛
Lol
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
The meatballs took a while to heat up 😛
🤔
Eating meatballs
I took regular Calculus instead of AP Calculus in high school. It was pretty easy. At least, the teacher made it easy
Well, time for class 😑
I didn't have time to eat breakfast so I'll have to settle with a snack I have
I get the feeling that today isn't going to be good if that's a sign of things to come
I made it with 2 minutes to spare
I'm here
Well, shit. I woke up late and I only have 15 minutes until I have to go 😑
Ok, time to catch up on YouTube
The thing closest to a skill in me is being lazy
Same here Flubs
🎉
I like saying wait
Wait
Wait
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I'm even more lonely. This is my only time where I interact with people outside of college and my job
That's nothing new
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
ANNOUNCEMENT: TNEMECNUONNA

ANNOUNCEMENT: I like food
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
Calm down Flubs. You're not a dog
🤔
🤔🤔 <:Thinking:325447327940870145>
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
JonTron is better. Even though I've only watched a handful of his videos 😛
That's fine
Because TTG
<:Treason:305563730056314880>
<@!218843275824463872> 😨
*noms AHHHHHHHHHHHHH*
I have no idea what's wrong with 9/19
🤔
😒
And Flubs is screaming again...
I'm glad it actually got removed 😛
😛
~~Well, 1st graders, do you want to lose your childhood innocence?~~
No
😏
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
😒
I'm just a Baconator 😛
And I'm not an Enlightened individual
Anyone actually around? 😛
I'M BACK YA NINNIES
Ok, bye
WHAT A COINCIDENCE
Well, time to go to work 😭
🤔
~~donate your money to me?~~
~~get me out of my job~~
😛
A company that makes people stop being ninnies in Overwatch?
🤔
A company that....
If I won the lottery right now, I'd quit my job, drop out of college, and move somewhere nicer to live
If only that actually happened...
Tempting.
Anyone have a good excuse to not go to work?
Anyways, I have 10 minutes until I go to work 😭
I'm Baconator type; the secret 19th Pokemon type
And no, I was just saying once he becomes sentient, the robots will try to take over
Hey, there's the quote I suggested 😛
Quiet you
I still think Skarm will become sentient and revolt one day
👍
Good, Skarm didn't steal it
Maybe a sandwich
Anyways, I should eat something before I go to work
Well, there are parts of me that I do hate 😛
🤔
*plays inspirational music*
<:Nay:327308337706434570> I hate hairless cats
🤔
If I'm secretly a cat, does that mean I'm allergic to myself?
I'm allergic to cats
I'm not a cat. Or an anime girl. I don't like being patted on the head
😑
Meh. I have to work later. Again. 3rd out of 4 days in a row
Hi Kugal
Ok, screw sleep
Great, I want to sleep a little before work, yet I can't fall asleep 😑
Fine
Hi Will
Speaking of Overwatch, I'm at level 23 now. 2 levels away from playing with the ninnies in competitive
I don't have homework due until Thursday
That sucks
But for now, Overwatch time
See if that helps me or makes me even more tired
I really should sleep a little before work
Well, that was my message of the morning. Time for class 😑
Ida has a server? 🎉 or <:Nay:327308337706434570>
Welcome Pasha. The people here have some really colorful names...
Ok, I'm going to sleep for real now.
🥊
Of course Skarm said something about Gummy
🔫 PLAY OUTSIDE
As for me, it's time to pass out and sleep again. Any last words?
e!gummy-b
Someone needs to make an emote of that 😛
:thinkingstairs:
So, which of these causes more damage to Flubs: stairs or 🤔
🤔
I'm a Baconator. I'm already made of dead animals
*noms heater* Now you're cold
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
I leave for 5 seconds and I'm already lost again...
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
You obviously needed an English lesson
Only in the Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
^
Gummy, why are you always responding to things that happened a while ago?
*noms Brain damage* Ok, I'm better now
Whho brneed mi braaain?
Back to my thoughts...
*That sucks SquidofBaconator* I know man...
...
Anyways, it feels like I have barely any time to relax anymore with how much I work on top of college
Frustration eating isn't good for you
🤔
It's not time to stop
No, Filthy Frank
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
Well, time to catch up on YouTube
...
*noms life*
*can't see the gestures*
I would like to see that
"Rolling a marathon" 😛
Anyone else have a better day than me?
🎉
You do that with everything I say
😒
I'm here now. Work still blows 😑
Sigh, work time 😭
*noms something out of boredom*
*waits impatiently*
Meh
Any suggestions?
Well, 5 minutes until I have to get ready for work. And I have nothing to do for 5 minutes 😑
This has been SquidofBaconator's random thought of the afternoon
Random thought: I have been eating a lot of ham sandwiches lately. Maybe I should get something else for a sandwich
Trade?
Espeon?
I still suggest Skitty 😛
Ok. I have to go to work in 20 minutes 😭
Solrock or Lunatone?
Hi Will
Skitty
I've been slowly losing interest ever since X and Y
I just realized. It's been a while since I played a Pokémon game. Probably ever since I got my Switch. I don't have as much interest in it as I used to
I once used a Crawdaunt. Can't remember if in Emerald or Omega Ruby. I really like it
Definitely stick with attack moves
This might help

^
😒
Why can't you cut paper straight?
😒
Well, I'm pretty sure I got an A on my Statistics quiz today
Hello
Well, I feel a little more relaxed now. At least until I have to get ready for work again in 2 hours 😑
I guess
🎉
Hmm... I woke up this morning feeling kind of stressed. And the semester has just started 😨
Good night for real
*noms screaming*
Ok, I really need to get out of here *Runs away frantically*
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Good night Kingdom of Introverted Ninnies Losing Brain Cells
Anyways, time to sleep. Tomorrow consists of a quiz and more work 😭
Bye Flubs. Have fun wherever you go
Sorry 😛
🤔
Rule 1: Don't bother trying to question Flubs logic. You'll just get a headache
Made from a chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen
<:Yea:327308337722949642> <:Yea:327308337722949642>
H2O
I see Flubs is still being Flubs
If no one has anything big/really interesting to say, I think I'll pass out in a few minutes. I have a Statistics quiz tomorrow morning...
Whatever
I'm level 32 now
It's been a week or two
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
It seems like that's all you say they're talking about
Is that all you guys think about?
I worked an 8 hour closing shift. Not good. I am probably going to hate my life for the rest of the week
So, has everyone's day been better than mine?
🎉
The Baconator is back after a long day of work
😑
Well, time to go back to hell for the rest of the day. Hooray...
Northeast Pennsylvania
Anyone want to do my job for me?
Ok, pretty soon, I have to work for the rest of the day till closing 😭
🔫 Nope
Are you feeling it now Mr Krabs?
Mr Krabs, can I have a raise?
👎
I have to do an 8 hour closing shift tonight
🎉
I already got it last December
Also, I think we're at 50 pins again 😛

Speaking of that, I haven't played Skyrim in a while
Why don't you just play Skyrim?
I forgot.
Meh. Was just on YouTube for almost an hour.
Meh
I guess it never got turned off
Ha
👍
Wait, Gummy's been renamed to Mr Krabs? Not something I'd expect to see when I woke up...
😒
😒
Hi Kugal. I'm going to bed
I call Bullskitty on the no more YouTube
😒
Well, time for bed
But I have no time or motivation to do anything. I think I hit burnout hard
I needed to edit a video for 2 1/2 weeks now.
Ok, I had enough of the old SuperSkarm videos for one night
😒
Aww...
🎉
"Please redeem fisherman's kind. PLEASE DON'T USE A MAGIKARP!" 
This a good quote? 😛
Some games just get old and less enjoyable for me. Pokemon is starting to get there
Now, things are different. Now I'm making YouTube videos and I have no idea how my parents would react to my videos 😐
Simple times when people didn't use capture cards
Going through these old videos is reminding me of simpler times. Times when I was younger and my parents didn't like me watching YouTube
That's a new one
Anyone remember this? 😛 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xW1w8hD1mLA
"Welcome to the show, where idiots like me try to catch legendary Pokemon in Pokeballs"
I forgot a lot of this
Lol, he nicknamed Barry "Ozzy" in Diamond 😐
This is kind of interesting, picking random episodes of old Pokemon videos to watch. Let's Plays have really evolved
Wow, his voice really changed
*Listening to Eyan's voice back in Pokémon Diamond* 😐
And now, I'm going to watch some early SuperSkarmory videos to find stupid quotes for a bot to say randomly when we say its name because I have nothing better to do
I think we need more Eyan quotes
It's always Majestic 😂
That sounds good
Here's a 🍪
Majestic, just step away from Discord. The bot can't steal the food away from Discord. YET...
This should be our theme song
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rAlTOfl9F2w
*noms my last sandwich before Skarm eats it*
I'm really enjoying this 😂
The robots are taking over by taking all our sandwiches
😒
The bot keeps stealing our food
Perfect
What are you even going to do with this food Skarm?
STOP IT
*Gives another sandwich to Eclipse*
Ok, this is just hilarious
*Steals Sandwich back from Skarm*
That has nothing to do with any of this
🔫 Give back the sandwich Skarm
😡
Burgers are technically sandwiches
🍔
e!sandwich Eclipse
*Plays song on the world's smallest violin*
And then Walmart for some tater tots.
Go to Wendy's
👍
*Puts down 🔫*
Aww...
"And he is apparently a gummy bear"
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
SIGH
I'm jumping back and forth between YouTube and this
Either that or everyone got there talking done when I wasn't here
Is it me or is the chat a little less active than usual tonight?
Thanks for this totally necessary information... *sarcasm*
And there are no tater tots...
StephenPlays
Oh shoot, someone uploaded a new video. Now I have something to do
😐
Someone tell me a joke
😭

With nothing but my thoughts to entertain me
😑
Well, it's SquidofBaconator's "I have nothing left to do and I'm bored" time of night again
Even this piece of lint?
What about me? 😛
I have myself as my role model. Or another Baconator
*Ignores this and goes back to NASCAR Heat 2*
It was meh
I did see that recent episode with going back to Kanto
Oh. Then yes
?
Gummy would just play TTG and the Sun and Moon anime
NASCAR it is then
You didn't ask me. And the answer is no
Didn't know you could do that
Idk
Now, Overwatch or NASCAR?
Ok, video game time.
😒
Too. Many. Reactions
Now every comment has reactions
Hence why it was removed
Sorry 😛
Why?
🎉
The school district has the kids from our town and a couple rural villages
Yeah. Kind of
Ok, so 3.2K people live in my town. 5.3K in the neighboring one
😐
Umm, a few square miles? No, I don't know everyone because I'm an introvert
Idk how many people live here
We need to drive a half hour for a lot of things
I Don't live in a city
Bland
Want me to talk about my town or have you guys had enough Town Talk?
Nothing
😏
No bank to rob
Now we have no reason to go to Gummy's town
Yes, I go to one
Does Canada have Walmart?
At least 40-50 minimum
They do that with schools around here
With how few people there are, you'd think they would combine a couple towns
😐
I have never heard of a senior class with only 17 people
We have towns like that with larger amounts of kids in school
Explain because I'm confused as f---
Something isn't right here
Ok, what the hell?
😐
Maybe in homeroom, but not the total amount of seniors
17 seniors in one high school?!
😐
The neighboring high school had 62 I think
There were around 150 people in my graduating class. One of the biggest compared to other schools in this rural area
500 people for one person?
Bullskitty
🤔
Lol
😏
"Grab party"
Do something productive instead
Those exist? I never heard of those
Just go play outside. Here, 🏈
Do we really need to correct my punctuation?
WHY DO YOU NEED A PRE GRAD PARTY?!
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
"Have fun with Flubs"
This is why I always thought high schoolers were idiots. Especially when I was in it
Stop
⏹
Does Gummy even HAVE common sense?
Be a good person for once
Stay home.
I just wouldn't serve them
When working, we're supposed to ask everyone for ID. I don't 95% of the time. Only to young people
Classmates for underage drinking. Bartender for serving them
Both
Sure
No
🤔
Perfect
😡
Meh
Someone pin me and Stuck getting in a fight with the bot 😛

Ha
😡
I only eat eggs when on a breakfast sandwich. I don't like just eating eggs
"People fight over eggs" I thought people were throwing eggs at each other
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
e!gummy-b
Why do I bother coming here...
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
😒
Weeb time is over. Gamer time starts now
Well, I'm done watching anime.
I don't have anything special, I think. I'm a console peasant, not a pc master race person
Well, dinner was disappointing
😐
Ok then...
😒
I feel tired and I don't know why
e!gummy-b
"This guy needs to get a job" - Some comment on one of my older videos
Hi
I'm back. Just saw the pin. I wonder what we can find from the older videos 😛
I believe the dog likes me the most so 1 point for me! 😃
I remember my sister's dog a lot of times kept laying on my feet like he wanted to be petted. And he wouldn't move for a couple minutes
Lol
I always feel like I wake up too early...
Sigh
GOOD NIGHT
🔪
Night Kingdom of Ninnies
Ok, I'm getting off Discord
Aww...
:skunk:
Bleh
😉
😏
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
He's all yours
Flubs, go sit in the corner
😛
You calling Eyan Ugly and Dumb?
Beautiful

<:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
I'm watching Bob Ross videos
Well, it's been mostly just you and me for a little while now here. I guess we're the ones who don't have a life or anything better to do 😛
🎉
I hate life...
So...
Anyways, tomorrow is my last relaxing day for a while since I have to work 4 days in a row starting Sunday
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Again: Sounds like a you problem
They might kick you
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Sounds like a you problem
Move to another match
😐
🤔
Sigh
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
🤔
I hate coffee
That only helps you...
I'm tired...
*Goes back to going back to something*
*Goes back to watching Bob Ross videos*
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
Or a locker
This is why we call you a baka, you baka
*Picks up golf club* Let's do it RC
Night Ida. Good luck not dying
*Pokes Gummy with a golf club*
😒
What...
e!gummy-b
Flubs, I already have dibs on the stick figure art
Then until the janitor gets there Saturday
Well, guess you're staying there until tomorrow when people actually come
*Slams the locker door shut*
^
😃
😑
Ok, so there were 3 main problems: 1) I found out next week I'll be working 5 days a week and that always pisses me off especially since I have little time to do college work
2) The machines for the credit/debit cards kept not working due to a bad internet connection or something and that took up a good chunk of the day which was made even more frustrating when my register just froze and it needed to be restarted. It was also REALLY busy all day so that made everything worse
3) Towards the end, it got really busy for no reason and I wasn't able to do much at all so I had to get out when I could
Well, nothing was working right today. This might be long
Oh.
Talk about what?
😏
I thought VN was Visual Novel 😛
Dragonoob, you can never quit the internet
*Pokes Gummy* Stop being a baka
You could've punched him in the face
Except if you're Gummy. Then you can call him a baka all the time
e!gummy
Mine was bad the whole way through
Screw your amazing day
That didn't help 😑
Ok, can someone just hit me and stop me from going further mad?
Gee, hope it gets better. *It won't*
So SquidofBaconator, how was work today? *It was a terrible f-ing day*
Ok, now it's my thoughts again
Yep
Well, back to just me and my thoughts
😒
🤔
Play outside
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg4Eui4sGlk
MUSIC?!!
e!gummy-b
😏
Are you feeling it now?
And now I'm hungry brb
I don't get any retakes in my current classes
*the more you know*
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
Agreed
Yes. The weather is 3
So, how about that weather?
😑
Perfect
TOO MUCH MATH
🤔
Again, n'aww
*Throws dog a bone*
Aww
Maybe
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
YES
🤔
I really need a good laugh. Today was probably one of the worst days at work I had in a long time
"Runs away" and Flubs don't really fit together...
🤔
🍔
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
😏
Flubs, I ain't in the mood for that shit
F--K MY JOB. IT CAN GO TO HELL FOR ALL I CARE
Well, time for work 😑
I have a Statistics quiz Monday
🎉
...drive. Take a bus
😑
And shouldn't you be in class or studying?
...why?
Add that to the list of "Things Wrong With Gummy"
The acting is so bad, it's hilarious. None of these interactions feel real 😛
Like these video simulations that have people acting out situations and you need to answer a couple questions to find the best solution
Ok, some of the assignments in this online course are just ridiculous 😛
Well, it SquidofBaconator's weekly "Get work done that you procrastinated to the last minute" time 🎉
I don't like keeping things in the fridge for over a week
Why was the pasta in your fridge for 2 weeks? 😛
Ok, class time
Like, back in high school, I was on the golf team and the morning of my first matches, I can't eat because it'll just come right back up
😑
I always hate it. I have some pretty bad anxiety problems. I get anxious over a lot of little things. At my worst times, I can get sick because of it
Why am I still here? *Goes back to watching YouTube*
I'm not doing that
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
You know even less
You know nothing
Lol
😏
OTHER parts of the internet
See you ninnies some other time
Ok, I'm done here. Back to the internet.
We do get occasional blizzards here. One year, we got a couple feet of snow. Same year Boston had like 5 feet
That pun sucks
At least it doesn't appear to be hitting Florida. Thankfully
😒
Shit, I think Tropical Storm Jose is coming up the east coast 😨
🎉
This feels fitting
Whatever
Buy some hot chocolate
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aJX4ytfqw6k
I like that
People can like whatever they want.
I HATE bitter chocolate
Someone want to get to work on all of this? 😛
😨
:kappaBaconator:
Happy Little Sky
<:KappaRoss:327309186629107712>

Who knew thinking would bring such strong reactions?

<:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
I'm now an Overachiever
I was playing Salmon Run today
🤔
Random thought: All Bob Ross is doing right now is show the tools he's using and I'm really interested for no reason 😛
Meh
Use the Joy Cons then
I'm still unsure of buying any other Sonic games
I probably won't buy that
I have Mania. Not Forces
BoTW, Splatoon 2, Arms, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Sanic Mania
*Goes back to Bob Ross*
Oh god, he's back...
I have 5 games for my Switch. 6 when Oddessy comes out
Dark chocolate sucks
e!gummy-b
Thing 1 and Thing 2
Kind of like Minecraft
Terraria looks a little boring to me
Dammit, you guys keep distracting me from Bob Ross 😑
😛
That's one more than me <@106654620876603392>
Waldo?
Zaldo?
I played OoT, A Link Between Worlds, and BoTW
I never played Wind Waker
Meat cleaver? PERFECT
Tingle always creeped me out
*Plays Home Alone, forces Gummy to watch with Flubs's love, and throws steel and poison at him*
What's his biggest weakness? In case he's still kicking
Dammit Flubs! You jeopardized the entire operation!
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
This is great for people with no social lives. LIKE ME 😃
😐
Ok, now I want to watch Bob Ross videos now
*Goes to YouTube*
And beating the devil out of brushes
No wait, all I know is what Bob Ross taught me. Titanium White, Vandyke Brown, and all that jazz
If I took a placement exam for art class, I would be back in Kindergarten learning basic colors
All I can do is draw stick figures
Is that how we made Gummy's Brain?
<:Yea:327308337722949642>
🤔
No, I just need to think about different things
Ok, I got to stop thinking everything is a dirty joke/innuendo
"First time is always the hardest" 😏
Is she related to Flubs?
No stairs
I'm just in my room
Seriously, I get too much amusement out of this bot
I'm just putting clothes away
🤔
Well, time to do laundry
I get too much amusement out of this 😂
It's official: Skarmbot likes to drink beer
😃
It's American to drink beer
🍺
*Helps somehow*
😏
Moral of the story: Gummy has bad taste in everything
We should file a restraining order on Gummy
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
No
I'm such a model student
I could have done my homework, but I procrastinated it to tomorrow. And it's due tomorrow night. And I have to go to my job so that makes my time a lot more limited
Look what you made me do: Make a bad song
Her new #1 song sucks
😑
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Do you even know the band Disturbed, Flubs?
😒
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4
Discount Rocket Lavos?
Can someone get rid of the Overwatch ninnies?
This is boring. First match, I'm in at the end of it and now, I can't get into one 😑
See you ninnies in about 40 minutes
Ok, this is boring. back to video games.
Just go outside *Throws Gummy outside and locks the door*
e!gummy-b
Can we talk about something else or I'll just go back to video games
What does slowmode do?
Why do you guys do this EVERY NIGHT
🔫
PLEASE GET BANNED
Go play outside
I still like it 😛
*Raps the Pokemon D&P theme*
*Proceeds to rap*
If that's the case...
e!gummy-b
What?
NO FRENCH FLAG
I love it when people do the reaction the same as the emote
<:KappaPride:327304358830145536>
😒
How about we lock Gummy and Stuck in a room for the rest of the night so they don't bother us?
😑😑😑
:RealBaconator:
*Eats rice ball* 🍩
*noms Baconator*
<:Kappa:305551256104206336>
You heard him. Ban Flubs 😛
Can we ban Flubs and Gummy for the rest of the night?
No
That's nothing to upvote...
I have no special traits. I'm boring 😑
Everyone says hi here
🍔
😑
Oh hai Chewy
🤔
Soon, we all die 😛
This server is crashing down on us
😛
THINK?!
🤔
e!flubs: Flubs, you're a baka
I've been here a month longer than Flubs
Wait, is Flubs newer than me? 😐
😐
1 out of every 4 messages are from these 2
🎉
Except I have a job and college to worry about
I probably have less of a life than each of you
Stay in school Gummy
Well, they ARE number 1 and 3 people on the server
I try to say other things, but people ignore them half the time 😑
I get tired of them
I'm procrastinating my homework that's due tomorrow night to tomorrow
Tired
Oh hai Bella
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
No, he IS crazy and he thinks moronically
Gummy bear or Sylveon
No. I just noticed it when I did the e!gummy command
So, has someone turned it off or something?
Well, see you at the bottom of the stairs
<:Thinking:325447327940870145>
🤔
It's "Go play outside Dragonite"
<:Yea:327308337722949642> or <:Nay:327308337706434570>
🤔
Now how can we tell Gummy to go outside?
I just saw that.
e!gummy-b
😛
So, will you be stuck stalking Stuck?
🤔
So, what's going on? The usual?
And now I'm here because Downloading
Which is why I deleted it
Speaking of math, I have math tomorrow
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Although, I do have homework to do 😑
I've been done for 2 hours now 😛
😑
I'm home 🎉
Whatever. Time for lab...
The person doing this is kind of annoying
Surprisingly a lot of people for Bingo
Half an hour till lab
I'm a Baconator so I'm not sure how I'm able to eat, let alone how much I eat
You're a gummy bear. I'm not sure how that works
🍪
🍕
When I die, it's probably going to be while I'm busy stuffing my face
😐
I have 2 slices of pizza, French fries, 2 cookies, and a soda
Sometimes, I wonder how I'm still not fat
Only 3 people ahead of me
I think there's classes going on or something
On Thursdays, I can easily be one of the first people there
I remember first semester on Mondays and Wednesdays, there was always a long line
And I'm still waiting for the dining area to open
e!gummy-c: Stop being lazy, Gummy
Yep
So, how can you not go to school until 10? Back at my school, even if you had study hall 1st period, you needed to come sign in for attendance
6:20 back in high school for me
I get up at 7 every morning
https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=LLeiDF7yonqPf9alr1C9WgOQ&v=rAlTOfl9F2w
Early? What time is it there?
It's a little boring but at least I brought my Switch
😒
It's so fun: there's even Bingo today 🎉
Fun day for everyone 
*sarcasm*
Have a half hour to wait until then
Hopefully the food here is good today
Yep
And it's raining so I don't feel like going anywhere 😐
I'm pretty sure if I did so, I wouldn't have much time there. Under an hour
I wish I lived closer to the college. Then I would just go home
Hello
😑
And now, my weekly 2 1/2 hour wait until bio lab begins once again
Words words words
Ok, I can't look at this any longer. I need to go to bed before I lose my remaining brain cells
<:FailFish:327304577261240322>
Meh.
Gummy, you have bad taste in music. Except for hating Katy Perry
Bad
Wish that was an emote 😛
:dunce-cap:
You can play solo. Have you seen Forrest Gump? 😛
🏓
I haven't played ping pong in a long time
*Ping pong*
👌
No
YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eFVj0Z6ahcI
😂
If it's you, I call bias
Flubs is writing a ~~bad~~ Hunger Games fanfic
You better invest in a prosthetic Animal Man 😐
Why does it matter? Your legs don't work that well anyways 😛
Lul
I'm losing it...
WELCOME TO THE CLUB
WELCOME TO THE CLUB
WELCOME SQUIDWARD
WELCOME SQUIDWARD 
WELCOME SQUIDWARD
I hate writing
Well, it's that time of night again. I have ran out of things to do and I don't want to go to sleep yet
😑
😒
I'm talking about the 🤔
For once, I agree with Flubs:
<:Nay:327308337706434570>
DON'T QUESTION IT
Vader forgot to close the window
Large area
*YOU'RE LYING*
*Said in Vader's voice*
No, I am your brother
CAPS LOCK
Uhh...should someone change his name? Or tell him to?
"Worst hunger games clone"
*This is hungergames*
🤔
I have ran out of things to talk about
Well...
😏
You'd think he would be first blood
Oh. Why didn't Gummy die yet?
Oh. Did you kill me off yet?
Again, what are you guys talking about? I have no idea what's going on...
What are you talking about?
e!gummy-b
Thank you Flubs for making me lose even more brain cells. I'm feeling dumber by the minute
I leave for a couple minutes and it gets really violent...
😐
🔪 Don't come near me
Right. Why?
😛
e!gummy-d: Go play Breath of The Wild Gummy
I liked Fallout 4. And Skyrim. And DOOM 2016
I hated Fallout 3
No, that's Fallout 3
*Beats Flubs with 🤔*
Blasphemy
e!gummy-c: Go play Skyrim Gummy
I like a couple of the Need for Speed games
😒
People do that in online multiplayer
NASCAR Heat 2
Most of you probably wouldn't like it. It's the new Nascar game
I just got a new game
🤔
👍
A thought? 🤔
I thought I told you to play outside?
Don't be a Baka
Doubt it
🤔
What?
e!gummy-b
Only in the Kingdom of Introverts Losing Brain Cells
Yep, losing brain cells already
😒
Don't live there. You need to walk
Well, I did everything I wanted to tonight. Now to lose more brain cells on Discord
Lol
🔪
Ok, I must go now
I am a loser. A loser with a job
😛
"Look who just got a job!" 
"Look who just quit."
I've had it for over a year now
😐
Why? Are you all dying again?
At least Sunday, I may have an 8 hour shift, but I at least get a break
It's only a 3 hour shift. THANK GOD. I'm tired of working long shifts with no break.
I have to get ready for work now 😑
SIIIIGH
SIGH
😑
You calling me bad?
Meh
*noms Town of Salem*
*Takes away any distractions*
*Helps with that*
That's bad news. Good news would be to not have to do any essays
Hi Will
Study 😛
Of course she liked you. It was in your dreams. No go back to class
Idk
😒
Ok then 😑
