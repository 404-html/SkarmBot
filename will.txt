Hi Bella ^w^
I would've said the death sentence but that sounds a little too extreme lol
Give or take yeah lol
But she'll probably agree to letting us arrest gummy anyways lol
Mhm
^
Lol
We can always replace the tv lol
Lol ^w^
If we can also go by fire emblem terms an assassins class used to be in the theif class before being promoted therefore I do have a certain skill that can unlock the door like nothing lol XD
And I was tempted to use it <:Kappa:305551256104206336>
Yes I just found a random grenade that's all lol
Hmm?
^
Mhm lol ^w^
Fine *Mila's Turnwheel to turn back time to the point before she blew up the door and doesn't do that again* there lol
*will replace it later*
Lol
*blows up the door using a random grenade* lol
I call being an assassin lol
Lol
*distracts eyan by poking him every few minutes* <:Kappa:305551256104206336> lol
Lions and tigers lol

flicks gummy on the nose
XD
Lol
Lol

Lol
A Judo kickboxing self defense and jiu jutsu student to be extact
You do realize that you're messing with someone that has several years of experience in the martial arts department right? Lol
*blocks punch*
*flicks gummy on the nose*
Lol
*has nowhere near that amount of money*
I mean I don't have a capture card or anything and whatnot lol

Gotta love it lol XD

Why not now lol
Maybe before eyan starts streaming lol
Whenever you play again lol
Camilla in a nutshell lol
Lol
None of the seals that can be obtained in the game and dlcs lol
Nope lol
^
And trust me it's harder than you think to go through the game without using any seals and stuff lol
Since you're playing on Phoenix mode you just needed an added challenge lol
Ikr lol
You have to play through the entire game without changing anyone's classes at all
Ok gummy I have a challenge for you to do on fire emblem lol
Lol yeah ^w^
How are you guys doing ^w^
Nothing much just chilling and stuff lol ^w^

Wow O.o
Like during the fall semester of last year I took early morning classes and let's just say I would've been lucky to even get an ounce of sleep the entire semester lol
Lol yeah
That sounds like my own sleep schedule lol
Lol XD
My sleep schedule has always been messed up lol

Can always rewrite it lol
Good enough lol XD

One sentence? Lol
Not even a small piece of it?
I might just be an author alongside being an artist lol
And 3 or 4 large binders and several notebooks included into the collection lol
7 years of work = stacks among stacks of papers lol
There are times where I do prefer writing over reading tho lol
Dang
There's like at least quite a few books in every corner of my room lol

For someone who is used to rolling with brown and black belts during my judo days it's kinda hard to go easy on people lol
Hi bree ^w^
I might've hurt them a bit tho lol
Nope lol
Being a bit too rough when performing a technique
I think I scared off a handful of people making then not really want to be my partner and whatnot lol
Mhm lol
Well if it's like how the judo finals are it's more like the teacher naming out a technique and we have to perform it lol
Lol
Why? Aren't most colleges like that? Lol
Like the first final I have to do is for self defense and all we have to do is perform certain techniques
It just depends on the class for me lol
Me neither but I have a final in about 2 and a half hours
Lol
